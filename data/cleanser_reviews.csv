B017703KSY," This has been so amazing for my skin! It has cleared and brightened my complexion. The moisturizer is hydrating, but does not make my combination skin oily. The eye cream has helped the darkness under my eyes. The serum has helped fade acne scars. I just bought the full sizes - two weeks of use has convinced me of its super powers! I have noticed such a difference in my face in such a short amount of time - I can't wait to see the results after months of use! And did I mention the packaging is lovely? :)I also bought the exfoliating clay mask - LOVE! I highly recommend these products. They are worth the money. The products I have used from the drugstore either leave my face dry and tight, or oily - both of which will cause breakouts. The high-end products I have used causes purging - and then weeks of scarring that takes forever to fade. Tula products feel - and smell - so good; no oily residue, a clean feeling that does not cause dryness, no noticeable purging, and it helps fade old scars and dark spots. Plus, they aren't tested on animals - which is so wonderful, and sadly so hard to find.Keep it up, Tula! You have a lifelong customer right here! So far so good. I like things with no fragrance. I have had no irritation and my skin looks good. I think this is a good line for people with very sensitive skin like myself. I'm allergic to everything but this is workin nicely! I'll keep ordering Really great stuff!  My skin looks and feels amazing. Was a bit worried about the fragrance due to my extremely sensitive skin, but my skin didn't react badly from it. Especially loved the Illuminating Face Serum.  It's wonderful that they have this kit to try out before buying full sized products. Would definitely recommend! I'm loving this kit and using it as a travel set. I love that it came in it's own little travel pouch. Will order again. I am 57 years of age. I spent a lot of my teenage years at the beach exposing my face. I never wore sunscreens.  So far, I have been using the product for approximately 3 weeks. I do like the results. My skin does feel very clean and moisturized and healthy! So far, so good. I would definitely recommend this product. Great product line; simple; there aren't 101 products in the line that you have to wade through to decide which ones are right for you and they truly make my skin look and feel better.  Well worth it. Perfect size to travel with, with a really good amount of product in the small tubes. The products go on smooth to your skin and it doesn’t feel like you have anything on your face. Nice introduction to this product. Can definitely see a change in my skin, even tone and minimizing wrinkles. The ingredients are natural . Will definitely consider making part of my daily skin routine. I'm literally in LOVE with all of my TULA products!  Highly recommend. In love with these. Wish the full size products were not so expensive. This is absolutely the best. Can see and feel the difference and I am 70 Excellent product from an excellent seller!!  Highly recommend. Just love this product.  Will buy again. nice starter kit, generous products, not skimpy. Feels great on my skin, so far so good I like it  so much!! Love the brand.  My skin feels really nourished. Love it. I'm giving this five starts mainly for the illuminating serum. I freaking love that stuff! The rest I can take or leave. This set is great for travel and came with a really nice travel bag! I don't have any complaints about the fave wash, eye cream, or moisturizer it just doesn't wow me like the illuminating serum! The serum gives you that glowing dewy look everyone wants and seems to make my mineral foundation go on smoother when I use it before putting on makeup! I have been using TULA starter kit for a couple days now and I absolutely love it. The kit includes purifying face cleanser - 1 fl oz, illuminating face serum - 0.5 fl oz, hydrating day and night cream - 0.5 oz and revitalizing eye cream -0.25 oz. It all comes in a pretty silver color travel bag. So it's a perfect traveling kit that has everything you need to take care of your face skin. The purifying face cleanser is very gentle, feels good on my skin, hydrates it right after application, creates creamy foam with water. The illuminating face serum has a bit liquid texture, it absorbs to skin fast and doesn't feel greasy. It leaves my skin moisturized right away and it also has light pleasant scent. The hydrating day and night cream has a bit heavier texture and it's perfect for night time skin hydration. It leaves my skin really smooth. The revitalizing eye cream works very good on my eye area, moisturizes skin and leaves it feeling fresh, my eyes don't feel tired. I didn't get any skin reaction or irritation using these products. I love that it contains beautiful ingredients like blueberry fruit extract, lemon and orange oils, turmeric and chicory root extracts, grape seed oil and jojoba seed oil extracts and much more. The main that it contains milk protein and yogurt extracts that are so good for skin and make it youthful, fresh and healthy. I am very happy with my purchase and recommend it to all women who love to use high quality, natural skin care products. I received this product at a discount price in exchange for my honest opinion. I received this product kit over a month ago, and I decided to wait on writing a review so I could use it and give an honest review about my experience with this brand.  This set is perfect for those who just want to try it before committing to the regular size products. I've been using this Tula Kit for over a month and I have noticed an improvement on my skin. The cleanser is a gentle gel and it foams as you add water. The eye treatment is a smooth cream and that one turned out to be one of my favorites. I use the serum and moisturizer together and it does not feel heavy on your skin, your skin absorbs it almost immediately and you will love the feeling that these two products do for your skin. I use this whole set at night so that my skin can absorb and take advantage of all the great things this set provides for your skin. I have noticed a huge difference in the morning, my skin feels soft, smooth and it looks healthy. Let me tell you that the scent of these products are absolutely fantastic, I wish I could have a perfume made of the scent because it is so pleasant and it puts me in such a great mood before bed. It's an elegant soft smell that just brings this whole set together. Not only does it smell great, but these products are amazing and they have provided me with great results. Now, I know not everyone's skin is the same. I normal to oily skin and break out on a regular basis, however, I haven't notice as many breakouts since I started using Tula. Overall, I absolutely love this skin care set and the brand. The only CON to this brand is their prices. Because this is a started kit it the price wasn't so bad. But I can't afford to pay $52 for just one full size product, however, I think I know what I will be adding to my Christmas gift list.I did receive this product at a discounted price for my honest unbiased opinion. I am not obligated by the seller to give a good review nor am I compensated for giving one. I rely on reviews to make a final purchase so I hope this review was helpful to you. Like most people, I have sensitive skin. Tried many products that didn't show any improvements. When I heard about the TULA line, I figured I should try it. Glad I did cause it has work for me. I have and use the whole Tula line. From the cleanser, exfoliating mask, neck cream, eye cream, day and night cream , illuminating serum, deep wrinkle serum. Love them all.. I bought this set like I have most other skincare products in my life, hoping it would be the solution for acne and evening my skin tone, but already thinking about what I would order when this didn't work. I was blown away by the results and after a week saw such an improvement I ordered the full size products and have been using them since. The science behind the products absolutely works. This starter kit is ABSOLUTELY perfect to try out (almost) all of Tula's products. You get to try a combo of 4 different products and they are just amazing. I've ordered 3 packs now just so I can use the eye cream and face wash for travel. They are the perfect size and last surprisingly long! Presentation on this 4 piece skin care line was impressive.....tissue paper and all!  Pumps work good and consistency of lotion and creams are nice.  I tried it once so far and my skin feels great.  I received this product at a discount for my honest review. I will not travel anywhere without my travel set! It's the perfect size of my absolute favorite products. I no longer need to re-bottle my Tula products because Tula makes it so easy to travel with! Thanks Tula :) Start Here!  This is the exact set that caused me to fall in love with TULA. The cleanser is so kind to the skin and leaves it refreshed, but not tight.The other 3 core products exceeded my high expectations. I saw reduced redness and fine lines. TULA leaves a glow to my skin that I've never experienced with other skin care lines. The ingredients are steeped in a history of health giving benefits and the added probiotics...well that makes perfect sense to me. And my skin agrees. Prepare to fall in love with TULA and the way your skin looks."
B0000ZHOEU," Great addition to the Vanicream lotion for very sensitive skin.  Love the double pack! Great product With a fragrance allergy, I have to be careful about the soaps I use. Everything in the Vanicream/Vaniply/Free & Clear lines has worked great for me and hasn't irritated my skin. These are small bottles for the price, so I just ordered the 32-oz. refill so I can pour that into the pumps. This body wash lathers well and doesn't smell like anything. It's not too drying, but doesn't leave a film. I use this because of specific chemical skin allergies I have to dimethylaminopropylamine (a byproduct of cocamidopropyl betaine,) diagnosed by an allergist&dermatologist. Thank goodness for this product! I have sensitive skin and this doesn't negatively affect my hands like so many products do. I use it over and over. Great stuff, especially if you have sensitive skin. Costs way more than the regular stuff but if you have skin allergies like I do, it is worth it. Recommended by Dermatolgist.  love it ! Some soaps can make a skin problem worse. This one is safe and effective. Love this soap! Makes an excellent face wash for sensitive skin and leaves my skin feeling very clean without drying it out or leaving a residue. It was so good to find Free and Clear products once I was diagnosed with sensitive skin. all my itches have gone. The only thing that has helped my daughter’s eczema. Two days of using this lotion and it was completely clear after months of horrible rash looking skin that itched so bad she would scratch constantly, sometimes until she bled. Great lotion!! I like this body wash. I do think it helps with my dry skin problem. It helps control the itching. My son and I both have eczema and have difficulty finding body wash that isn't irritating to our skin. After a few weeks of using the product we have experienced no issues. Great product This is my favorite facial cleanser for the last 3 years. I went through many products until I found this one (Philosophy Purity was the last one before that). I used to have a mixed to oily and acne prone skin, but since I started using this product my face cleared up and I don't breakout that often. The ugly - ""can't hide acne"" stage is over and my skin tone is even now. You have to definitely try it if you still have acne in your late 30s. Pretty good for acne prone skin thays been through torture ,recently ...my dermatologist suggested it. Gentle enough for makeup removing as well.Thank you Really Fragrance-Free and it works!Free&Clear and Vanicream products are perfect for me because I'm allergic to most fragrances. They have minimal ingredients, so fewer things to be allergic to. And they work well. I use the Hair Gel, Shampoo, Conditioner, Skin Cream, Lite Lotion, Vaniply Ointment, and Liquid Cleanser. All are great products and I am really grateful for the lack of perfumes, masking fragrances, and unneeded botanical ingredients that could cause allergies.The Liquid Cleanser doesn't dry out my skin. It also works as a shampoo in a pinch. Great for a person who has multiple allergies and food sensitivities.  Lathers nicely and rinses off exceptionally well,  no slimy residue left after washing. It cleans hands without drying them out. Having no odor is great. I have many allergies. Will buy again. A very nice and gentle cleanser for my infant son who has eczema! Finally a product that does not irritate my childs skin My dermatologist recommended this soap for my sensitive skin. I think its helping a lot. Amazing cleanser. Nothing in it that breaks me out. Probably too drying if you have really dry skin, but great if you're really oily or only a little dry. Great if you're dealing with acne, totally non-comedogenic. No fatty alcohols or irritating sulfates. I devolved a medical that made me highly sensitive to fragrancess/dyes and this product worked wonders as both a hand soap and an all over body soap.It cut down my itchy/irritates spells by over half alone and lathered very well! Very good, non drying.  The bottle lasts a long time and is free of perfumes and chemicals.  If you have sensitive skin, this is superior to Phisoderm.  I have heard from others that they found this to be too drying for their skin, in which case I would recommend using along with Complex15 facial creme (which is now best ordered overseas or from eBay as it is no longer available at a reasonable price here in the states.  Note what it is now being sold for here at Amazon.  Still about $8 on eBay and Canadian pharmacy websites). Other hand soaps typically strip my skin and I can smell the remnants of their fake/terrible melon or orange or apple scents for a good 15 minutes afterwards, horrible!This smells like nothing, cleans well, and is gentle. It is the best! Whenever I have people over, someone always comes out of the bathroom raving about this soap, and I even find that a diluted solution of about 1 to 1 suits my purposes (light living, not a motor rebuilding hobbyist). I originally saw this because my mom got some free samples and I decided to give it a try. I absolutely fell in love with it because there is nothing harmful in this cleanser. There are no fragrances or dyes or other unnecessary ingredients and for me, that's all I want in a cleanser. I don't need all that extra stuff that could be more harmful than good. I used this for a couple years so far and I can't say enough good things. Amazing cleanser. Very gentle and effective. Happy with the ""unscentedness'. Excellent hand soap if you have allergies! The only line that my son can use with his eczema and allergies. Always a favorite of mine.  Free of everything and does he job. Gentle and refreshing great product Works great This is the only soap that I can find that doesn't cause my eczema to flair.  Great product and great value. Also super great for cleaning makeup brushes! I bought this for my mom due to she has Asthma and can't have any nice smells. I didn't know they came out as a face cleaner until I saw this and my mom is very happy and please she can wash her face without having problems with smells that will affected her Asthma. Will be buying more this in the near future. <3333 My skin is SO sensitive, and this is the only face wash that I have tried that doesn't irritate my skin or break out my eczema. So glad to have found this product line. I love this cleanser! My doctor gave me a few samples of this to try, because I have psoriasis on my face and everything I had tried made it worse. I use it with a facial cleanser brush and it works great! It cleared up all my blackheads, I didn't get pimples while using the samples, and it did not irritate my psoriasis at all! Once my samples were gone, I ordered this. Well worth it! Absolutely love this product! I have very sensitive skin and I saw my skin clear up in about 3 days. It makes my face feel clean and fresh. You only need to use a small amount and it foams up very nicely. Will definitely be purchasing again. Love this product. Was recommended by my dermatologist. I have not had any problems with my face since using this. The BEST cleanser ever! I am allergic or sensitive to so many products, BUT not this one. My Dermatologist highly recommended that I stop all the skin and hair products I was using and switch to Free and Clear Cleanser, Vanicream and Vaniply. I was hesitant because of going through so many products. Well, I wised up and purchased them. I am so grateful for these products and recommend them with highly. I’ve been using this on my new tattoo and it works great, very gentle and lathers very nicely, sometimes doesn’t take all of the ointment off, but that could be my fault. Works well for my daughter's eczema If you have been searching for something without harsh chemicals and junk that you can not pronounce then this will be up your alley. I have tried it all from drugstore to fancy department store brands. Save your money and time ----go ahead and get this along with the refill bottle. It's super gentle for the most sensitive acne prone skin. Recently became very sensitive to surfactants in products. Free & Clear has been a great find with zero irritation! This is the only face wash I have ever used that doesn't make my skin feel tight. I hope it is never discontinued! Recommended by my dermatologist.  I was afraid it would be bad or medicinal but was pleased with the texture and foaming. Absolutely the best & only skin cleanser, whether washing my face or bathing, that I'd ever use. Even though it's marketed for sensitive skin, everyone should use this! No harsh chemicals here! My Mayo Clinic dermatologist recommended this to my mother, who suffers from a severe dermatological autoimmune disease, & her skin is actually healing! No scent or greasiness, yet after you dry yourself off, your skin feels so clean & soft. I suffer from severe urticaria & hives & this stops both in their tracks! Buy this, you'll be thrilled with it! My skin is sensitive to strong wash. Therefore I tried many kinds of facial wash featuring ""mild"" and this is the most suitable for me. Some kinds of ""mild"" wash may leave my face turning greasy in several hours but this one wouldn't. I feel my cheek staying tender and clean whole day long, even when going out. Plus, the pimples used to grow on my nose is under control after switching to this product for a week. In brief, I'll keep buying it in the future. Satisfied with this product best cleanser for sensitive skin, Cleansing without harshly drying out or irritating your skin. Finally a soap gentile enough my sensitive skin can tolerate. Recommended for dry, sensitive skin by my dermatologist.  Works great!  Shipment arrived promptly, as stated even during the mad Christmas rush!  Thanks Amazon for fantastic pricing & service! I love this stuff.  No weird smell, leaves your hands nice and clean with no residue. This cleanser is great! I wish I had found it sooner just to use as a make up remover. It gets everything off and doesn't leave a trace of anything behind. It's gentle and very effective. It doesn't dry out my skin either, which is nice! Love it! This liquid cleanser is very effective in cleaning water soluble substances and more free of unnecessary or undesirable substances than any other I know about.  I use it to preserve the health of my skin and to clean the brushes I use to do art work while avoiding the accidental introduction of impurities into my art work after cleaning brushes. My dermatologist recommended this face wash to use along with Vaniply ointment.  All of a sudden I became allergic to my makeup.  This product is gentle and got things back to normal.  I recommend if you need a nice foaming gentle face wash. We love this product, my daughter loves it Since all liquid cleansers contain wheat this works great for those of us that have had to eliminate wheat from our diet. I have issues with very sensitive skin. My doctor mentioned this product ... I replaced the soap in the shower with this and I love it.  It rinses off without residue and leaves my skin feeling soft ... not dry and tight.  So far so good! This works great for my son who has eczema. He does not break out into a rash when we use this. Doesn't have as much suds as I would like but will be our go to soap from now on. Not only is there no perfume smell, the smell of the cleanser itself is mild and pleasant.Works great on face. For me it's too drying on the scalp when attempting to use as a shampoo. My four year old daughter has extremely sensitive skin. She was having rash after rash and other odd skin conditions until the dermatologist suggested this brand for all her cleanser, shampoo, conditioner, ect.  This cleanser works great and does not irritate the skin.  We  use for general hand washing and for bath time with ease.  My daughter doesn't love the same, mainly because there isn't one.  But it's a great product and would recommend. I have twins who are very allergic to almost anything that touches their skin.  This soap works fantastically.  They have never broken out, it doesn't dry their skin out and it leave them smelling very fresh and clean.  I have been using it on them since they were 6 months old and I use it myself.  IT doesn't say tear free but never seems to bother them when it gets in their eyes. I love this cleanser. After use it leaves your face clean feeling, not squeaky clean like some bars of soap, but a real nice clean. My face is not greasy afterwards either, no lotion feel.  It removes my make up well too. You only need a little too.  My only complaint is I can't get all the liquid out with the pump. I bought this product because I suffer from eczema and I cannot use items with scent, which everything I find at the store contains fragrance. I use it after playing with my dogs, when my hands tend to really itch. This wash immediately took away the pet dander and there was no itch. It lathered well and did the job! I highly recommend it. I have problem skin, this is the ONLY thing I have ever found that works. I can recommend this product 110%! I also use the Vanicream, another wonderful product! Wonderful product and at an exceptionally low price, Would recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin and there is no lingering too-sweet oder. Have been using for many years. I bought this as a cleanser for my 2y old with eczema. This foams up really well and is very gentle on the skin. I'm pregnant with my third right now and can't use my normal facial cleanser thanks to certain ingredients so I've been using this on my face as well and it doesn't leave my face red and splotchy like other products. All around great wash. My daughter has eczema and cannot use any other soap.  She keeps a bottle at school as well and hasn't had any flare ups on her hands since she started using! If you have allergies this product is wonderful! I love this soap for cleaning my face and hands. I have very sensitive skin and I've never had a bad reaction to any Vanicream or Free & Clear product. I have very sensitive combination skin and this stuff does the trick. Cleanses well without drying out my skin. I like this better than cetaphil (my previous tried and true) because i like the lathering. The shampoo version not so good (dries out my hair and scalp). I love this cleanser.  I use it as a face wash.  My face is feeling softer and cleaner every time I use it.  I think the lack of harsh chemicals really is making a difference for me.  I really love it!  I thought I needed a daily scrub to get everything clean, but this very gentle cleanser does that for me and does it way better than anything else I've tried.  Try it! I've used this for over a year and it is the only facial cleanser that cleans and doesn't irritate my super sensitive skin (atopic dermatitis plus numerous food sensitivities). I use this cleanser on my face. I like how clean it is compared to a lot of cleansers with loads of chemicals. Recommended by my dr and I'm happy with it. Love this wash. Light and no fragrance. Good for my combo-sensitive skin. Does not dry out the skin nor does it feel stripped. Put on a light moisturizer of same line and great to go. Totally recommend for those with or without problem skin. It came in an orderly fashion, liked that packaging wasn't damaged when I received it. I have eczema and I like to use products that are alcohol, parfum, dyes and etc free. It doesn't worsen my eczema, and it doesn't cause any redness. So all in all a good body wash esp people with sensitivities. Hopefully this helps Mild cleanser that was recommended by my dermatologist for my sensitive, eczema prone, skin.Works great! I am allergic to all antibacterial soaps and some others as well.  I have successfully used this cleanser for several years.  It cleans thoroughly and is mild.  I recommend it. I have terrible exczema and allergies to everything with scent.  This cleanser I can use for everything and it's mild enough not to bother me, but strong enough to keep my hands and face clean. Fast Delivery. This product is very good on my skin. My dermatogist suggested I wash my face with free & clear. This is my second time ordering. My skin is definitely clearer & smoother. Love this stuff. I bought it to help reduce redness in my skin and it's working. It's great at washing off makeup - even my mascara. No scent, and gentle. Great product! This is wonder ful for washing my face and does the job really well espically when I wear make up. No drying out. Our dermatologist has everyone in the family using the Vanicream products. It's really helped minimize the children's eczema effects. We use the bar soap, shampoo, and sunscreen as well. Free & Clean Liquid  is an outstanding facial cleanser.  When  placing  the Free & Clean Liquid on your wet hands or body it  lathers well.I have recommended this product to my family members and friends. My husband and friends are using this product and they love it. Soap gets nice and foamy. this is better then we thought it would be. Works excellent, I have very sensitive skin, and my skin had been burned by vitamin E.  Please never but straight Vitamin E on your face. My face feels fresh every time I use this.  Not dry I love it I use this product twice a day and you don't give me any dry skin or break my skin out. I'm so happy the dermatologist recommend this product and the product exist I had to start using liquid cleanser due to eczema. I had been using a scented liquid cleanser that I loved and had to give it up. Free & Clear Liquid Cleanser is now cleanser of choice. You do not have to much. I plan on using this for a long time. Best night time face wash I've ever used. This is so lightweight and fragrance free and my skin loves it. Recommended by my dermatologist for hand eczema  followed by vanicream lotion. It's great! This product is the only one I have found that is gentle for my skin, yet cleans it good. When it shipped, some of the product leaked out into the packaging, but didn't get on my other products, which was good. No complaints otherwise. I have really sensitive skin and this cleanser not only cleans off all the makeup but does not irritate my skin either. My daughter has very sensitive skin, excema, and allergies. I have used this wash for years now, it is the only one that does not bother her. My other 2 daughters also use it and I use it as a facial cleaner. Great product to use on sensitive skin, no scent love it Can I say, I absolutely love this soap.  It is amazing.  Especially for someone with allergies and sensitive skin.  If you need something that you wont be allergic to or you do not want all the nasty chemicals, defiantly choose this one. I really like all of the Free and Clear products.  They do what they say they are going to do without any scent.  I am very sensitive to scents, particularly unnatural ones.  I recommend this product! I have severe eczema and going through TSW. LOVE this product it has never irritated my skin, I even use it during flares no problem. Great product Leaves my skin clean and there is no rash or itching after showering.  It's not harsh and does not leave my skin cracked and dried out. Nice, gentle soap! Great product for people with sensitive skin or those who like to use products without a lot extra ingredients. Nice cleanser.  Leaves my hands feeling nice The only non-irritating soap we can use on our child who battles eczema. This product is the only skin cleaner I can safely use. It works like charm! Love this cleanser! Not only does it remove everything, including ALL my eye makeup (even mascara) - it's gentle, doesn't sting, and suds up easily. This cleanser would be great for all skins. I have normal skin and just love it. I have used it w/ both my Clarisonic and now my Foreo Luna. I have very sensitive skin and my skin doctor recommended this. This is a great product. It works well with my sensitive skin. I love this cleanser.  I use it mostly on my face and it leaves my face clean, but doesn't dry out.  Thank you for the speech delivery. This product is gentle, yet cleans all make-up off with ease and no burning to eyes.Just a small amount cleans your whole face.I really like this cleanser Dr recommended some FREE AND CLEAR after having skin irritation problems from products in other brands. Working for us. Really good for sensitive skins. With sensitive skin, this liquid cleanser does not dry out the skin or leave a residue. It is a great alternative if you wish to leave soap additives out of your daily living. Only soap that does not break our toddler out in the winter. It's not very moisturizing but if you have normal to oily or acne prone skin you will appreciate its texture.  In a world full of over fragranced irritating body washes, this is one of the only options for sensitive skin. Recommended by my dermatologist after treatment for sun damage.  I had a severe case of contact dermatitis and this product help clear it up by not introducing chemicals that irritated the new skin. I need fragrance free soaps and shampoos and this one works nicely. Even Johnson and Johnson baby products were irritating our preemies' skin, so we made the switch. This cleanser is a good value, works well, doesn't dry out their skin and has caused no irritation. This is the only cleanser that doesn't break out my ultra sensitive skin. I'm so happy my dermatologist recommended it. Works great for sensitive skin! Love this product. This is the only thing that clears my son skin I like this and I'm not switching to anything else for a while. The liquid is so light it feels almost like water on your skin. This is exactly what I was looking for. It doesn't not dry out my skin and yet makes it feel clean.Would highly recommend! This cleanser is awesome. It is just a bit drying, so no need to use it twice a day. But, really cleans well. Great product for sentive skin. Cleans without all the harsh chemicals and dyes that cause skin issues. Especially great for children with eczema. Recommended by my daughter's allergist.  She has been using it for one month and we love it! I really enjoy this line of products. Love what it doesn't have in it! My daughter has many allergies and will get red rashes and hives from some cleansers.  This is very gentle and haven't had this problem with this product.  Have used it for several years now. easy on my sensitive skin. fragrance free Washes very clean without residue.  Just use the Vanicream moisturizer afterward an your skin will thank you. Seems to do well in cleaning my face. Will keep using. For anyone with allergies to commercial products, all Free & Clear products are a godsend. They work and they don't make me itch or break-out. What else can I say! I searched for a soap that would help with my daughters eczema and didn't have anything that could irritate her skin allergies more. This soap is perfect! It doesn't dry out or irritate her skin at all. It also lathers well and a little goes a long way. Everything met my expectations --from the product to the delivery. My husband has extremely sensitive skin and can't tolerate any fragrance in products that touch his skin. This soap is on his bathroom vanity and has helped his hands. Yes, it's more than your average hand soap but his comfort and healthy skin are worth the price. I used to use perricone, lancome and others. My dermatologist recommend me this product. At first I was  skeptical but once I use WOW is the word. It is wonderful buy it BUY it!! very natural clean, after this I only use moisturizer and that's it. so glad I got it shipped on time ,love product My husband and I both have sensitive skin.  This is great for frequent use without causing excessive dryness or irritation.  Love that it is refillable at a fairly reasonable price. I always use this product after I clean my make up with a makeup remover. My skin feels very soft and clean and I do not have to worry about my skin getting exposed by some BS chemicals. This stuff really seems to work!  At daycare my son was coming home with very dry patches on his hands due to all the washing.  But his skin has stayed soft with this soap after a week of washing. I buy this for my 87 year old mother, it's the only cleanser that does not irritate her eyes. She loves it. Good for sensitive skin. Really like this soap I love this cleanser! I use it on myself and on my 2 and 3 year old. It's so gentle but it still cleans. Perfect for sensitive skin and for eczema and psoriasis. VERY GOOD FOR EXTREMELY SENSITIVE SKIN, ESP. PEOPLE GOING THRU CHEMO OR WITH MEDICAL PROBLEMS great for my skin Love this product.  I have one bottle at home and one at the gym. The best product I have found for my sensitive skin. The only fragrance free cleanser that my dermatologist recommended. Great for sensitive skin and even not so sensitive. FINALLY something I'm not allergic to Nice ! Item is moslty used by my wife, she has very sensitive skin and it starts to crack if using regular washes, even some of the gentler ones. she has been using this for a while and finds that it is the best wash that she has used so far. If you have sensitive skin and need a cleanser that is mild then this is the one for you.  It was recommended by Dermotologist and it is great.  The price is great too! This is the only cleanser I've found that doesn't react with my son's skin, as he has mild eczema. this is a great option for kids who have sensitive skin, especially on their hands. No fragrance and no soapy mess left on hands if not rinsed completely. no fragrance and my skin is clean and soft, not tight. will purchase again.

I use it in the shower every morning on my face and my skin doesn't get red and stripped like with other face washes. It lathers just enough and rinses cleanly without any residue. I use the Vanicream Lite Lotion on my face after washing, and the Moisturizing Skin Cream at night. I'd recommend any of the Vanicream products for people with sensitive skin. As a chemically sensitive individual, this is the only soap on the market that my body tolerates. I would be ""dirty"" without it. It is a wonderful product! Great for sensitive skin!

I was recently told to avoid Parabens and Formaldehyde.  This product works great and is very light! Curology recommended this to me as some of the Neutrogena products I was using had ingredients in them that were likely contributing to my irritating plethora of closed comedones. This seems to be helping! I've been using it with a gentle exfoliating sponge to wash my face for over a month now and I'm finding I don't even have to moisturize as often, which I used to have to do at least 4 times a day as I have very dry skin. Great for people with allergies. Use it for my baby granddaughter. Works well on sensitive skin. I love this cleanser for my face. It cleanses the face and leaves it refreshed, not dry and dull looking. I've used this for several years now and it is very gentle on my face and doesn't cause me to have breakouts. Nice lather, washes off clean. And yes it is unscented but unlike some other products this is very pleasing to my nose. I am allergic to fragrance so this product really does the job and I love it. so hard to find fragrence free, unscented products.....this ticks the boxes on that one - I use it as hand soap and it works great Excellent for Rosacea, sensitive skin.

My son who has had blemish problems, gave up using name brand products and used this instead, and his skin is better than ever! Harsh is damaging to ALL skin types. This was recommended to me by a dermatologist I saw after I had a severe skin allergy. I've been using these products ever since. These may be a little more expensive than regular soaps, but for what you're getting, and even more important, for what you're NOT GETTING, they are very affordable. They last a long time and although they don't lather as well as a few reviewers have written, that doesn't make them bad, it actually means they're better! Lather occurs more frequently when a product is alkaline, which is not as good for skin. A Ph balanced product tends to lather less, but still cleans as well. This cleanser can even be used for babies and is recommended by many pediatricians and dermatologists. I have very very SUPER sensitive skin. I do not have any breakouts. My skin feels clean after use. If you like Vanicream products you will love this. Doesn't dry out my skin and does not have parabens, etc! Ask described.

I have acne prone skin. Also using Retin A. So I need an extremely gentle facial cleanser. Very gentle. My daughter with eczema also uses this as a body wash. Excellent non-scented soap. This product is great for sensitive facial skin.  It has no fragrance, does not burn, and a little goes a long way.

Leaves my skin fresh and smooth Dermatologist recommended for balsam of peru allergy"
B00J2MILYO," These are awesome at cleaning dirt and makeup off your face, since this is what they're made for I wouldn't normally even bother to review them, but when they effortlessly and most effectively removed the green acrylic paint I had gotten on my black leather cellphone case through the unforeseen danger of texting while painting a landscape, I just had to say these things are amazing! I love this product so much!!!! Now that its summer I need to stock up soon. These smell so good! And they really work well to clean up my oil skin. I keep them around me at all times so that when I feel my skin oiling up, I can grab one and fight back quickly. After cleaning with it, my skin stays feeling great for hours. It works really well for removing makeup too. I love the cheap price and everything from Burt's Bees is top quality. I thought that a small pack  of 30 wouldn't last long but I don't have to use them all the time, usually one a day unless I'm playing with makeup. I''ll definitely keep buying these in the future!One thing to note; I've had these burn my face a few times after using some other products. Maybe not the best idea for sensitive skin or after a facial routine. But there are other types of the same kind. I'll be getting another 'flavor' the next time as I feel like grapefruit can be acidic and I'd like something more neutral. These facial cleansing towelettes are perfect for the traveler. As a traveling ICU nurse I am always on the go. I am able to toss a package of these in my bag and take them wherever I go. Whether it be at an assignment for a few days, or even hiking, these burt's bees facial cleansing towelettes are incredible for making my face feel clean and fresh. I was hesitant at first to purchase something you don't rinse off, but these leave my face feeling clean and freshly washed. I would recommend these to anyone, whether you travel for a living or not. I use them every night before I go to bed as well! I use these everyday, I kept forgetting to get them at the store - which they are actually cheaper at Kroger. For now anyway, you know how that goes. I don't really like any other brand, they break me out, make me oily or just don't work. This is the holy grail. Before I started working as a beauty adviser I never knew that Burt's Bees had anything except chap-stick(which I love all of their chap-sticks). When I saw these face wipes I decided I would try them out. I am so glad that I did! I haven't changed face-wipes since. They take away the makeup and grease of the day and leave you with a clean feeling face and refreshing smell. Sometimes I even use these wipes if I'm just feeling icky after a long day(without even wearing makeup!). I always feel clean when I use these, and they take away the long process of using many different face washes and the possible chance of the wash getting into your hair. Quick, easy, and it works. I definitely suggest these. Smell great and do a good job at removing make up or quick cleansing. Didn't make me break out. These are awesome. Smell great and super convenient for cleaning up in the morning, removing makeup, or getting the salt off your face after surfing. I now have a lifetime supply of them. Thank you, Amazon. nice scent and leaves your face feeling clean. I recommend keeping the little sticker that covers the wipes in place between uses, will help prevent drying out of the wipes. I love these towelettes! I bought them specifically to use after my workouts as I don't like to shower at the gym, I'll wait until I get home. But I wanted something that would target my problem areas until I got home to shower. I used to have a tendency to break out due to sweat from my workouts - my chest, in between my shoulder blades, and...my butt. I've tried other cleansing towelettes, even more harsh ones targeted for acne like Clean & Clear, and these Burt's Bees towelettes work like a dream, it's amazing! I have been using these now after every workout (3-4 times a week) and haven't had any break outs. Plus, they smell AMAZING! These are great little towelettes and perfect for the morning time when I want to freshen up my face before cosmetics. I'm not so sure it works well at removing mascara,etc...but I use a separate cleanser for that and mainly these only when I just need a refresher. They have a nice clean crisp scent but not too heavy as I am sensitive to strong smells. If you wake up in the morning in a dry desert or mountain climate, these things work like bandits at clearing your eyes, and just plain waking you up. No need for coffee. Fabulous scent, non oily, and dry rapidly. Highly recommended. I swear I can hear the skin/pores on my face sigh with pleasure after using these wipes at the end of the day. Very nice fragrance. Will buy again. I first tried hurts bees towelettes via a sample from the Walmart beauty box. I instantly fell in love with them. This is the first time I have tried the cucumber scented ones, and I love them! They make my face feel clean and fresh and cool as a cucumber. I highly recommend! I like this product.  I use it daily before putting on moisturizer.  I smells clean and fresh and it doesn't irritate my skin. I really love these facial wipes. They do not have harsh chemicals that leave your skin feeling dry and funny smelling after using them. They smell great and work really well on my skin. Previous reviewers have mentioned they do not remove makeup, but that really depends on what is on your face. They remove all of my eyeshadow perfectly. The only thing I have ever had trouble with is eyeliner, but I buy eyeliner that prides itself on not going anywhere -- so I have a special remover for it. Also, I like being able to buy them in the 4-pack because it saves you some money. I would recommend you give them a try, especially if you're looking for something a little more natural. Use these all the time... can be strong, so if you have sensitive skin but want a quick easy to remove makeup, give a quick rinse and use a food-grade oil to remove stubborn eye makeup... wipe off with towelette at end. Works for me! This is a great product.  I have no problem recommending this to my family, friends and consumers. This would make a perfect gift. I am very satisfied.I would also highly recommend this seller. The product was of high quality and just as described. My package came fast, and undamaged. The product was well protected and arrived in perfect condition. I absolutely adore these wipes.  They are soothing to the skin and smell like a high-end spa.  I give them my highest recommendation. I love these towelettes.  They feel so good and fresh on my skin..  I have very sensitive skin and can't use a lot of products, ;but these are perfect. These are the only ones I've found that work well for me. Cucumber and sage is fresh, and works, unlike their one for sensitive skin. It stings a bit, but doesn't anymore now that my skin is used to it Great product with good scent.  Use for my tween son to get him in the habit  of daily face washing I've used easily 10-12 different brands/scents/varieties of facial cleansing wipes and these are my hands-down favorite.  Just the right amount of moisture, very clean and pleasant smell.  Face feels wonderful and fresh. These smell amazing and they make you fell fresh after using them. I'm very pleased with them and out of all the towelettes I've used over the years these hands down are my favorite. They don't leave you face greasy either. I take them everywhere with me. These are really thick and take off eye makeup easily. I like the scent of this one too. I buy these often and always like to have them on hand. They leave a refreshing scent and are durable wipes. I use them to wipe makeup off at night. They don't leave a soapy residue on my face either. If you have oily skin with bumps or blackheads or whiteheads that show up on your face, try these towelettes.  They remedy the oiliness and the bumps dry up.  I use them morning and nighttime to help keep my complexion clear. I am in love with this product!!!  I have severe allergies and sensitivities to smells and products, so I have to buy unscented everything.  I took a chance with the Pink Grapefruit scent and I'm so glad that I did!  The scent is very mild and pleasant and doesn't linger forever like some artificial scents do.  I use them every night and some days when the Southern California heat makes me feel yucky but I don't have time for a shower before running out of the house!  Burt's Bees Facial Cleansing Towelettes, Pink Grapefruit, 30 Count, is now my favorite Amazon add-on item!!! I spent a lot of time trying to find a cleansing towelette that does not make me break out and that I could use anytime without rinsing.  These towelettes  removes dirt and oil without leaving your skin irritated or red.  I've always love Burt's bees for their natural products so I was happy to find these online.  The best part of these cleansing wipes is that it does not make me break out, its really good on sensitive skin and leaves your face feeling nice as well,  I would definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for a quick makeup removal that is not harsh on sensitive skin. I'm not much for washing my face, but I love doing it with these? They make my face and neck feel so clean and refreshed! I will definitely be buying more! Iv'e been using these for a few years and I love them for removing my eye make-up. Can't say how they would do on an entire face but for eye make-up removal these are wonderful. Cool, refreshing with a nice subtle sweet scent.  I use them after working out during the day These are my new best friend while traveling. Good size packaging...although I hate to use disposable products. It's an awesome refresher after a long flight. These are gentle on my face with a gentle smell.  The ease of use cannot be any easier, no water needed, no mirror needed,  I use my in bed just before I go to sleep because I keep them in my nightstand with my night cream. GreAt products.  I love Burts Bees stuff and these do a great job of cleaning your face.  You can throw some in your purse, far or at work.  Anywhere you feel you might need a quick freshening up. My skin is sensitive and this works!  It also has a nice fragrance. I absolutely love Burt's Bees products.  Natural and wonderful. Love burts bees products & grapefruit products tend to agree with my sensitive oily skin the best with no breakouts or rashes. These wipes are great for using after a shower and for taking off all of my makeup when I get home at night. It also has a nice light & pleasant grapefruit scent that doesn't linger. No complaints and I use them to wipe the sweat from my forehead. Great cleaning with no irritation.  Nice scent too. Refreshing on the face and effective for removing make-up. Feels super nice on my skin, burts is my life Good Deal.Price and quality are great. Cleans the face very well and gentle to the skin. My skin is really sensitive and dry. Water irritates it and because of this I haven't been able to wash my face with normal face washes and most products I find for sensitive skin have a drying ingredient that makes my skin rough and scaly and red. These wipes don't have that ingridiant (or it's a very minor one) and they are PERFECT for all of my problems! They make my skin so smooth and hydrated while also washing and a huge bonus that I don't have to use water. Surprisingly refreshing and cleansing. first time buying the product.  I really like them. Very soft and gentle enough to use on my face without problems. Not overly wet. The cucumber fragrance is great, light and fresh The smell felt overwhelming at first but the more I use them the more refreshing I find it :) Should be called blackheads! begone! use them every night. great product and gentle on my skin I love these wipes for a refreshing quick clean after getting sweaty.  The grapefruit smell is great!  Not sticky feeling.  Can't comment on make-up removal because I don't wear make-up. OMG the smell. Cleans great as well love these for my face Tried many different makes.  Burts is the best  Aroma, cleaning ability,  quality of wipe  Try grapefruit love the way these smell and feel Love the way this feels especially in warm weather.! I don't use these all the time, but they make a nice, gentle cleanser for your face when you want to change up from other cleansing. I'll use them before I go to bed at night when I don't feel like going through a ""getting ready for bed"" routine. They smell fresh, are gentle, & I'll probably buy again in the future. They'd be especially nice for travel. Good product! I really like these cleansing cloths.  Bought three packages to share with my two daughters.  I will be ordering more. Great scent! Burt's Bee is the best like the feel afterwards These are great cleaning cloth, especially if you have sensitive skin. I love Burt's Bees products and have never been disappointed. Fragrance is refreshing and product is not drying.  Very happy with it. Bought these for the cucumber scent although the sage scent wins out. Still I like the towelettes, quick and clean on the road. I love these.  Not drying.  Worked well on trip in a very hot climate.  Have already re-ordered for home use. Love this product! great products Perfect for lazy people on the go. I can just clean my face when it feels oily. It's wonderful. I love the big package too as I go through them pretty fast. I also don't like to put lots of chemicals on my face. This feels good on my face and I feel OK putting this by my eyes/mouth/ears. It also smells good and fresh but not overpowering which I really like. I love that after a long day I don't need to dunk my face underwater and can just take off my makeup with minimum effort. and they smell good. Just as described. Arrived on time and had no damage. These smell amazing!!! I only use then when I am too lazy to wash my face the old fashioned way.  They work great. Has a very pleasant though mild scent!  It's also gentle on my sensitive skin. I have extremely sensitive skin and these are my go-to. Use them every night before bed and they don't make me breakout like other brands. do a great job and love the peach scent MY WIFE LOVES THEM Easy on the face when wash clothes are to harsh. Removes all makeup including mascara, which I rarely wear. Smell so good! Really feel cleansed afterwards. My husband even likes them. Love the company so I knew these would be great Very refreshing Love these face towels. I'm a guy and I use one of these every night before I go to bed instead of washing my face and my skin hasn't been clearer. I use to wash my face every night and it kept my skin fairly clear but from time to time I would get a small breakout on my forehead. I've had these on auto renewal from Amazon for about 5 months now and I haven't had a breakout yet. Just grab a wipe, clean you face in less than a minute and then throw it away. Done and done. I have dry skin so need to remove make up AND exfoliate at the end of the day. These wipes remove the dead skin on the surface as well as my make up. My skin is sensitive,  so it can tingle a bit when I'm done,  but not uncomfortable.  Great scent. I can always tell that these work.  They smell great and doesn't cause any outbreak on my face.  Really great for removing makeup as well.  I recommend them to all my friends. I love Burt's Bees and these wipes are no exception. They got all my makeup off in one go (even my stubborn eye makeup) and didn't aggravate my sensitive skin. The scent was grapefruit-y but not overwhelming. I wholeheartedly recommend them! I have an oily face and it seems to collect a lot of dirt. These wipes do a good job of cleaning it and doesn't leave my face dry. They feel so good on my face. These are great. I have super sensitive skin and these have never irritated it. Im also very conscience of the ingredients of products i apply to my skin. These contain nothing harmful. They removed dirt oil and make up very easily without being too harsh or over drying. I use them every day and have no complaints. Love all the Burt's Bees products; these are no exception and better price than the drug store! Love these for when I'm too lazy to wash my face (which isn't often). I do use these when I feel like I still have makeup residue on my face after washing it. The scent is very pleasant. I have super oily skin and these definitely help. smells good and very soft tissues These smell and feel wonderful! Love this as it is fresh and very refreshing for a quick face wash day or night and cleans off make-up great This is my favorite face wipe.  I love the cool cucumber scent. LOVE these wipes! These work well, the smell can be strong at first but I've gotten use to it. I tried switching to something else and it did not work near as well, so I'm going to keep buying this! Nice feel in skin. Great, subtle fragrance. On par with other Burt's Bees products, these are fantastic. I bought some of these for my wife as a make up remover or morning face cleaner and she loved them! So I was delighted to find them on Amazon for much cheaper than normal stores.I bought a whole bunch and now we use them for everything. I keep a pack in my camping stuff stuff and some with my off road vehicles for getting the dust off your face after enjoying the out doors. You could just use baby wipes but in my opinion these feel much better afterward. So refreshing! Perfect for that occasion, you don't have time to shower, when you're out and about, as well! Highly recommend. Perfect and refreshing, also takes off makeup which is a plus! Very good seller, product shipped fast and arrived as intended. The product itself is superb. I immediately noticed that it did not have the chemically/alcohol overtone of similar products, and was more pleasant to use because of this fact. The pink grapefruit smell is subtle, sweet, and not overpowering. The wipes wipe cleanly, but I noticed that they leave some waxy residue which acts as a vector for scent. This product is super and I would buy again The smell is a little abrasive but these wipes are the only thing that keep my acne at bay. My favorite facial wipe.  I have horribly sensitive skin and these wipes are very mild. love these I use these all the time. Allll the time. Smells great. Removes makeup well. Doesn't irritate my skin and hasn't caused any issues. Love them. Burt's Bees Facial Cleansers are the best. Especially loved the cucumber :) I have been using these for years and always get the 2 pack from Amazon for a great price. These are clean and moist. I keep these handy to wipe my face morning and night. They are not drying or irritating in any way. They easily remove makeup including mascara. I don't know what I would do without these little wipes! Cleanses my face well and removes makeup without being harsh on the skin. The cucumber and sage scent is refreshing and the wipes leave my face feeling clean but not dried out. Burt's Bees is generally my go-to ever since I've tried staying away from products with chemicals. I love the scents and that it is better for your skin. These towelettes are great for bringing with you on the go or even for a quick face wash at home. These take off any dirt / make up on my skin while saving time. Love the scent as well! It is the first time I am using this product and I love it, it is so soft, it feels great on the skin, it is well moist and the size is perfect for the handling. I love the package because it keeps them moist for a long time.........and...........wow!!!!....the grapefruit scent is wonderful, refreshing and even therapeutic.....excellent product!!! Soothing. I bought these to use in Afghanistan as running water isn't always available. I use them every morning as I can't wash my face. I started using the Garnier ones which were OK, but these are far better. I feel like my face is cleaner and you can visibly see more dirt come off onto the towel.  They leave your face very clean (no residue) and they smell really nice - much better than the Garnier wipes. I'm going to start using these ones at night even when I get home because they make my face feel so nice and clean. Also, the towels themselves are very soft.100% recommend them. I have bought other Burt's Bees products in the past, mostly the chapstick, but this was the first time buying face wipes, and I have to say, I love the way these make my face feel! So fresh and tingly! They smell like grapefruit, too. No chemical smell, like some other face wipes. love it Love these wipes! I live and work in a very humid climate, so I carry these around everywhere to freshen up. They make my skin feel cool and fresh. Love these guys.  I take them with me whenever I travel - especially on long work trips - and use one each day when I get home from work.  Cleans off my (waterproof) makeup, doesn't irritate my skin with frequent use.  I do wish that perhaps the packaging was a touch better, but I feel this way about everything in these little resealable packets. The grapefruit has a bright and sweet aroma.  The towelette is easy on my skin and stayed moist unlike other brands I have used.  I cleansed off the makeup and dirt and used both sides of the towelette.  It held up nicely.  Overall a great quality product and good value. Wife likes better than higher priced other brand wipes I've used just about every facial cleansing wipe on the market. These are my favorite! I keep some in my gym bag, some in my desk at work and of course a stash in my bathroom.  I use them everyday to remove makeup, cleanse after the gym or freshen up before a night out. The scent isn't strong but if you're looking for no fragrance try the sensitive skin version. No water needed, quick and effective.  Amazon has the best price I've found. Target and Walmart usually have a single 30 pack for $5.99. These are very moist and the grapefruit scent is so good! Great for removing makeup but too harsh to use in the eye area. Bought these for a two week camping trip initially and now I want them all the time, every day or whenever I want! Great for aroma therapy.....was able to cure my friend's migraine by having her put towel over her head and breathe deeply. Different scents are available and good pricing available on amazon. Love it...works well, and smells great. Refreshing and effective, lovely aroma, and easy to use. I was looking for an all natural makeup remover and came across these!  I love them!  I've only used the Pink Grapefruit, but will probably try them all.  Great product! Awesome & didn't break me out which is amazing!! Love them! I am 38 years old and STILL fight oily skin. Especially in the summer time!! I love these. They do decrease the amount of oils, smell wonderful and DO NOT irritate my sensitive skin! I will buy these forever. Not only is the smell heavenly, but it's the best make up removing cloth I've used. Lovely scent and gentle cleansing I love this exfoliating wipes.  I use one a night to take a full body wash which is awesome.  I go to bed feeling clean every night. I like them. both my husband and I use the wipes daily. Clean scent and takes almost all my makeup off - leaves on mascara unless you scrub, but that takes my eyelashes out. Great natural cleansing cloth for a quick clean up These are one of the best facial cleansing cloths i ever used. They are non irritating and clean off make up and dirt very well. They have a great fragrance and leave the skin feeling very clean and refreshed. These face wipes are a really nice size, the largest and best feeling on my skin that I've ever used. I've tried four or five of the others. Removes all makeup including waterproof mascara. Definitely the best value I've found and will continue to buy. These are quick and easy after the gym! Do you put off washing and moisturizing your face just before you go to bed?  I do.  If so, these are wonderful.  I keep these, along with a jar of my favorite moisturizer right by my bed so that when I am so sleepy I don't want to traipse the 10 steps to the bathroom I can sit in bed, thoroughly cleanse my face with these gentle cleansing towelettes and apply my moisturizer.  All done in two minutes! These are so convenient to use before bed. I don't want to splash my face with water and wake myself up, so I use these. They don't irritate my skin and they smell great. After I'm done, I use the Burt's Bees night cream. Also, they save water so if you have a water bill (I don't), that's a nice bonus. I love these. Grapefruit is naturally antibacterial and I don't know if these contain enough of it for it be the reason, but my skin looked great after I started using them. I never think these kind of towelettes get all your makeup off, but for a quick job or a refresh in the morning, they're invaluable. And I love the scent. Plus the price is great. Smell so good! I have sensitive skin, and no problems. Great purchase, which arrived fast! My new favorite beauty product. I used to love the Neutrogena pink grapefruit but they don't make them anymore so I happened to stumble upon these on Amazon. The same fresh smell and feel and they don't break me up (plus I trust Burt's Bees more than Neutrogena). Suffice to say they're on my Subscribe&Save now. These are the best cleansing towelettes I've used by far.  They are worth the extra money.  Effective, no stinging around the eyes, and they smell great.  Highly recommend. I use these every day to remove my makeup and I'm a big fan.  Very nice, light scent and my sensitive skin seems to react well to them. Really really like these towelettes! They work great and have a pleasing smell. Stay nice and moist in the package. Very nice wipes. They're thick and smell like yummy grapefruit! They do a nice job removing mild makeup too, although I haven't tried them for the heavy performance set. These are my go to face wipes, the grapefruit smell is super refreshing I've tried a lot of cleansing remover & none has done the job better than Burt's! I so happy I stumble upon this and decide to give it a try. I was worried about it drying out my skin but it doesn't! My personal preference is the grapefruit! Great I love these and use them nightly before bed and use then when I wake up.  They smell amazing, like u are applying fresh juice to your face.  I have tried other brands but they have an artificial smell to them.  These by far are superior to other grapefruit wipes and clean my face well. Smell great and do the job. There are also more tissues in there than usual which is a plus. A few wipes and all the makeup is of my face, even mascara and eye liner come of pretty easy, without having to rub hard. Would buy again. Love anything BB's! These are nice smelling, take off all my makeup including eye. Refreshing scent, large cloth can wipe face, neck, and all missed cervices at least twice, and still feel like i am wasting entire cloth. Skin very clean after wiping, and looking healthy! So convenient.  I travel a lot.  These wipes keep my face clean and free of grease.  I made the mistake of not carrying with me one day when traveling and broke out from the dirt on my face.  I won't leave them behind again.  The wipes are easy to use, don't have a funky odor, and actually cleans without leaving any residue.  All natural wipes.  Nice and quick to use. Very gentle on my sensitive skin. good I buy these things religiously. I like the fact they are Burt's for several reasons. Mostly cruelty free being at the top. This does well for me as my skin is oily even into my thirties. Also they smell awesome! The best thing about these wipes is the smell, theres this fresh citrus scent to them which is perfect after a hard days work. They clean awesome, and theyre very sturdy and thick as well. I actually have very oily skin, and I read in a Mary Kay book that white tea helps with the absorbtion of it, and its totally true! Would reccomend for gals who dont have time to wash their face at night and those with oily skin. Btw tried some from ""say yes to tomato"", they sucked!!! Slightly burning effect on my eyes.. Work great! Even if these didn't work, which they do, I would order them just for the fragrance.  I like to use them when camping because of the convenience.  Also keeping them in the auto for a quick refresher. I use these because, well, I'm just too friggin' lazy to wash my face every night.  I always end up getting soap in my eyes when I'm taking off make-up late at night, and this cleansing wipe does the job without causing any eye injuries to my tired self, which I apprecaite.  I buy it in the double packs and would recommend it to anyone, especially those of us who need a regular face washing routine at night due to make-up, dirt, etc., or to those of us who travel. My wife loves this product. I love Burt Bees facial wipes. I chose the grapefruit ones this time because I heard grapefruit is amazing for your skin. I didn't really notice a significant difference, but they still did their job! This is one of my must-haves now. I have oily skin and whenever I use these wipes after a long day of constant on-the-go make-up wearing grossness, it leaves my skin feeling so refreshed and wonderful again. Not to mention, the scent is amazing. :) This is now in my permanent arsenal of beauty supplies! My whole family loves these. They feel like they clean you better than regular wipes because of the texture. Great for sleepovers, camping, to get behind your ears at night, or just if you're feeling lazy. Great deal too: a few dollars more in the store! Absolutely love these! Peach is a wonderful toner for skin, the material is not too abrasive, and even with fairly sensitive skin, these don't irritate my face at all. Plus they have a wonderful peachy scent.They are also capable of removing eye makeup (not sure about mascara since I don't wear it, but they work on waterproof eyeliner perfectly, without irritating my eyes).I follow up with calendula oil,  which is wonderful for most any skin care needs (cuts, uneven skin tone, dryness, rashes, etc - I even use the oil for razor burn and other skin maladies) These work better than any of the dozens of other brands I've tried. Much thicker and they smell amazing. smell is really nice.  face doesnt feel dried out after use.  does a good job, even removing makeup. Love it Gentle to my face. I always wondered what the big rage was with everyone out buying Burts Bees.  Now I know what the fuss is all about.  First of all the smell is a very light lemony smell with just the right amount of moisture to keep your skiing feeling fresh and clean. Lovely scent, incredibly convenient, and hasn't made me break out. It's probably one of my favorite parts of getting ready for bed, which sounds really strange. Try them! Your skin will feel very refreshed and clean. Just be sure to moisturize after.I use subscribe & save through Amazon Mom which is really nice. Every other month, two packs show up on my doorstep. I use 1/day and there's 30 wipes so it's pretty much perfect. The best facial wipes I've ever used. Smells great, natural ingredients, and I add a little jojoba oil so it's easier to remove make up. I buy these monthly. I really like this product. I use them twice a day on my face. They make my face so nice and soft. Nice smell too. My granddaughter had the cucumber one and she didn't care for the smell. But she uses the other scents says she thinks it helps a bit with her acne too. Love these! I use them to take off my make-up every evening. Works even on waterproof eye liner! Cleans well, smells fresh. What's not to like. these are the best! the scent is my favorite part. I am a fan of all things burts bees, but these wipes might be my favorite! I love these wipes.  They are great for the beach, my travel bag and my skin!!  These are definitely my new favorite Burt Bee's product.They smell great whats not to like. I have very sensitive skin and I try to keep to all natural products. I've even tried other natural wipes that make my face burn no matter how ""sensitive"" they are. These clean really well and don't cause skin irritation! Even took off all the grease face paint from Halloween! I've always loved these. Incredible smell. Nice thick texture. Very efficient for the occasions when I can't wash my face with soap. Burt's Bees...sometimes pricey but I love them so.  Burt's Bees leaves my face feeling fresh without feeling like I have lost a layer of skin.  My only issue is that they come pre-moistened, I live in desert country and they dry out fast (add some water and you're OK again, though).  I really like the wipes I can wet myself so I don't have to worry about drying out, or if I want them hot or cold. smells good, works well, very pleased :) Best facial cleansing I ever used it makes my face feel young again It smooths it out and makes it better again I will recommend to friend or family  member love this product will buy again Love these, buy them all the time as I hate cleaning my face at night and these handle that job beautifully. I have sensitive skin and never break out with their products either. I dislike a ""splashed-on"" sink.  The towelettes are doing fine with my old skin and they don't mess up the sink.  I also enjoy a slight fragrance.  The Pink Grapefruit towelettes are delightful also.  I often use them first thing in the morning too. I've used these for a few days now. The scent is lovely and they're quite refreshing. Great at removing mascara. I mostly use these when I am traveling so that I don't leave eye makeup on washcloths at friends' and families' homes. The smell is refreshing and does the trick of both cleaning and moisturizing without having to tote along multiple product. At home I'll pull them out when I feel lazy and don't want to my full skin care routine of cleansing, eye make up removal, and night moisturizer. Good product, cleans well, smells nice. Good for those days when you need to wash your face but don't have time/can't be bothered! I love the way y face feel after I use the wipe. I feel clean and fresh. These towelettes are really nice - they don't have an overly perfumey smell (they do have a sent but it is very mild and must be natural as it doesn't give me the ""cheap avon artificial scent headaches"" that I often get from scented products).They also are not greasy feeling at all. When you use them they readily remove your make-up (or dirt/food - I sometimes use them on my little girl who loves to be messy) and they don't leave a gross feeling residue on your skin. They also don't dry you out - I can use one on my face and I do not have to reapply moisturizer.Of course, in a pinch they can be used for any other ""wiping"" need, which makes them quite handy when traveling. The most refreshing facial cleansing towelette I've used.  Removes my make up and leaves my face feeling refreshed and clean. I love these.  Normally I would smear Noxzema all over my face and wipe it off with a Kleenex. This saves me a step, cleans better than the Noxzema and leaves my face feeling fresh. I think it's environmentally sound as the Kleenex and BB tissue are equally ""wasteful."" I love these. I use them every night and I've seen a significant reduction in my acne. However, I do rinse my face after using them so I can't say what will happen if you use them as directed (without rinsing). excellent. These towellets do a great job for removing make up. I have sensitive skin and these do not irritate.The scent is lovely but not too overpowering.After I cleanse my face with the towelette, I like to wash it out with cold water and then use it to rinse my skin from any residue. It's very refreshing. I have sensitive combination skin, and generally my face gets irritated with wipes/towelettes. However, this wipes are amazing! They refresh my skin, remove all my makeup, and smell delicious. These remove my make-up easily, smell great and don't leave an oily residue on my face. LOVE them! I keep a stash in a work drawer for freshening, and I keep them at the house for makeup removal before bed. My skin is left clean and soft. Love them! I really enjoy these. They take off my makeup very well and smell delicious. I notice an improvement in my skin using these regularly. These cloths smell heavenly. They are perfect for cleaning your face at the end of an evening. Or when you just don't have time for a proper wash. These are quick and get the job done. All makeup is removed and you are ready for bed in no time at all."
B000GDA06A," A really clean feel. Very Good Great product and it works wonderful for your skin. Great product and great price. I love this cleanser. My face feels so clean but not over drying. Everything as stated! love the smell and a great skin cleaner for aging skin Murad Cleanser it a great face washing product.  It really cleans your face without drying it out.  It leaves your face feeling nice and soft. no complaints, great product I bought this about a month ago and am going to be repurchasing soon. This face cleanser is amazing. for the past 3 years I've been dealing with breakouts. Not bad breakouts, but no matter what I would always have at least one pimple at all time and for me it was very frustrating to never have completely clear skin! After using this wash for only a week I noticed a huge difference. My skin is completely clear and I could not be happier. This wash is not harsh at all but cleans your skin so well without stripping your pores. My skin never feels tight from using this. I've also noticed a brighter, more even complexion. I'm obsessed!! I look forward to waking up and washing my face because of the citrus scent! Love Genuine product- Compared side by side with product purchased from Sephora and looks/feels identical.  Has helped even skin tone over time. Great cleanser. I use this over the summer and it makes my skin feel fresh and clean. I love almost everything Murad for my sensitive skin. Great product -- high quality ingredients. I love this product, I use it since it came out in the Market is excellent ! All was exactly as advertised, product and delivery :-) Listen, everything breaks me out - all the common drugstore brands destroys my face.I found this like 2 years ago and have not stopped using it. It does the job without drying out my face or causing breakouts. This is one of those stables. I have tried to use other EXPENSIVE things in between and have had to run right back.It gets off hat environmental dust and make up for sure. I like how my face feels after the wash and the smell is slightly citrusy which typically I dont like products with scent but this is A- OK.I even got travel sizes so I am never without it. This vitamin C line by Murad has to be the best line they carry.  It refreshes my face and gives me a glow.  It's best used with the vitamin c day spf cream and the night moisturizer. My daughter recommended this product and it work great. It does not dry out my skin like most face cleansers do. great skin cleanser  murad does a great job with skin carefast delivery  love this product My order arrived in one day!!!  I love this product line, really restores your skin's youthful glow.  I have tried many products; Murad essential c line beats them all hands down, at least for me. I love this cleanser and saved myself over $10.00 by buying it on Amazon.  It is a great water soluble cleanser that easily removes make up and leaves the skin soft! Great and arrived perfectly. this is the only facial cleanser I will use.  Does not irritate my sensitive skin! Really like the citrus smell! Also cruelty free (no animal testing) yay! Works well and doesn't cause me to break out. use this daily, great for cleansing my skin and no negative reactions! Yes love this product...... good for deep cleaner face This is an amazing cleanser. It does not leave your skin feeling dry! I use this face wash everyday!  It is brightening and won't dry out my skin.  I have oily skin and Murad products are one of my best discoveries! The best on the market. It really gets my face clean. Good price plus I like the product I really, really like this facial cleanser.  It's very gentle on the skin and has a nice smell to it.  It leaves my skin feeling clean and not too dry, as I have chronically dry skin.  I use this in combination with the Essential C moisturizer and it makes my face look amazing! This product really works and I love it. I will buy it again. Best cleanser on the market and smells amazing! The wife orders most of this Murad stuff pretty regularly - she loves it and Amazon offering it with prime shipping is just an added bonus! Murad is one of the leading brands when it comes to cleaners.  This product proved to work as it said it would.  The product gave me the moisture I needed. I have been using the Environmental Sheild Cleanser for about 4 years now. Over the past 20 years I have tried almost all of the Murad products.  I have very sensitive skin and this cleanser works best for me. I have combination skin that breaks out at times. I need to moisturize my cheeks while using powder to ""sop"" up the oil in my T zone. This not only makes my skin tone more even it helps with breakouts. I noticed a difference the very first time I used it.  My skin glows and looks amazing after I wash it.  This works better for me on break outs then the Murad line for acne which is too strong for my skin.  Amazon is the best place for pricing on this product and all Murad products.  Even if you are a Murad member and get their regular discount it is still cheaper to buy on Amazon. A perfect Murad moisturizer is Hydro-Dynamic Ultimate Moisture.  You only need to apply in the morning and it last all day and through the night.  I've never had a cream work so well. I'm 46 and not a single wrinkle. knock on wood. Great product for daily cleansing without drying skin. Love Murad products!Product packaged securely, shipped/received as expected. I trust this brand! Love this product! I absolutely love this cleanser. ..I have tried many but this one does it for me. It is gentle yet cleanses my skin really well. Brightens and smooths the skin very nice I have been using Murad's Vitamin C Cleanser for years and still can't find another face cleanser that even compares. It's great for washing off eye makeup without stinging your eyes. I find this so valuable in a face cleanser. There are so many products that burn or leave residue. Not Murad! There is NO residue...just squeeky clean skin. A little bit goes a long way. I buy it here because it costs $12 less than the beauty supply stores. I have sensitive skin too and this cleanser have never cause any irritation. I would recommend this to anyone that wants clean and fresh skin. Feels good on my skin and keeps away acne. Love this cleanser.  Smells good and not harsh. I use this with the night and day moisturizer. I have seen a difference in my skin within a week. Love this product My husband loves this, doesn't dry his skin out. I use this in the morning and it keeps my skin clean and fresh! Love the smell of it too! I use Murad products for all my face and acne needs.  I use this face wash every morning and my face is nice and clean without any residue.  Love it. Love this cleanser! Makes my skin feel clean and refreshed. Seller shipped right away and the product was at my door in 2 days. love it I love this product! Great for all skin types and isn't harsh on skin Best facial cleaner i've ever used. it feels clean and fresh, doesn't leave any residue and you don't need to use much to thouroghly clean your face and neck. Great product I love Murad products.  Keeps my skin clear without staining towels :) Great cleanser for my sensitive skin! I actually noticed an improvement after less than one week of use, first time I've seen that from a cleanser. My favorite cleanser! Great product! Super fast shipping, absolutely love it Received item as described and very quick. Highly recommended. I've been using Murad products for about 3 years and love the results.  The Vitamin C series has a lovely fresh citrus scent.  My face always feels great after using this mild cleanser. Love the Murad products. Face feels so clean and fresh. I am a big fan of Murads facial products. I have noticed improvement in my skin since using this for the last 2 years. I always get compliments on my skin as well. Does not irritate my sensitive older skin. Better results than anything I've tried. Excellent facial cleanser This cleanser has helped clear up my skin. Before this I was breaking out at least 4-5 times a month. I'm in my 30's so my skin has matured, but I still would break out until this. It doesn't dry out my skin and removes my makeup well. I do have to sometimes go over with makeup remover for my mascara but that's not a problem. I very happy with this cleanser. I've used this product for about a year and have noticed an improvement in the overall appearance of my skin. Great product!! I use this along with the serum realy helped clear and even my skin tone This is my second time buying this product and just love it.  It leaves my face feeling really clean and soft. I have bought this product 3 or 4 times already. I use it every morning and love it! I replace other face wash with this one. I use this every day and absolutely love it! All of the Murad products i have tried are spectacular. I usually use Murad's acne cleanser, but needed something more gentle for the mornings. Very happy with this, gentle and smells wonderful. Love this product!! Would recommend to anyone and I've used a lot of expensive and a lot of inexpensive products. excellent product and excellent service!! good product for aging skin Feels clean, fresh, and great for my oily skin I absolutely LOVE this Cleanser and the whole entire line. I am a mixed black, white, and indian woman with a medium skin tone and when I tell you I had severe hyperpigmentation - it was SEVERE, I had to use full coverage foundation and tried everything you can possibly think of to clear it. Eventually I went to MassageEnvy and received a facial, my face looked amazing because they use these products. I purchased this cleanser and fell in love and eventually went to buy the whole entire kit. My face has NEVER looked and felt this good, I even use the PEEL.  If you have had an occasional breakout that ALWAYS leaves a mark, have hyperpigmentation/scars you've had for a long time, have no fear...Murad is here! I don't even have to leave the house with an ounce of makeup anymore with continued use of about 2 months. It's pricey for everything, but extremely worth it. Good stuff.  Arrived quickly, product as described. I love this stuff Great for my sensitive skin. Non irritating and softening. It worked quite well. my face felt and was very clean after washing with it. it works well especially for matured skin. I started using this product about a month ago along with a vitamin C serum and the Murad vitamin C moisturizer with spf 30 as a daily skin regime. I can honestly say my skin has never looked & felt better. I also use a sensitive skin enzyme mask 3x a week for added exfoliation. My blemishes are fading and my face looks brighter & glowing. Staying away from the sun really helps with preventing aging & wrinkles but when you do get exposed to the mother of all energy, vitamin C is the way to help with problems that are caused from it such as hyperpigmentation, which I deal with from time to time being a dark skinned filipino.  I recommend this to anyone looking to benefit their appearance from excessive sun exposure. It's smells great as well which is always a plus! Product works good. Not expensive. Murad products are good. I was surprised. Leaves you squeaky clean without drying out your skin. Helped clear my acne. Love this product for my sensitive combination skin! Love this stuf I use this every day morning and night. My skin feels clean  soft. The smell is very pleasant too. I am sticking with it. Excellent Nice scent and non drying I have tried many face washes for my acne and this is the best I have tried. The scent is not overwhelming and it gets the job done. Live this product. Great price This is a very good facial cleanser.  It leaves your face feeling very clean but not dried out.  A little expensive but worth it.  Murad products are great. Love Murad, great price!! Love this product! love the way it washes w/out stripping skin My wife loves this product and it keeps her looking young and fresh.  Great for those outdoors a lot. . Excellent product!  I have trouble finding this product at local beauty stores.  They don't seem to do a good job with stocking this product I've used tons of other cleansers...Clinique, Lancôme, Origins, Neutrogena, etc. This is the best cleanser I have ever used. It keeps my normal to oily skin clean and clear without irritation or drying it out. Highly recommended. I received the product using Prime. It was curious  that the order was filled by HBC Depot which is not even on the list of sellers. That said, it was sealed and shrink wrapped in a Murad box. It does appear to be the real product and not a fake. This is the only product I want to use on my face and it isn't dry anymore. It will last a long time because you only need a small amount. June 25, 2015  This size lasted me a year! I just reordered today. I cannot see myself not using this to wash my face with this in the morning. I have been looking for a cleanser that makes my skin feel clean but not dry. This cleanser is what I have been looking for. Will buy again. I love this product. It really makes a difference for my skin - leaves it glowing. A key part of my skin care routine, other cleansers don't compare. My skin and very dry and sensitive.  My skin feels clean and refreshed.  I am happy with my purchase and recommend it. I am very pleased with this cleanser. I truly does clean and make your skin soft. My husband noticed my softness in my skin after 1 day! And for a man that's a compliment. I would suggest using the system together. Well worth getting or I should say its a must. Murad essential cleanser is great.. So smooth. Doesn't bother my sensitive skin. I would recommend this product. Great buy.Shipped quickly too. I really love this face wash!  It gets my face clean and it has these tiny microbeads that exfoliate lightly. It doesn't break me out and it doesn't dry out my skin, either.  It looks brighter after I use it. Will continue to purchase! This cleanser is the only stuff that helps with dry and oily skin, I had pimples on my forehead for the longest time... I tried everything, even retin A, which was awful! Murad cleanser is amazing, bumps are gone and now my skin is smooth! Don't waste your money by buying other products, this is the stuff! I have been using Murad products since 1994 and this facial soap is incredible and vital, and very luxurious.  It hydrates your skin so well.  I use it twice a day and it is great to use after shaving.  Cannot do without it.  Highly recommend it to men and women to use twice a day!  It will keep your skin looking and feeling young!  Use the Essential C Toner spray after you wash as they make the perfect combination. I was first introduced to Murad products while having a facial. I have since fallen in love with their line. I have mixed and matched several items from the different lines to meet my skincare needs. I have combination skin and have been forever looking for a line that will balance me out. This has a wonderful orange scent that I LOVE! It is not harsh on my skin, it does not dry it out. It lasts a long time too! When I first started to use it I had a mild breakout but that is expected when you start a new system, especially one with products this good! I'm a fan for life! I prevously wrote a review of this product stating it was delivered in a wrong container and it was fake.  This was the wrong company I was writting about.  The company was Omni Solutions that sent me a wrong/fake product.  This retailer sent me the essential C cleaners and it came on time was REAL and in perfect condition.  I am truly sorry for mistaking this company for the other one I had ordered from.  I had ordered all products on the same day from Amazon. I would buy from this retailer again. I learned about this cleanser when I was getting a facial.  The beautician recommended it.  I love it because it cleans my face of all dirt, oil and makeup really well but it does not dry my skin at all!  I really like the way my skin feels after using this product.  I recommend it! Best morning face wash on the market. I tried to use Lancôme gel cleanser because it was backup when I ran out of Murad and couldn't stand not having the Essential C. It's a great cleanser that's not harsh but leaves skin feeling fresh and soft, but the citrus aroma in the morning is the best part. I had continuous acne problems on my face before using this, and after using many antibiotics and topical treatments, my g/f recommended I use this and it has pretty much completely cleared my acne. Very refreshing! This cleanser was recommended by my aesthetician. The vitamin C is helping get rid of the dry flakes on the surface of my skin. I highly recommend this product. If you have very sensitive skin, check on the ingredients before purchasing as it may be a little bit aggressive than mild cleansers. I was introduced to Murad after getting a facial. I was sad when I used up the last bit of the tiny bottle I purchased in a sampler set. After having to use Nutrogena, I could see what a difference this product made from the glowing of my skin to how light and easy to wash off it was. Plus, the price on Amazon is much cheaper than purchasing at Ulta or any store that carries Murad. Shipped in 2 days, and the product was exacly what I had expected. Murad C Cleanser is very good to your skin.  I bought this after getting tired of good cleansers that left my face tight.  This stuff cleans well and leaves your skin soft and supple.  I love it and will get another one soon, esp good in the winter months (NY) i have used this before a friend had me try it. i was looking where the best place to get it would be...of course amazon! i received it on time and i have to say its not specifically noted that it helps with acne but let me just say i have tried so many prducts including changing my make up. but this has helped so muxh the change in my complexion is drastic. i love it and i will be ordering it regularly! thank u murad I use this after exfoliating every couple of weeks. My skin loves it. I use two other Murad products almost every night before bed - I alternate the Active Radiance Serum with the Environmental Night Cream. My skin seems to drink these products, and has become noticeably more smooth, and problems like dryness or oiliness are considerably less. Makeup goes on a lot better. Amazing. Simply and irrevocably amazing.  I show my sister in law the results of the pigment serum. My arms were riddled with age spots.  THEY ARE TOTALLY GONE NOW. This regimen with the Essential - C cleanser is the bomb. The BEST ever.  Worth every penny. Only had this a few days so i am hoping it works as well as the normal murad cleanser, if not better! just wanted something new and I do enjoy the smell and little beads. I wash my make-up off first with ivory soap so this can actually work. Always follow with the Murad Acne Clearing Solution! I used to buy the travel size versions of this when I was in grad school because I couldn't afford anything bigger. When I saw this on Amazon I scooped it up because you can see drastic results in a matter of a week. This stuff really helps to improve skin and discoloration. It's the perfect cleanser. Love this cleanser, it thoroughly cleanses the skin.Two steps in one. Excellent price from the buyer.Will purchase from this buyer again. This is an excellent cleanser.  Works well with periodical breakouts and doesnt dry my skin out and create fine lines.  I wouldn't suggest if you have serious acne issues but this works so well for me because I do not. Leaves my skin feeling clean and has a great citrus smell. This is an amazing mask. I use this once a week and my skin is amazing. Smooth, soft, clear. Totally recommend Murad products. FYI, if you're looking to clear up your acne, initially you'll break out but that's just the deeper zits coming to the surface to GTFO. I love this stuff! I have acne prone skin and I chose this face wash because its winter and this has essential vitamins to help keep my face moisturized from the cold weather. It works well for my skin and it's helped with some of my acne marks. I use this entire line of the Environmental Shield.  These products are wonderful.  I suffer from hyper pigmentation and after about 2 months of using this product line, my skin has a nice youthful glow.  I would recommend this product. to everyone. I love this cleanser. It's a perfect fit for those hot summer months when it's hot and humid. It helps with excess oil and dirt without over drying. I do have to watch the usage in the winter though. It tends to be drying in cold, dry weather. This is a product I have used for over 10 years.  It is great and leaves my skin looking fresh and bright.  Love it I have been using this product for 5 years.Im 64 years old and it really helps my face Good product.  Like buying here cause I don't have to make store hours but the price is no better or worse then  anywhere.  But I have acne prone and weather aged skin.  This product is perfect addition to a healthy skin regimen. This is the best best face wash product  ever made... I love it. It makes modes my face some and clearer, than ever before. I love this produce. It really works!!! I highly recommend  it.  :) My expectations are always exceeded when purchasung products through Anazon.com.  Products are always packaged appropriately and delivered when promised.  I am also pleased with the performance of Murad Skin care line. It leaves my skin feeling very soft and does not dehydrate. It has a very light, fresh scent. It's great for everyday use. I recently purchased this cleanser to complete my set of Murad for dark pigmentation. This cleanser has barely any scent to it,foams up very nicely,and rinses off cleanly.My face feels so soft,ready for the next step of the toner. It is not drying to my skin in any way.Even if not purchasing the entire line,this cleanser is perfect for every day use,as it leaves your face refreshed and renewed and ready for the day.Definitely will continue to use!, I have bought the whole kit at sephora I bought the trial kit loved it so much bought more from Amazon because it was so much cheaper noticed a change in my face after the 3 day brighter skin and sunspots a whole lot lighter loved it so much I ordered the acne kits to try for my teenage kids I hope it work as well I will write a review on that kit. Love the products very good !!! I've had melasma (dark spots on face)for 10 years and tried absolutely every dark spot lightning product known to mankind. This is the ONLY one that has actually worked. Since 2 different dermatologists told me my melasma was caused from hormones and not the sun, it never occurred to me to use vitamin C  or sun damage products. I tried this on a whim along with the age spot pigment lightening serum. After 3 days of use morning and night I noticed dramatic fading in my spots on my cheeks and a general brightness to the rest of my face. After 10 days my spots were so faded that I could actually skip using my concealer and foundation.  I couldn't believe it. My spots had beenthe size of silver dollars! I bought the SPF 30 moisturizer as well and will never ever use anything else. It's changed my life.People with some kind of skin condition on their face will really know how much this means. It gave me my confidence back because people arent staring at my cheeks now when they talk to me. And Murad products are less expensive on Amazon than Ultra and Sephora. LOVE this face wash for nighttime.  It smells great, lathers nicely and doesn't scratch my sensitive skin.  My husband uses it for his skin now too and it helped with a skin condition/rash he recently battled on his face.  It washes off makeup, even my waterproof mascara, without being harsh.  I've tried almost every other brand out there and this is by far my most favorite and the only one I will use now.  Murad products are of great quality, consistency and they do exactly what they say.  Received this on time and perfectly packaged.  Every murad cleanser comes sealed with a signature foil top and this one had it.  Exactly the same as if I purchased it from Murad itself. Removes all makeup and oil .  Love this product and will be using it from this point I . It's very gentle and easy to use.I got this soap As a treatment for sun spots, and I knowest that about 80% of  my acne went away. I bought a 2-oz version of this at Ulta as a kind of impulsive buy at the checkout counter since it was a nice, travel-friendly size, I've always heard good things about Murad, and, hey, a little vitamin C can't be bad. I've tried many cleansers and this is the first that actually does something for my skin (which is pretty normal, but occasionally breaks out). Some cleansers wash off makeup but do nothing else and others do a little too much, stripping my skin of oils and leaving it taut and dry. This, however, cleansed gently and left my skin feeling softer, smoother, and clearer the next day. I can't vouch for it being an ""environmental shield,"" or for any functional purpose of the little orange beads, but I like the way it left my skin and it's definitely a go-to when my skin breaks out as it really seems to help prevent redness and scarring.**EDIT 1/26/2014:**It's been close to 4 years since I first began using this product and it's still my favorite cleanser. If only it were a little cheaper! Although, it does seem to last a while. I've used the product on and off over the years, usually a few times a week before bed, sometimes applying with a face brush (which creates a lather, allowing me to use less product). The rest of the time I use a gentle cleanser like Cetaphil just to remove sweat & make-up. Occasionally I'll try another cleanser and will use that for a few months but it seems I inevitably end up returning to this. I've probably gone through 1 full-sized and 2 travel-sized tubes in a little less than 4 years. The price for how long it lasts (and for reliable results) is actually not too bad when you think about it. I've also gradually learned over time that you tend to get what you pay for, and having healthy skin is something I'm willing to pay for. Ive used this product for over a month. I initially bought the startup pack just to trial it before I decided to spend the big bucks for the bigger size. DEFINITELY worth it. I have seen my sun spots slowly disappear. My only regret now is that I didn't get any before pictures to show. I used to just wear makeup to cover it up, but the dark spot was still a little noticeable below my eye. I also had hyperpigmentation above my lip area and it made me look like I had a mustache. That was also difficult to cover up and I would notice it in pictures, even with makeup on. I do use all 3 steps every other day which include the cleanser, toner, and moisturizer with sunscreen and occasionally the advanced avtice radiance serum (occasional being 1x every 10 days). However, I do use the cleanser and moisturizer daily. I've tried a few of the Murad facial cleanser's now: Essential-C, Time Release Acne and AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleansers and this is by far the better for me. I have normal to oily skin and the other products were just too harsh on my face. Left my skin dry and actually increased my breakouts. After a few weeks back on  Essential-C my skin is back to normal and feeling great! I've used this product for a few years now. Every time I run out or try something and go back. I notice how nice my skin looks and realize it's this product!! Love using this face wash to wash makeup off at night. It's gentle and smells so refreshing. A little goes a long way!!! This product last me a long time and it's not a bad price. I always had perfect skin as a teen and in my mid 20's I broke out with severe adult acne. I tried EVERYTHING. It was almost worse because I had never had acne as a teen so I literally didn't know how to deal with it. I tried this because I was afraid the Murad Acne Wash would be too drying. I bought this at the beginning of January and LOVE LOVE LOVE it. My skin is flattened out. I don't get giant painful cysts anymore. Around my period I MIGHT get a small white head or two but this product makes it go away quickly (sometimes over night) without drying the rest of my skin out!!!! My skin didn't purge which was also a huge plus. It's not great at removing make up but I just use bar soap quickly to wash it off. It's not a makeup remover so don't expect it to be. It's quite moisturizing and doesn't strip. Rub it on wet skin for 30 seconds, then re-wet your finger tips and rub again. It takes a bit to lather but I think that's why it doesn't strip.I wash my face with this, then do a quick swipe of witch hazel, and the moisturize with cetaphil. Also, twice a week I've been doing a 40% lactic acid peel from MakeUp Artists Choice to lighten my scars (***use witch hazel before and after use of the lactic acid...). My skin is finally clearing up and my scars are dramatically lightening. Between this cleanser and the lactic acid my skin is starting to get back to normal!!!!!! I've been doing it for two months and the difference is insane!!!! Give it a try!!!!!!!! I can't wait to see the results in a few more months!!!! I will check back in!!!! I got a facial 6 months ago. The esthetician recommnended the Murad vitamin C cleanser. It sooo amazing! My skin looks clearer and feels smooth after every use. I use it 2x a day, morning and night. Very pricey but definitely worth the price! Love how my face feels after washing with Murad Environmental Shield Essential C. I've been using Murad for years, love their product and my skin shows it.  A couple years ago I switched to another product..just for a change but I missed Murad.  I'm back with it again:). I love the way this cleanser smells and makes my skin feel. I was using Dermalogica and just felt like my skin was not getting better, but once I started using this face wash my skin cleared up. It doesnt have an overwhelming citrus scent like others, works great! I have used this product for many years and like it very much, but am always looking for a better price. Amazon delivers."
B000XSPQ62," I'm hooked on Dermalogica Clearing Skin Wash. I have always had very oily skin, which sometimes still leads to breakouts as an adult. I've tried all kinds of cleansers across many ranges of facial products (everything from drug stores to high-end to prescription lines), and this one happens to be the best at controlling oil and breakouts for me. I've always been willing to try new products and this one is a keeper because it's the only face wash that does the following for me:- removes excess oil- controls oil production- prevents breakouts and clears existing blemishes- does not over-strip skin or over-dry- does not cause irritation or peeling- smells mild and clean not perfumed- no parabens/pthalates/sulfites/dyes/perfumes - GOOD QUALITY ingredients that are safe to use daily and feel good! (ingredient list below) None of the harsh chemicals like benzoyl peroxide that can be too hard on anyone's skin- part of a full product line for adult skin that still has some challenges like oil or breakoutsI feel a lot better when I look better, so I always keep this on hand. If you try it and get immediate results like I did, look for the larger sized bottles which will save you money!Active ingredients: Salicylic Acid .50%. Other ingredients: Water/Aqua/Eau, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Angelica Archangelica Extract, Echinacea Angustifolia Extract, Allium Sativum (Garlic) Bulb Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Extract, Passiflora Incarnata Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Ophiopogon Japonicas Root Extract, Echinacea Purpurea Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Lactic Acid, Algae Extract, Menthol, Sodium PCA, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Camphor, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Benzyl PCA, Disodium EDTA Copper, Citral, Limonene, Geraniol, Citronellol. Smells great and has helped to improve my skin Amazing product,clears the skin beautifully Love it!!! love this stuff and use daily. i will switch it up in the winter and use a cream cleanser as my skin is drier then This is my favorite face wash. I've been using it for years now. Keeps my skin blemish-free. I was glad to find it here on Amazon for less than it would cost in the store. Good stuff, just shake it up for a while when you first get it in case it separated I use this product all the time and it is great.  Thank you. I started developing adult acne a couple of years ago. It was embarrassing to have more acne than I did when I was a teenager. I started using Dermalogica products and my skin started clearing within a week. It has made a huge difference for me. This stuff lasts for ever. I have only bought two bottles in my whole life and I've been using this stuff for like five or more years. Works great for oily skin or acne and it's so worth it. Not outrageously foamy or smelly. Doesn't irritate, it just does the job. I highly recommend it if you're on the fence. I'm a huge fan of dermalogica and needed some more for my trip to Bora Bora as my skin always explodes while traveling, especially on ling plane flights. I used this before my flight and right after and I was blemish free! Amazon is 2nd to NONE !!!  By far the BEST company. I'm happy my cousin Sonia in Boston /NYC got me started shopping on Amazon. Dermatologica is the best skin care products, besides eminence , especially if your running between exercise classes. I have never had an issue with an products through Amazon. I love that a little goes a long way in using this as a face wash.  it is very light and delicate and really cleans your face well.  I would recommend this product to use. I really love the way this makes my face feel. At first, I broke out like a teenager all over again. I had to cut back to every other day usage for the first few weeks but now I am able to use it daily. I cannot believe how clean my face feels. My skin which tends to be oily is now balanced out. My pores have shrunk and there have been no further breakouts for me. I would definitely caution 1st time users to only use a little bit not a full pump. And when purchasing pay close attention to the OZ on your order. I believe they show a larger bottle but unless you click on that size you will order the smaller size....... I plan on ordering this product again but due to the large size of the bottle and the small amount that I need, it will be a long while...... So glad to have found this product on here, usually I pay close to 45 bucks in store!  Saved money and it shipped fast!Finding a face wash that helps with my adult acne, has been a struggle.  I saw results in 4 days and within 2 weeks have a much clearer face.  The only time I truly break out now is when I am not getting enough sleep.  Need to get more sleep and continue to use and then see the even better results! Seems to be working ok! Started to clear up my skin and now I have a few breakouts which is normal when you start a new regimen. Smells and feels great on my skin. It's gentle enough to use daily and keeps my face clear. Safe...not harsh...I alternate between this a their Cleanser. Best facial wash for combination skin (mostly oily and breakout prone with some dry zones).  It works better than any other product out there.  Highly recommend to anyone struggling with problematic skin (but it does take time - it's not a one time wonder cleanser).  It took over a month of regular usage before I noticed a difference and now I refuse to be without it.  I can tell a difference in less than a week when I run out and have to use another cleanser (cetaphil).  I keep extra now to prevent running out of it. Enjoying this face wash very much! Makes my oil/ combo skin feel fresh and clean, I use it twice a day with no drying issues. Has helped clear up my post menopausal acne! I've tried nearly every face wash and skin product on the market (prescription / non-prescription) for acne.  I've been using this for about six months and while I still get the occasional breakout, it has seemed to help reducing breakouts. It lathers well and smells good. Love this product! After been acne free for most of my life, a new work out regime caused back breakouts like I had never seen before. After using this product for a couple weeks my back breakouts have almost disappeared. I believe in a couple more weeks or with more consistent use I will be back-acne free. The smell is great and it seems to be non-drying. Been using Dermalogica for years. Love this face wash Thank you ! Great cleanser when unwanted acne shows up but do follow up with the overnight clear gel. Can't live without this In my teen years I was plagued by really bad acne. Now that I'm 24, I no longer have actual clinical ""acne"", which is a relief. However, my skin is still very prone to periodic breakouts, which is why I'm constantly looking for a good skincare line. Yet most of the anti-breakout products I find in CVS are way too harsh for my skin--the levels of salicylic acid are much too high for my skin. If you're a teenager or a woman older than 35, CVS is the perfect place to find good skincare products at great prices. But if you're in your 20s and early 30s, there is no product that is really well-balanced for your mature-but-not-too-mature skin.I started looking at Dermalogica at first because they are Leaping Bunny certified [...]. This means that they absolutely do not test on animals and are cruelty-free, which is something Clinique and other high-end skincare lines can't say. After a bit of research, I decided to take the plunge and plunk down the money for the Clearing Skin Wash, Gentle Cream Exfoliant, and Oil Control Lotion. And I'm so thankful I did! My skin is noticeably healthier and shine-free, and I haven't had a breakout since I started using these products. I still get the occasional pimple around my period, but nothing like the breakouts I was getting before.Before you buy any Dermalogica product, I highly recommend visiting their website [...]. They have an interactive tool that helps you determine which products are best for your skin, which is how I decided on the three products I purchased. You can also check to see if your salon/spa sells Dermalogica, but be prepared to pay a lot more than what you'll find here on Amazon. Arrived on time and as described! Fast shipping! This product works like a charm on adult acne! Wow! My skin peeled for the first week or two, but now I get compliments on my skin daily and haven't had a break out in a month I am 30 years old and still have frequent breakouts (mainly around my mouth and chin). Once I started using this wash, my breakouts cleared up and I did not have a single blemish for months. I still have small breakouts every now and then but this product has controlled it 98%!Also, other acne products tend to dry my skin out. This product does not. I love this product. I have acne prone skin, suffer from monthly cystic breakouts and this has helped me control this amazingly. I have not had  a large breakout since, and the occasional pimple goes away quickly. Causes some dry patches, but this is to be expected from medibac products as your skin adjusts. Will be ordering this again. Delivery was fast and product was as described. I have always had pretty good skin and have never really had to worry about acne. Except on my back and shoulders, and during summer it can defiantly make me self conscious. I have dry skin so this would ruin my face, but i love it as a body wash and even my boyfriend has found it helpful as a body wash as well. It works really nicely to go in a clean out the bacteria and clear the skin up. For a body wash it isn't as harsh and works wonderfully! Wish I would of had this product in high school because I tried every type of cleanser out there. I use this alone or with a pre wash or with a pre oil, before cleansing my face with this wash.  I love how it feel on my skin and I have  noticed that my skin does not feel oily or dry.  It has helped to clear my complexion up. Vert impressed with this Skin Wash! Finally a Wash That does not dry my skin. Havé noticed a changé in my skin and déf. Buying The big bottles. Glad I tried The small bottle ;-) after two months of using, I just asking my self where is it all my life ????i love it really, its help my face and my acne too much. its not to clean your face its also to help your acne in your face. if you have acne in your face you should buy it. Got this for my daughter who's been using it for a few days now and her skin is already improving. A lot of the red swollen pimples she had have definitely decreased in size and redness has subsided. If this keeps up we will definitely keep ordering this. This is the only face wash I buy. I have tried them all. I have very fair and sensitive skin. I also have very oily and acne prone skin. Without question, this is the best product I have found. It doesn't dry out my skin or cause allergic reactions. If you are unsure, try the trial size/travel size first. But, you won't be disappointed. I love this stuff and will use nothing else. Now, of course it is not a magical cure-all. What I love about it is that it doesn't dry out my skin yet it cleans it well and does its part to fight my acne. I can't imagine using anything else. product was delivered on time and met expectations. Helps clear up acne very well Have been using this product for about a year.  I have seen much improvement in my skin.  I had monthly bad adult acne breakouts prior to using this product consistently. I highly recommend it. Couldnt stand my adult acne anymore. Shelled out the money for this stuff. Amazing and cleared my skin right up!!! I cannot use regular soaps or any other face wash for my very sensitive skin, so this face wash is a MUST in by bathroom at all times. It leaves my face feeling clean and fresh, and the makeup comes right off as well.Great product! I don't know how much money I have spent on face wash that claims to stop acne, but I'm sure at this point, I really don't want to know.  My brother suggested Dermalogica to me, so I tried out a small bottle of the clearing skin wash acne treatment.  For the first three or four days, my skin reacted to it and started adjusting.  My skin felt scaly and rough, but I kept using it.  By the start of the second week, my skin was softer and smoother than it's ever been, and breakouts were reduced to almost nothing.  I've been using Dermologica now for approximately four months and could not be happier.  If I say something about my bad acne, people ask me what I'm talking about.  I would definitely recommend this product. This product cleared up my skin within 24 hours. How is that even possible?! I am one happy customer! I buy this as a gift for my mom every year, once a year... that's how often she needs to replace it. Huge bottle! 50+ years old w/ occasional adult acne (looking forward to that) and she only uses Dermalogica brand to control skin issues. By far my favorite cleansing product.  Worth every penny *THIS* cleanser wasn't right *for my skin* - it was just too drying.  But it *did* help clear up some acne that was really bothering me.  I passed it along to my teenaged daughter, though, and she LOVES it - hasn't been overly drying for her and has really cleared her face up!  So I'm giving it 5 stars because I believe it's a great product - just bear in mind that not every product will be right for your skin and sometimes we have to go through a few different products before we find the one that is right for us. I love dermalogica!  been using it exclusively since 1997.  I have very sensitive skin and a lot of allergies.  This cleanser is gentle and help with my acne without drying me up or making me red and sore.  and this size container is a great value! Finally found a cleanser that helps me fight adult acne. Great product. Works amazing. On all skin types. Definitely a great choice! Would recommend to all my friends!!! You won't regret buying this product love it very gentle! I was surprised that something like this wouldn't be drying but very nourishing and cleared my skin up fast. I am suffering from adult acne as I get older and this line cleared up my face in a week! amazing! Amazing product!  Fast delivery in 2 days.  I recommend this product to people who uses Murad or proactive to stop using it and get this product for a better result!  I used Murad for over 10 years and seemed like it worked in the beginning but in the long run I still broke out.  Started using this product and my acne is now under control.  Amazing price for an amazing product! As a gay man in his 30s, I'm no stranger to decades of skin-cleaning regimens. I've tried Clearisil, Olay, Proactiv, Nuetrogena, the list goes on. Lucky for me, for my 30th birthday, I received a gift certificate for a Dermalogica facial. It was life changing. Ever since then, over the past hrmph or hrmph years, I've haven't strayed and my skin has never looked brighter. Highly recommended. Love it! Works well with combination/ sensitive skin I have purchased this cleanser from a dermatologist office but was very excited to find it considerable cheaper on Amazon.  A bottle this size will last a very long time because you only need a small amount per use.  I feel like other cleansers I have tried don't get all my make-up off and this does a great job with out being harsh or irritating.  LOVE IT!!! Only use this wash if your want perfect skin !! This product never fails to clear breakouts. Extremely good quality brand. Even more effective used with an exfoliating, cleansing brush. The soothing fragrance is a huge plus compared to the acidic acne washes available in my youth. This is the best face wash I've ever used! I've been using it now for over 10 years and my skin is always clear. I've told friends about it and they love it too. Really works well and it doesn't dry your skin out at all, and I have drier skin. Been using this face wash for 10 years. Won’t use anything else! Now my teenager is using it with a clear face 👍🏼👍🏼 I love the Dermalogica line. This face wash in particular is my favorite. It has cleared my face up from all acne which is a miracle considering I've been going to a dermatologist for years now spending hundreds of dollars on products that haven't worked. I've even tried proactive which didn't help at all. This face wash also smells great! a little minty. Does not dry your face and works great for minor acne.  I have been using for 3 years. A little goes along way you do not need more than a pea size amount. Helps! Best cleanser I've found that really removes makeup and sweat and has really helped my skin clear with regular use. Came quickly and as described Obsessed with this line! Way cheaper then buying this at Ulta. I use this 2 times maybe 3 times a day and this has lasted me months. You need very little and should only use every few days. Awesome!! My daughter has problem skin she picks and pops daily! After trying a sample for a week her skin cleared up and she even had a healthy glow! I bought her a 16.9 oz bottle! Thank you! My favorite face wash, have been using for years. Feels good, smells nice, and helps my acne. My husband and I both love it.  We have oiler skin but it leaves skin clean but not stripped. My wife and daughters all use this. I can't comment on the product but I can tell you my wife was paying more than this for half the size in the local retail store. And she's been using it for years so I know she loves it....and now she's getting twice as much for the same price. This is a fantastic product. I have always struggled with breakouts and this really keeps them at bay. Purchasing it on Amzon is significantly cheaper than from a department or beauty store, too! My skin is so much clearer and fresh feeling with this product. No film or sticky feeling after! Plus this bottle is a great deal! Ulta has a smaller bottle for like $40 Absolutely amazing and I love the slight fragrance it has. My 15 year old son uses it (for acne control) and I use it bc it is gentle, non-drying and keeps me from getting the occasional pimple. We both follow it with Dermalogica Skin Renewal Booster (a little pricey, but the tiny bottle lasts about 2 months bc it just takes the smallest drop for your whole face). Don't even try the Age-Smart Overnight Serum..... Ulta told me it was like the Skin Renewal Booster- not even close. It is oil, and stinks so bad I couldn't even leave it on my face. My sweetheart says it would be a great product for those nights ""I had a headache"" lol because he wouldn't even come near me! After 30 minutes the smell WAS STILL THERE! Great quality product and good pricing. Item as expected. Love dermalogica and would reccomend to anyone looking to clear up acne. Love this product. I love this product, but  WARNING do NOT get this jn your eyes by accident!!!!  My eye was irritated for 2 days. Love this cleanser! I have combination skin and this helps me so much! I've been using it everyday for the past two months and I see a significant difference! And the bottle is huge so it will last for months even using it a few times a day! Highly recommend! I love this face wash.  I was worried about ordering it from Amazon, but it's the genuine product at a better price.  It arrived sealed and in great condition. So happy to have found my favorite cleanser for a more reasonable price than what Dermalogica sells it for. Will definitely purchase again in the future. This stuff works really well. Helps clear up acne really well so long as you use it regularly. I actually got it faster than I was expecting. The only thing was there was some gunk inside the pump, but that was really easy to clean out so I'm not docking a star. Been using this product before purchasing on Amazon which is way cheaper. Would recommend for those who have bad acne or white heads. I love this facial cleanser. I always break out with other cleansers, but not this one. Keeps me clear and a little goes a long way! Best facewash I've ever used, and for the size, you can't beat the price.  It has a smooth, creamy, texture that is non-oily, and it lasts me for approx. 3 months.  You only need a little at a time to get a nice lather.  I use this along with Dermalogica's Daily Microfoliant, and I'm constantly receiving compliments regarding my ""pretty skin."" The best. I've been using for many many years! I acquired adult acne in my late 30s and have had a very hard time finding an effective face wash without drying out my skin.  I have been using Dermalogica at the recommendation of my eyebrow threading technician.  I was desperate and willing to try anything at that point, and I am glad I did.  What a difference it has made in my skin.  It feels great too, kind of cool and tingly.  Love it! I have been using this product for years and it is a great product for acne prone skin. The package was packed well and was shipped in a week. 5 stars! I use this along with all my Dermalogica medibac products and go for Dermalogica medibac facials. This is a must have. It works great for me because my skin can't handle products with scents or chemical additives. This is mainly or all natural ingredients from what my facial expert told me and I don't suffer with breakouts anymore. Product as described and it arrived quickly Works great!! Cleanses without drying out my skin AMAZING THATS ALL I CAN SAY! Awesome! Nice and light but gets a great lather to it! Great price and the bottle is huge! I have had it a few months now and it will definitely go a long way! Great product! I have an oily sking and by using the face wash makes break outs go away within a day or two Great price! I have adult acne that has been reduced to nothing at all since using this product. Great product for acne prone skin. Best face wash ever.  The only wash that won't dry my skin, but works on acne.  I never have a breakout.  I use it with the oil control lotion. This is an amazing cleanser for my oily, acne-prone skin. It removes excess oil, exfoliates the skin and fights against acne-causing bacteria all of which contribute towards minimising breakouts. Many medicated cleansers are quite harsh on the skin but the blend of natural plant extracts in this product reduces irritation. I have pale, sensitive, combination skin that is very acne prone & this has worked well for me. I bought this over a year ago & still have 1/4 of the bottle left. I also bought the travel size bottle & use this to refill it when I go away during the summer. I only wash my face once a day in the evenings, I think this does a great job of removing my makeup when used in combination with my face brush. It hasn't left my skin too dry either, but I always follow with my night cream routine. About a month after starting to use it I did notice a significant reduction in my acne breakouts & I've enjoyed clear skin ever since so I will definitely buy another bottle when mine does finally run out. I am 28 and have always struggled with adult acne. Recently I started breaking out really bad and I tried everything that did not require going to a derm. My friend recommended this, told me that her dermatologist highly recommends this brand, I could not be happier! My acne, big bumps, cleared up within a week of using this.A little goes a long way- I will def be re-purchasing and trying some of their other products. WASH HAS CLEARED UP MY FACE.  WHEN I HAVE A BREAKOUT AND USE TO THE DIRECTIONS IT WORKS WONDERS. WILL BUY AGAIN. This is the second time I'm purchasing this, leaves my face with a clean and fresh feeling. Highly recommend for sensitive skin Best skin cleaner ever!! Great product! Clears acne Awesome product.  Love the larger size. Give it time to work and you will definitely see a difference and improvement Exact item Great Product Great product! I love this product. It keeps my face clear & smooth When I first used this wash I was amazed how my skin felt...like velvet! It makes my skin feel so soft, and dries out my acne. You have to buy this stuff, and only a small dab will wash your entire face, so it should last you a good year. Def recommend it! Great cleanser. It's a little on the strong side so I only use once a day. I have oily skin and this really helps keep it in check. This stuff really helps prevent pimples and skin break-outs. It is a VERY EFFECTIVE product. I find it works best if used almost daily and I have experienced no side effects.This is the best facial soap that I have ever known. That explains it. This is the best skin wash on the market!  My skin looks great! Doesn't get better in gentle cleansing. No skin irritations or drying effect. Has become a staple in my skincare regime. Amazing! I have adult acne and nothing does such a good job of clearing up my face. I have tried many cleansers but this one has them beat. It gets rid of my acne without drying my face Definitely helps keep my skin clean and comes in a huge bottle so will probably last a long time This product is amazing! I am 20 years old and have struggled with acne for so long and nothing would help.  Now, my skin is improving everyday.  If it weren't for this product, I would still feel like a 15 year old who just broke out with terrible skin.  It's worth every penny. great great great Love this product. Really helps keep my skin clear This really helps my daughter control her acne. Great product! Love it and great price with fast service I love this stuff! excellent for sensitive skin, keeps acne away! I turned 25 and started getting bad, deep pimples. Nothing else worked but this stuff. Now i never get pimples unless i skip a day using this. Highly recommended and worth the price. It last a LONG time too. I like Dermalogica products. I use this face wash when my skin gets congested, been using this particular product for years and still happy with the results. I use this after the pre cleanse.  Feels great and makes my face ready for makeup Just like I expected! Great product great! My Son loves how it clears up his complexion! This skin wash keeps my skin nice and clean.  I rarely break out when I use this on daily basis.  I use it in the morning and I use it in the evening and it does its job.  Great for oily skin.

Helps I really like Dermatologica products. For the first time in my life my skin has stopped breaking out and pores are shrinking. Will definitely keep buying Dermalogica is a great skin line that targets all skin types.  The Clearing Skin Wash really does clear my skin - that is prone to breakouts.  This is not inexpensive product, but it's so worth it and will save you in having to go get facials on a regular basis. Demalogica is the best! They make the best products.  They're a little pricey, but worth it.  With the quality, you use less, so it works out to be a good deal. I have noticed an improvement in my adult acne since using it.Definitely great for oily skin and adults with the occasional zit. have used this before and love it Good stuff! Be home acne! keeps skin clear of acne love Dermalogica Medibac Clearing Skin Wash. I love dermalogica products-they keep my skin blemish-free 95% of the time The best face wash and excellent seller. A++++++++ love this products This works great and does everything my aesthetician said it would.  This bottle also will last forever, since you really only need a pea sized drop. This is the only product that I've used that clears and prevents acne.  It helps perioral dermatitis as well.  I love it. use this every day.  Perfect skin. great product.  great price LOVE THIS PRODUCT I personally love this face wash. I can't use ot twice a day (my skin is very sensitive) but its perfect for once a day and keeps my acne under control. I ordered this product thinking I was going to receive what was pictured as the larger size with the pump but received the smaller one instead. I was extremely disappointed with Spa Look and sent the items back for a refund. I have used the product before and it works very well for acne-prone skin. Everything fast and worth it! My doctor recommended this brand for my oily and acne prone skin. I love it, it's a little spendy but it's worth it. I love how it smells, feels, and how it WORKS! Acne is mostly cleared up and soft! The perfect cleanser for any face type.  It suds, it leaves your face feeling clean not stripped, and it never causes any breakouts or oily response!  LOVE IT Love the pump that comes with the bottle. Great every day cleanser Love it! just as described... love the price and also the fact that it came a day early and so much better price than going to any store... Love dermalogica! Love this skin care line! fast delivery and great price! works well This is just about the perfect cleanser. I like all the products from this company but his cleanser is one of my favorites. It works very well on skin that is oily also. I recommend any product from this company and if you are looking for a great over all cleanser that helps exfoliate the skin. Great. I've tried all kinds of face wash to see if it improves the look of my skin and prevents the occasional pimple. Out of the dozens I've tried, this is by far the best I've ever used. It's more spendy than the others, but it's a great price on Amazon. I never get pimples anymore and this keeps my skin soft and beautiful. I'm complimented on my skin all of the time! I will be using this product for the rest of my life. :) I have been using dermalogica for about a year.  It has cleared up my skin and works really well.  I have oily skin and this medibac line keeps my skin in line! This stuff is amazing! My face hasn't been this clear in 40 years! Yes I suffer from adult acne; mainly stubborn blackheads and in two weeks they are gone. I'm ecstatic! The smell is a very light fragrance; one you would expect in a high-end spa. It is very expensive, but I only use a 3 pea size amounts per day. I wash my face twice at night to make sure all makeup is removed and once in the morning. It does not dry out my 52-year-old face - I have combination skin. Afterwards I spray my face with blue flame purifying toning mist to help out with my large pores and follow up with Ove Beauty anti aging/anti wrinkle cream. All 3 are new to my beauty regimen...the combo is working!!💓 Excellent Product! great product BEST I love this line, my skin is amazing since I started using it! I been using this for years and of cos i need it to be cheaper.  The only way is to buy it more at a more economical price.  That is why this 1 quart size is great! Great product My skin has never been smoother. I have not had a breakout since I purchase these items. I will order the mask next. Great product Been using for years and keeps skin clean and clear. This is some really good stuff.  I've spoken to plastic surgeons, and facialists and all of them recommend this product. Great product Good Really good this product i first used at a salon getting a facial so i bought this and it really cleaned my skin.i wish i could get all the products. Perfect in a large size so reordering will be at a minimal.  Better than the small travel sizes and very affordable. Love my face wash. Dermalogica has always been the brand for me. Happy with the product and the shop I ordered it from.  Smooth transaction all around. Good thing, It is a big bottle, good price, and helpful for the acneic face. I love it. All dermalogica are great products. This was a great value. My dermatologist recommended this product and will last for two or three months. Shipped quickly. A+ Great product. Excellent My skin feels so fresh and clean after I use this. No tightening of the skin, no oily residue. Just pure clean skin! I BEEN TOO SEVERAL HIGH END SALON TO BUY THIS PRODUCT...NOW I CAN JUST ORDER TIME  ITEM ON LINE THANKS! I wonder if it's being discontinued as I have been having a hard time finding it. It's my favorite acne wash for the body, effective without irritating. GREAT face wash. Have never had skin this clear. However, I recommend that you buy your own refillable containers for travel, since the bottle it comes in tends to leak. Love Love Love this line of products!  This is the only face wash that battles my acne without drying and peeling.  Highly recommended for adult acne sufferers.  WARNING younger users and those with very oily skin might find this ineffective.  This product is not for you! I made the mistake of trying something new when I ran out of my original Dermalogica.  That was a mistake.  The product I used was overpriced and smelled horrible!  I'm sorry Dermalogica for my wondering eye.  I will never leave you again!THESE PRODUCTS ARE AMAZING!!!If you have sensitive skin, be cautious.  My skin is tough so this product is perfect!!You wont be disappointed!! This is the ONLY face wash that works for my skin...after having a baby and moving to the south (whoa humitiy) nothing was working for me, not Proactive (wish it did because its cheaper)...so i just suffered through it until a friend who represents Demalogica, company gave  me alot of samples and it amazed me, finally found something. I really hate the price BUT ill pay it to keep clear skin. I was looking far a great face wash for me, I tried everything but it left my face to oily or to dry, I used this product one time and my face felt like I just got a facial. My face feels so smooth & clean, I am so excited to find my face wash and I will let everyone know. Thank you for making such a awesome product. Love these products! It's the only thing helping with my adult acne while breastfeeding. I've had issues with breakouts for years, and I finally came across this product one day in an Ulta store. I remember thinking how expensive it was, but that if it worked, it'd be worth it. It worked SO well that within 2 weeks my skin was completely clear. I had tried everything from proactiv to going to the dermatologist and getting prescription creams / oral medication and nothing could completely clear my skin. This is the only product that has worked for me. Definitely recommend it. I always buy my Dermologica products on Amazon, in the larger professional size. It's typically the same price as the tiny size you buy at the spa.  Just make sure your products come from a seller with good reviews and have all of the proper seals when they arrive. My daughter asked me to buy her this product, so I went on line and found this vendor and was fairly priced and shipped promptly! Made her happy, so was pleased. Pawpaw I've tried countless face washes within the last 25yrs for my acne. When I first purchased this and started using it I thought it was just going to be another one that wasn't going to work. The face wash worked great. My face is so clear, dark spots have got a whole lighter, blackheads have disappeared and my face feels and looks great. I highly recommend this facewash. I have struggled with acne for 15 years.  I am extremely self conscious about it, but had been dealing with it so long that honestly sometimes I forget that its not something that should be acceptable.  It's not something everyone has to deal with at 28 so why should I have to?  It's a terrible thing to be sitting in a conference room trying to feel confident and capable and looking around the room at all my clear skinned, fresh faced colleagues who don't even have to slather on makeup every morning like I do.  I have tried prescriptions, over the counter, Proactiv, Melaleuca, and nothing has worked - until Dermalogica Medibac.The Medibac line is specifically for adult acne, and it works!  I started with the starter set, which is shockingly tiny, but lasted quite a while.  The first item I ran out of and had to buy the full size was the skin wash.  You only need a little so it lasts a long time.  It's not too drying either which was a big concern for me since it's winter and my skin is very prone to dryness.I don't know how it works when nothing else has, but it does.  Besides a  few fading scars, my skin is clear for the first time in years.  I've switched from cakey full coverage makeup to BB cream which I never thought would be possibel.  Dermalogica Clearing Skin Wash is expensive, but will last a long time and is absolutely worth it.  You can't put a price on clear skin. I first discovered this product a few years ago when it was recommended to me by my esthetician. I have extremely oily skin that constantly breaks out. The entire dermalogica skin clearing line has helped me tremendously. Great every day cleanser that leaves my skin feeling clean and glowing! Ditto used with over night gel. I love this product! Great Great Great Very happy! Best to use every other day or during the summer. Can dry out eye area. Best face wash I have found so far! I suffer from stress related occasional adult acne, and have tried quite a few products, including prescription antibiotics and other topical ointments, as well as the entire Proactive line of products (which aren;t bad - but didn't help very much, either). I've been using this face wash for a few weeks now, in combination with the overnight clearing gel when needed, and have noticed a significant improvement already. It doesn't dry out my skin, is very gentle, and certainly has made a difference.You don't need to use very much of it, so the 16.9 fluid ounce bottle will last me quite a long time. If you suffer from adult acne, this product is definitely worth trying!!! Finally, my skin is clear and I am feeling confident.  I'm a 36 years gal who has fought acne with everything... Everything.  Accutane.  Obagi.  Any and all potions from the drug store,  clarisonic,  charcoal soaps and ritualistic prayers from the skin God.  This works! I was going to wait to post this review so I could try it longer, but I'm just so excited! My skin has cleared up completely within 2 days of using this face wash. TWO days!!! I have PCOS and have struggled with acne since puberty. I used proactiv as a teen and it worked great, but I wanted to find something that was a better value. I decided to try this and was sceptical when it seemed like a mild dish soap the first time I used it. I seriously did not think it would do anything. The smell is mild, it left my skin feeling moisturized, glowing, and refreshed instead of raw, and tight. I have now used it 4 times, and my skin looks the best that it has in YEARS. I need less makeup, and I didn't even have to use any concealer today. I don't remember the last time I didn't have to use concealer. This may be a little more expensive than some face washes, but it's a nice sized bottle that I can tell will last awhile, and it will save me money not having to buy makeup as often. Seriously I cannot stop singing the praises of this product!! Thank you Dermalogica!!!!!! This thing is amazing! My face has cleared up so so much! I've tried all the big name facial products and this is the only one that works! All I use is this cleansing wash and that alone has made a huge difference! I'm highly considering purchasing more products from dermologica. I'm not sure what I need because this was face wash has been great. Do not have doubts when considering this product! If you want clean clear skin, order it! I had acne when I was young, and I would say that I have combination skin now as an adult, so I tried the Medibac wash just to help my skin out. I like how I can use this to get my makeup off as well as cleanse my face. I feel like it helps to balance my oil production. My face always feels clean and smooth after I wash with this. I also have very sensitive skin and this has never irritated or caused a break out. Last time around, I accidentally ordered the Dermalogica Special Cleansing gel wash, and it left my skin feeling slimy and it didn't take off my makeup. I didn't feel that the Special Cleansing gel was good for me because it made my face more oily. The Dermalogica Medibac lasts me about 9 months when I order the big bottle. I only use it at night to wash my face and take makeup off. I've been using this product for over 5 years, and still love it! Before I used this product, I used over the counter items and would have a breakout every month. Since using this product, it is VERY rare that I get even one pimple. I would highly recommend this product if you tend to have oily or combination skin. I have acne and struggled for years finding the best cleanser. THIS is the best. The product lasts forever. I have mind for nearly a year and still have tons to go. a little of it goes a LONG way. plus it is so good at removing ALL makeup in one wash. I HIGHLY recommend. This product is saving my skin!  I went from never having much of s struggle with acne to a huge huge acne problem after a failed trial with oil cleansing (which is terrible for some people btw).  Ever since I stopped oil cleansing my skin has looked the worst it ever has in my life.  I have spent months hiding my face and using prescription medications with no success.  I was so upset that I decided I needed to try something else so I splurged and went for the good stuff.  I am in cosmetology school and I know these products are very well respected.  I have only been using this for one week (as well as some other products from the Medibac line, I'm looking at you ""overnight clearing gel"") and I have already seen such a huuuggggeee improvement in my face.  Pimples that really haven't budged in months have cleared up. I feel confident with another week or so all my breakouts will be gone!  It's like a miracle.  Now I just have to get rid of my red scarring.  But honestly, when you're broken out you get pretty desperate and this is sooo worth the money! Absolutely fantastic face wash if you have skin that breaks out. My niece ran out for a few weeks and her face broke out. Within two days of using this it cleared back up! See her text in the photo. So... I'm nearly 51. I started using Dermalogica Clearing Skin Wash probably 6-7 years ago... that would have put me in my mid-40s... I had nonstop ""difficult"" skin even from my teenage years. Since using this product, my skin has been the exact opposite as before. A regular cleaning routine with this product has been near magic. I have not had a single breakout, or even close, in the 6-7 years I've been using it. I have been using this product for years to wash my face. My husband has realized how well it cleans your face. I leave it in the shower for us to use. Recommend this for washing your face.  I also use their face cream. I am 67 yrs. old. Im so happy I bought this wash again. I have been using this specific wash for over two years. In highschool I used proactive and it worked well until I hit college. Then it didn't do much and my skin had new needs. I would try all sorts of oil free, pore cleansing, medicated, blah blah blah from the beauty isle in my grocery store. Everything left my skin feeling messy, heavy, clogged, dry..etcWhen I hit 22 my lower jaw area began to break out really bad for the first time. It turns out this is a pretty common area for women to break out because of hormones..So I needed something new. My mom let me try some of her dermalogica and for the first time in years, my skin felt light and clean! She took me to ulta to get the medicated adult acne skin line. I haven't used anything else since.A month ago I ran out..I don't have a store close to me to pick this up, so I put it off. My skin got so bad. It was always clogged and had new little pimples popping up. I NEED a good cleanser because my face gets covered in dust and dirt at work so I need all the help I can get. I ordered this from amazon and it came very quickly. I used it immediately and I am happy to report it's still amazing!I have sensitive, oily skin. This cleans it deeply but it is not harsh. My skin feels refreshed and light. I find it's best to follow with a light moisturizer or BB cream. I use dermalogica for my moisturizer as well. Hope this helps! I started using this a few weeks ago and I really love it. I've always had bad skin and I've been using prescription aczone for about a year now which helped a lot but wasn't perfect. I'm using this in addition to the aczone and my skin looks great! I haven't had clear skin since I was about 12 lol but now I've stopped wearing makeup to work. Beyond impressed with the efficacy of this face wash. The wash clears the toxins and excess oils like none other and my skin has really improved since using this and I am not acne prone but produce a lot of oils and it leaves my skin reddish and shiny. Now with this wonderful wash this is not the case. HOWEVER, please beware, the efficacy is so off the charts that you need to carefully use this product. This is a clearing wash meaning it will dry out the skin and should be used infrequently if you are not under the care of a dermatologist or skincare professional. After a few weeks of use I developed severely dry eyes and the skin around my eyes. I can't 100% say this is the cause, but I should not have been so careless. This is wonderful clearing wash and I don't need to use it everyday. So I now use it a few times a week and all is back to normal. This is not the wash or the company, this was all on me and now I know. I highly recommend this product, but use with care and consult a skincare professional for a proper clearing regimine. Great price!  I love this face wash!  I have very oily skin ad this has helped with oil control and cleared up my skin nicely!  I also use the overnight clearing gel and they make an awesome team!  My skin looks better than ever! I have had lots of skin changes over the last few years (and two babies,) but after having a facial at a local spa and experiencing such great results when the aesthetician used this product, I was sold. It has kept hormonal acne in check without being too drying, and I only need about a nickel size amount to get the job done. I used the whole bottle and actually ordered a second, which for me, is pretty amazing because I usually don't stick with a product that long- most of them just never work the way I need them to. Based on this review I have not used it on my face yet but I wanted to say that the reviews that are saying this item is fake is not true.  The item looks to be truly good, and smells good. Either those that said this item was a fake or a bad batch do not want you to purchase the item... I have pictures to show you...[...]  and  [...]Don't trust misinformed or corporate wag the dog fools. I really like Dermalogica and have used it on and off for years.  I always come back to this Medibac Clearing face wash because it's honestly the best for my skin.  I've always had problem skin and unfortunately, even at 34, I still have quite oily skin prone to acne.  I also enjoy the Daily Microfoliant for exfoliation. Mild, effective, cleans deeply w/o drying. It is anti-aging, too. Great price!  This is about $10 cheaper than my local beauty supply! This is the best skin care system I’ve ever used! I’m 29 and have acne prone, combination skin and this has 100% changed my skin! I’m obsessed. I've had acne pretty much all my life, I'm 29 now.  I've tried everything - EVERYTHING- to clear my skin, but nothing has ever really worked.  My esthetician recommended the body wash and I liked it and Proactiv wasn't working for me, so I decided to give the clearing wash a try.  I bought the trial size, mainly because I'm a grad student so money is tight, and I wanted to try it out before I committed to spending $20-30.  I love it, and I am never using anything ever again.  Ever.  For the following reasons:1) A little goes a loooooooooooooonggggggg way.  Like I said, I bought the trial size, and that was in January.  It is now April, and I've used it pretty much every day, and I STILL have less than a quarter of a bottle left.  A very small amount, a little less than the size of a dime, produces a big lather!  It won't seem like it at first, but once it hits your face, there are suds everywhere.  Its actually pretty surprising how much a little amount can do.  Sometimes I exfoliate before I use the clearing wash, and when I do I need even less (pea-sized).  If any of you are worried about the cost, know that volume-wise, you're definitely getting your money's worth.2) Squeaky Clean!  It washes off well and leaves my skin with a very clean feeling.  It doesn't dry it out, and its very gentle so there's no irritation.  I've never had such a great feeling after washing my face before.3) Clear Skin.  It does what it says it will.  After using the product for four months, my skin looks much much better, and my breakouts have been greatly reduced.4) The scent.  Very lightly scented and it smells wonderful.So, to sum it all up, this product is awesome.  I recommend it to anyone who is fighting adult acne, or who has been fighting this battle their whole lives.... I like the brand and it works well on my skin.  Going through adult acne due to hormones and it has helped a lot with break outs. I was skeptical about trying this face wash but I absolutely love it! With any new face wash I always expect to break our more for the first week and it didn't happen. I've tried many different brands of face washes over the past 15 years and this will be the only one I buy from now on. The scent is light and nice too. My skin started to feel cleaner and look better within the first few days. I used it morning and night. I also purchased the tinted moisturizer since my favorite brand discontinued theirs and I really like that too. I have been struggling with acne since I was 11. I am now 23, and have developed a different kind of acne. Most of the time the pimples are painful and cyst-like. On top of my acne, my skin is very sensitive. A lot of products dry my face out really bad, which usually ends up making my acne worse.I am SO glad I decided to try Dermalogica's Medibac line. This cleanser is great! My skin feels soft and it is very gentle. While my acne is not TOTALLY gone, my skin feels SO much healthier. Also, I have only been using it less than a month, and my face gets better and better everyday. At first, I did have a few small breakouts, but after using it for about 2 weeks, my skin improved noticeably. Now it looks better than ever.I actually use the whole Medibac line (Clarifying Mattifier, Oil Control Lotion, Overnight Clearing Gel) and the Daily Microfoliant (it is probably my favorite product, no drying, no sensitivity, I can actually use it everyday, and it doesn't feel like you are scrubbing your skin off- just a gentle, skin-smoothing feeling.)I also would like to say that if you try this product, make sure you give it at least 3-4 weeks before you decide it doesn't work. It really started working the best for me recently, even though it did help my skin in the weeks before this, I still had a few breakouts. After experiencing some not so pleasant adult acne and trying a lot of drug store products, I turned to this in desperation. I love it! My face has never been more clear and I don't find that this dries out my skin which is a major plus as I get very dry skin especially in the winter. This face wash lasts me a long time because I only use a half a pump every time I wash my face, I find a whole pump to provide too much face wash. Hi, I tried a sample of Anti Bac and loved it!  The replacement product is the Medibac line which is based on Salylic acid, which SUX!  Anyone that reads this review should complain to Dermalogica.com, like I have, and request that they bring the product back or create a comparable solution, BESIDES lame Salylic acid, which does not work for most people.  Even Benziol Peroxzide is much better if going the chemical route, while I preferred the natural Anti Bac wash and it is the ONLY product they have that works for acne in a more natural way.  Please help me complain to Dermalogica.com.  Thank you! Best face wash yet FOR adult, oily, acne prone skin. My face is so soft after using this and it gets all my make up off nicely. I love this whole line. It keeps my oily skin feeling much less oily and I finally found something that works. Check out the whole line. It's pretty amazing. Highly recommend. I am a middle-aged woman with mild to moderate rosacea, characterized by a bit of redness and large, persistent zits (best way to describe it without being too gross). I have seen a couple of dermatologists and have used both topical and systemic antibiotics with pretty good results, but the prospect of being on long-term antibiotics certainly does not appeal to me (in addition, the newer time-released formulation of doxycycline is terribly expensive). I started using Dermalogica Clearing Skin Wash several months ago and was able to discontinue all daily-use prescription medications (the occasional stray blemish responds well to a few days of topical medicine). I don't think my skin has ever been this clear. There's no redness nor any dryness at all. A little seems to go a long way, it rinses off nicely, and it's really pleasant to use. I don't know whether more severe cases would have similar (if any) response to this product, but it's certainly worth a try in any event. I started using this face wash four weeks ago and it is AMAZING!!  I love it! I am 26 years old and recently started struggling with breakouts. I did use Proactive before, but it was no longer working for me.  I researched a couple of different brands but a cosmetologist at Ulta recommended this starter kit. After the first week I could already tell a difference!!  I was getting at least 2 pimples a week, but that first week I had nothing and it cleared the ones I had gotten the week before.The only drawback is the price of the entire set, but it is definitely worth it for me."
B00JAOUJ76," My sister has always had skin problems,  I bought her this soap and it has seriously been a miracle for her!  She still has some healing to do, but it has made a hig difference. Thank you! I absolutely LOVE IT. I usually don’t get reviews or detailed ones. But this is honestly great. I have never used a bar soap for face wash but I know turmeric is great for skin. All I can say is my face is clear as hell, soft, and the dark spots are clearing. Turmeric helps with that. At first I was skeptical not gonna lie cause it left a soap scummy feeling on my face. But after I wipe with a paper towel (the roughness of the paper towel helps get off the rest of the dead and dirty skin) my skins soft. I’ve been using it for a month now! I only use it on my face chest and back because I get acne there too. I didn’t have really bad acne before but it was hard for me to find a product that continuously worked. So I love it!!! The photos I uploaded are before and after. I have one no makeup on my skin. I use coconut oil as moisturizer. This soap is great! My wife has had a rash for a while. Doctor gave her ointment which couldn't get rid of it. In two days of use with this soap rash was completely GONE! We couldn't believe it. It also has a very nice aroma. Kind of like sandlewood..It is not cheap but it is worth the money in our opinion. If anyone has read my past reviews I have no problem blasting a bad product or praising a good one. This is a good one! This is the best soap I have ever experienced.  It lathers so quickly, feels so gentle on my skin, and looks so clean when I rinse it off.  I don't think I'll ever use any soap but Vi-tae Coconut Oil Soap.  I would highly, loudly, vigorously recommend this soap to everyone, young and old, male and female.  I am 71 y.o. and my skin has not looked better. Good one but need to use cream after it make ur face dry ^^ Got this to decrease irritation I was getting on my face from bacteria - this really seems to help.  I love that it's anti-bacterial, but won't aid in the next big resistant superbug... This soap is amazing. It makes you feel wonderfully clean and does not dry your skin out.  It foams up enough, you can actually shave with it! The smell is also very pleasing. I do wish the bar was a bit bigger. Follow the companies instructions and it will last you longer. Vi-tae has fantastic products and they are a great company, with great customer service. Thank you Vi-tae❤ The 'Best' by far Face Soap ever used! Bought for my  my grandson (nearly 15) uses it daily and Everyone at school & home noticed an amazing improvement within 2 days and his mom (my daughter) who has been buying top of the line / hand made soaps for years told me this is one of the BEST quality soaps she has ever had. She is so impressed she told me she will buy it herself for now on! also bought Eczema for my 7 yr. old granddaughter and loves it. Defiantly would purchase again and would recommended to anyone looking for a quality skin care face or body soap. I was a bit nervous about using a product that was unfamiliar to me. But I decided to purchase this item about three weeks ago because it reflected strong reviews. I must say, the reviews are true. This is a wonderful product!! I have already recommended it to both my sister and best friend.I do not have bad skin or acne, but a few weeks prior to this purchase, my skin felt dry and dirty. In three weeks, my face feels and looks amazing! I also purchase the African Black soap. I have not used it yet. But I will be sure to port the results as soon as I do. :-) This product is amazing!!!  I purchased this soap for my 9 month old who has ringworm. I wanted something gentle and chemical free for her delicate skin and within the first couple uses I saw a huge difference on the affected area.  This product is wonderful and I highly recommend it. I am always skeptical about the actual quality and benefits of products for the skin and body, however this soap is a keeper. Lathers up easily with a simple ""clean"" scent and rinses cleanly and easily and is not drying to the skin. A hard soap that should last awhile (I hope) to justify the cost. Time will tell. It left my skin feeling so refreshed. This is my 4th day using this product and I already see a difference in my skin. I will definitely be ordering more and giving away as gifts. This soap is totally a godsend...My husband has struggled with chronic athlete's foot for almost a year.We have tried sprays, powders, ointments, even prescription medication.Nothing worked until we purchased this soap.We will save so much money, no more purchasing new shoes, socks, sheets etc because of the smell.On top of working,.. it smells amazing.It smells like eucalyptus and peppermint and it has an amazing lather, and no residue.Just pure, clean feet.Will definitely be purchasing again! Love thi soap.  It instantly clears my problem spot. I have very sensitive skin (hands and feet) whenever I wash my hands, I get water stains and rash like ringworm, very itchy.  Once I started using this soap, it stoped itchy.  I just cut a little slice and store the rest for later use, it works very well.  You don't need a lot and it lather well.  The best product I ever bought.  Can you also recommend something for dried skin? I am so thrilled with this product.  I have really dry skin and this leaves my skin feeling well moisturized.  I definitely recommend this to anyone with skin problems.  Thank you. I was looking for something that would leave me feeling clean but also be gentle on my skin. My hands are dry in general and are especially bad during the winter, leading to skin irritation. Using regular soaps just made the situation worse. This soap (along with a non-soap hand cleanser for sink use) does the trick. I like that the Vi-Tae soap lathers up real well and also has a decent, mild scent. I'm going to continue to use this as my regular soap from here on out, with the exception of occasionally trying other Vi-Tae products. I am very happy with this product. I got it for the all around health of my skin. It cleans really well but it does not dry out your skin and it has a nice light scent. I had an area on my upper arm that looked like a rash developing very slowly over a few months. I was about to set an appt. with a dermatologist but after a few uses of the seaweed soap it had started to vanish. After 2 weeks it's gone. I'm actually amazed this happened. More expensive than regular soap but worth every penny. This honestly is the BEST cleanser EVER! It's amazing for any skin type from oily to dry to sensitive and so on. This works great on my eczema. It makes my face feel squeaky clean and removes make-up in a jiffy! You just need a little bit to lather. It lathers up real well. This has improved my acne too! I've seen less and less pimples when I started to use this bar soap. This bar is full of good for you ingredients! I use this, the Vitamin C bar soap and my Clarisonic Mia 2 to remove my makeup effectively. This products is amazing! I love this soap and it clears my skin like nothing else. I am battling exposure to toxic mold in our house and are in the process of remediation in the soap is great! Been using it for about two weeks now and it's almost completely eliminated the scaling/cracked skin on my elbows and knees. WOW! AMAZING people here! They really do care about their customers! Thats HUGE! Thats more important than the product itself!Got this soap for my mom. Dont know for sure if it works, but its organic and feels SUPER silky. I assume this is the ""healthy"" way to soap your hands? Maybe. Will see. I am hopeful for my mom. But I already see a few negative reviews here and I dont get it. Some products work. Some dont. Thats a universal truth for any product. We all want something to work as described, but CUSTOMER SERVICE SHOULD ALWAYS WORK!You can notice this very clearly when you contact them. They are very responsive and they really want to be there for you. Just reading about their president Elizabeth Robinson, makes me feel like she stands behind her company 100%. But the TRUE TEST is the process that takes place when you are unhappy. Your purchase is completely PROTECTED by Vi-Tae AND Amazon. So if you have any issues with the product, go contact their team and TEST them?! They are totally friendly! They really do appreciate your business and your support.I have had no issues yet, but my interaction with them has been awesome! Will see how this soap works out, but they have been really nice answering all my questions. Therefore, I am confident if something happens, they will be there for me. Otherwise, I will need to change my review to ZERO STARS!THANK YOU GUYS! It smells very good and the clean feeling that it leaves your skin. WowI have really deep pot hole marks from cystic acne. I have used bar for 3 days and huge improvement. I've tried lasers endless acne products vitamins and in 3 days this is working for me. One mark is almost completely gone. This soap works wonders!! I like the fact that this soap is all natural, made with minimal ingredients, and made in the US. The scent is not overbearing at all and the lather washes away clean. I've only been using for a couple weeks so I can't say that I have noticed any major differences in my skin but I feel confident knowing I'm using something on my skin (and on my kids skin) that is pure, all natural, and made with organic ingredients! Good soap I just purchased this for the second time - the first time I received the product with a discount and the second purchase was because I can't live without it! Seller is super customer service oriented also and follows up with emails making sure you are happy and with tips for the product. I bought this soap,because a leg rash appeared this summer. It worked very good. No more itching or red area.I think the natural ingredients make the skin feel better and real clean. Soap has imperceptible odor. I think is a good product for all occasions. Superior soaps.  I've tried a great many through Amazon, Mom's Organic Market, and Whole Foods, and this soap is the best.  It's long-lasting, actually lathered very well (most naturally-made soaps do not), and--most importantly--leaves my very-sensitive skin smooth, unscented, moisturized, and not irritated. This is a great soap in general -- creamy, nice-smelling, and giving a good squeaky-clean feeling after rinsing while still leaving skin feeling soft.  It is also good for  different kinds of skin problems ...!  I am familiar with neem oil and was concerned that this soap would smell like the oil, but it really doesn't at all.  It has a clean and refreshing scent..  Very pleased with this product, and I believe I'm on my third order ...! I've bought this twice now. Really has helped my skin. I'm prone to adult acne (PCOS) and I have dry/scaly skin. My sister has also been using this product for her back acne. In three usages we've notice a huge difference on her back I have been using this soap for a little under a week and within 2-3days the rash I had was completley soothed and gone. It also unexpectedly worked wonders on my acne. I am pleasantly surprised by this little powerful bar of soap and I will be ordering more to keep as a staple. My skin has been blemish free, smooth, and glowing since I've started using this product. Very nice soap. Skin is really soft and silky after use. The fact that this soap is 100% natural organic makes is safe for me to use; it causes no break-out on my sensitive facial skin. The scent is inviting and strong, that is, if herbal turmeric fragrance is a preference. My skin is beginning to feel smooth and somewhat clearer as I have problem acne skin, I use it twice daily; need to continue using it consistently at least for a month to see greater results. I would certainly recommend for safe use. I have used it just a few times but already can see the difference. Thank you. I buy this soap all the time, it is the only thing I use on my super dry, sensitive, aging skin.  It keeps you soft, acne free and no residue! I have recommended it to many people and everyone has loved it as well.  It is all about the NEEM! This is an awesome soap! I'm 31 and have had problem skin after having my last child. Not anymore! No more breakouts, blackheads and my large pores have started shrinking. Kind of pricey but I will buy again and haven't taken advantage of the coupon they send with the soap. This bar of soap is amazing! The price might deter some people away, but it is definitely worth it. This bar of soap is far superior to any I've used in the past. The bar leaves my skin feeling refreshed and actually clean, and the odor is nice as well. And, as advertised, just a minuscule amount of this soap is enough to clean your entire body. If you have any doubts, don't! You won't regret buying this bar of soap. I had moderate acne and light scars.it has improve my acne within just a few weeks of use and haven't had anymore breakouts! My face is clear again and the scars and getting better but will need more time to see drastic results..very happy and will buy again Great great fantastic so thank you for your great company and you're great products I will be ordering from you guys all the time absolutely wonderful for my skin I work construction for 27 years it's the first time I've ever had beauty products in my life since I had the Amazon membership God and Jesus bless you and your families I will order from you guys all the time sincerely Debbie h This product is magically wonderful, I've had acne for the past 15 years of my life. For the first time since i have an acne free face. It's worth every penny.Thank you Vi-Tae. I bought the Get Lathered Up! Lavender soap. Recently I've purchased a few different organic lavender soaps; however, this soap is my favorite. It's got a great smell without being overpowering. It leaves me feeling clean without drying out my skin. And it lathers well. All of the other lavender soaps I've tried just don't lather well. So happy I stumbled across this product and this company on Amazon! I love the organic Cellulite soap. I have seen results on my thighs within three weeks in using it. The main thing that I love is that is lathers so well and your skin is so smooth and silky. I just love this soap. Thank you again. Maria I had been looking for something to wash my face with that didn't cost an arm and a leg and was really good.  This is it!!  I've tried several products - some very expensive ones and some less expensive.  The expensive ones worked fine, but it just seemed wrong to pay so much just to take care of my skin. I love this soap.  It's gentle, it smells good and it WORKS!!!  I love the way my skin feels. Thanks Vi-Tae!!! This purchase came with an extensive 'how to' about using soap--????  I laughed but read it anyway.  The main gist was lather up and leave it on your skin for 10-30 seconds because of patchouli's healing properties.  Damned if they weren't absolutely correct.  I felt very clean and very soft afterwards.  I will order this again. Excellent soap thank you !!! I enjoy using this soap (African Black and the Seaweed Soap) and will keep it as one of my regular soaps. It lathers well, makes me feel very clean, and has a nice, gentle scent. It does not dissolve too quickly if left to drain well. I have tried two only, but am curios about the others and will likely try at least a few more. This is great soap.  I have extremely cracked and peeling skin and regular soap products frequently sting and burn but this soap feels great without any burning and helps control the dryness.  I use it on both my hands and face where I have the worst eczema and after a couple weeks I can see a difference with less shedding/peeling skin.  It is mild enough to use on your face (I avoid the eye area) with no irritation even though I have very sensitive skin.  Will be the only soap product I use in the shower from now on! I ordered this for my wife who suffers from dry skin.  She says this is the only treatment that has ever helped.  Her hands are almost back to normal. I use it too,  The winter air is very dry here in Minnesota. The sellers of this product have been very supportive.  This is a strong 5 star recommendation. These folks know how to make a great soap.  This one is wonderful in every aspect!  Right out of the box, the aroma is a light, delicate, delectably fresh citrus (the ingredient label lists at least 4 different citrus oils).  It produces an exceptionally creamy lather--- instantly.  Best of all, this soap is non-drying and non-irritating to my highly sensitive skin.  So glad I ordered it!  A daily delight to use. Excellent for minor rashes I love this soap, I would definitely recommend buying it. It makes my skin really soft, and it also helped me with the eczema I have on my hands. Well, I wanted to wait a while just to be sure on the results. After using prescription medication from the doctor that just seemed to barely maintain my eczema under control, I just want to say thank you so much for your product. I tried it not expecting such great results. Didn't want to get my hopes up. I no longer wake up in the middle of the night scratching my skin to the point of it bleeding a bit or even during while I'm half asleep. My days are much more enjoyable. I noticed a difference after the first use as well. My marks are fading away more and more each day. Some people say the price is high, but personally (and this is someone who is frugal) I think it is well worth the price. Pay the price or deal with constant itching and scratching? I'll pay the price. Again thank you so much. I will be ordering again soon. I purchased specifically to help with foot odor! I am on my feet for 10 hours a day 5 times a week and I read that if you use anti bacteria soap it helps prevent odor. I have never used this type of soap before and was a bit skeptical but was willing to give it a try. I am really impressed with the results and it gives a mild lavender scent on the skin. It is now my only daily body soap! This is great stuff!! Smells great and leaves my skin feeling so refreshed and clean. I work outdoors in a humid climate and I will buy so much more of this product (and others from Vi-Tae). I'm recommending it to my friends and family, and especially my co-workers. I truly can't put into words how much I love it. I can't see or understand how anyone could be disappointed!! Best organic soap I found that has natural anti-bacterial properties. I was using BASIS All Clear earlier but its production was stopped and also it was with triclosan ( an effective antibacterial agent but still a chemical !)Pro:  All natural, organic soap, no chemicalsCon: Expensive , doesn't last long I have eczema and I love this soap! No irritation. Lathers up pretty well. I also use a shea butter lotion and my skin has never been happier. This soap is incredibly nice!  It's my first, but far from the last, purchase from this new company.I bought it via Amazon when I was in Phoenix recently, before returning to Belize where I live for most of the year now.  I take a lot of showers here in the heat and humidity and am happy to say that the bar of soap is still almost as big as it was when I opened it!! this stuff actually works! This soap is very good. I had very itchy feet and tried different things to alleviate the itch and burn. The first time I used this on my feet, the itching and burning stopped. My feet thoroughly dried and there was no return symptoms. I continued to use it and my feet has soften and no cracked dry skin.  Smells very good, not like other antifungal washes. This is a excellent product.  It gets the job done. Wonderful! It's worth every penny! I will be ordering this for now on :).Thank the Lord for this amazing pure organic,and, gentle,Soap. Excellent results adding Vi-Tae organic psoriasis soap to my treatment routine.  Lathers well, and if you leave on for a few minutes helps soothe the redness and itching.  Have used daily for about 2 weeks and still have almost half a bar left.  May be a bit expensive but I'm convinced it helps.  Plan to order again. For my son. Great soap, Helped in clearing up my allergic dermatitis  which was caused by washing my hands to much and with the wrong soap, even some other hand soaps I tried that reviewers said didn't dry or make their hands itchy.  I also used  some other anti itch preparations along with this soap.  Only down size is the cost. Wish It was less expense. Love this soap! It smells nice and is gentle but cleans well. Grrrt product 👍👍👍 My husband and I we use this soap everyday. It is very refreshing and midly perfumed. Feels great on the skin. It works well if you follow the directions provided in the email. I will be reordering this item may around the end of this month. My only wish would be if it was priced a little less. Not everyone can afford $11 per soap bar. very nice great price very good Awesome Thanks! Works great on body and face! I like it . I haven't used it quite long enough to tell if it helping completely. It does seem to be helping . I leave it on for at least 30 sec after I apply the lather . It lathers real good.No scent what so ever. I wish it had a nice smell like lemongrass or lavender or even tea tree.It is pricey though. I have only been using a couple of weeks but it seems to be helping.  The dryness from the eczema is much better. Best anti bacterial soap. Smells good and feels good. Wish it were a little cheaper though the bars are pretty small Amazing product ordering more ok stuff Got this on a lightning deal, decided to split the bar so everyone could use it for the ice but LUV it for the shower too. no residue feeling , great for the face in this humidity I like this one better than the neem soap.  I ordered the neem soap first I loved how soft it made my skin; I don't use it on my face, because my skin on my face is so sensitive.  I did try and it left give like bumps on my face.  So I tried the Papaya soap, and it was better than the neem.  My skin was glowing and soft.  I was able to use it on my face. For anyone who has issues with skin sensitivity, psoriasis, eczema, or other, this is a great soap.  What differentiates it from so many others is that it lathers and has a wonderful subtle pleasant aroma too.  It lasts a long time and unlike many soaps, calms the skin.  It does not leave skin dry and protects injured skin in the healing process. My husband has Guttate and Plaque Psoriasis over most of this body, desperate for some relief I ordered him this soap. It has a pleasant smell and is not irritating to the skin. It did not provide any relief that we could note, however, it did not cause any  further irritation. It is a but pricey, but natural and pleasant. It can be challenging to find quality soap that is affordable and also addresses your skincare needs-look no further! This soap meets it for psoriasis&eczema. It's all made in the USA, and very gentle and good on the skin - and I will be purchasing a few more on my next purchase. Highly recommend it! Great soap!  I have been dealing with sensitive shin all my 60 years.  Sulphur soap helped, but does not compare to the luxurious feeling and wonderful scent of Vi-Tae's Seaweed soap.  Now I'm not always touching here and there to stop itch.  It's GREAT!  Sure am glad I tried this soap. I'm an extremely satisfied customer! So much so I will continue to buy this product for a lifetime. It's too bad they don't sell it in bulk (you guys should though, I'd be purchasing more if that were the case). I've been using Vi-Tae Organic Tea Tree Oil for over half a year and it's THE only product my sensitive skin can handle. I use this product for my entire body and it's been great! I've even purchased some for my 2 year old goddaughter who also has sensitive skin, not to mention my preteen niece who is starting to break out on her face. She's using it and she loves it because it's starting to clear up her face and eliminates the redness of breaking out. After trying so many different acne clearing soaps, I found one that actually works. It keeps the acne away, evens and tones the skin too. The bar lasts a long time as long as you keep it away from water when you are not using it so that it doesn't waste. It doesn't have a strong scent but it does smell good. Highly recommend this. I bought this as I was preparing for surgery and needed anti-bacterial soap. Loved the smell-kind of lemony. Suds really nicely. The only thing I didn't like is that it is a bit drying to the skin but I think that is normal with any anti-bacterial soap since there aren't any lotions in them. I have dry skin to begin with. I did love the smell and the price. Smells nice, feels clean, like it for underarms & smelly feet I have had a lot of skin issues since I had chemo. I must be very particular about what goes on my skin. With a deep breath, I took a chance and bought the soap. It has been wonderful! My skin does not sting, and I feel clean and fresh after use. I'm anxious to try some of the other types of soap you have. Thank you so much. Awesome soap with a nice earthy smell. I definitely Recommend! It Makes your skin feel clean and tight after use. Lovely organic coconut oil soap! I have ordered these bars three times already. They make my skin nice and soft. And moisturizes my skin so well. I am very pleased to have found these bars on amazon.com. I researched many bars of soap and these are my favorite..May, 2016. I give these Coconut 100% bars of soap a five star feedback. I am not soap person. I always used cleanser for my face. But this one is amazing. I wanted to try organic, less chemical cleanser for face so I did amazon search and purchases this soap. It lathers so quickly, feels so gentle, smells good, and cleanse well. I've been buying this as a gift. Hight recommend it!! I have tried a number of natural and organic soaps and this soap is one of the best!  It has a great smell that isn't overpowering.  My skin feels smooth and soft after using it but still feels very clean.  The key ingredients in this soap are really beneficial too!  I will definitely be purchasing this again! i have been using this product for several weeks now and i'm liking the results. this product is helping with the extreme itching on my arms and hands.  also i had a rash near my underarms and it has helped with clearing it up.  i would recommend this product.  don't except immediate results but with constant use i have seen improvement. I love the Vi-Tae line but especially this one. I have Eczema and at last I believe that I have found the one that helps me the most. But must also add that all of their soaps are top of the line in my book.. I bought the soap for my granddaughter for a skin problem.  She has been using it for three weeks and is over the moon happy.  I'll be buying again and again. This soap was recommended before surgery. It proved to be very effective and has a pleasant aroma as well. Smells great, not irritating and my skin loves it! Most soap irritate my skin. I have very sensitive skin and this soap is awesome for my skin, without drying it out and without all the dyes and fragrances. my favorite is the  SEAWEED SOAP. It smells amazing and make us feel good about what we are putting on our skin.  Natural exfolliant.We love that they don't contain any toxic or ""filler"" ingredients and are safe for the whole family. We are so grateful we found them. The best soap I have. Looking forward to buying more. I purchased this soap for my 88 year old mother who is having a horrible time with eczema. She LOVES this soap! She said it felt so good that she wanted to stay in the shower because it gave her such great relief. She has very short hair and used it as a shampoo too! I've purchase a second time and will continue to buy this product for my mom. My son is 14 and he has very bad acne and this is the only soap that help his face Amazing soap🌹  I was hesitant to use on my face because my skin is very sensitive and I usually follow up with a toner. However, I find that I can eliminate my toner and just apply my moisturizer. Needless to say the soap gently cleanses my entire body. No residual tightness or itchiness. Thank you for a find produce. 🌹 Love this soap! I can't believe how clean my skin feels after using it. My face is literally squeaky clean. What I like most is that it cleans without drying my skin out. Will definitely buy this soap again. It hasn't cured my excema on my face but it is really helping soothe the itching so far. This Goats Milk Soap is the best soap EVER!!! I have sensitive skin; skin that has the ability to get itchy and ashy very easily. This soap takes care of all of that and more. Leaves my skin soft, clear, and refreshed. Truly a blessing and it's all natural- What more could you ask for?? The soap is amazing.  I love It!  It lathers beautifully and is mildly scented with a  very soft calming scent.  Best of all it leaves my face super clean and smooth, not at all tight!  I love that it is all natural as well, which is very hard to find!  Highly recommend for all types of skin! I don't do reviews, but this one I will do. I've tried every cleaning method there is for my very sensitive skin. You will not do better than this bar of shea butter. My dry skin and dermatitis are finally O.K.  And using this bar to get those results is truly heaven in the shower. I'm not one to leave reviews but so far this soap has made a HUGE difference for me. I'm super sensitive & have developed psoriasis that presents differently over my body. I get very bad cystic breakouts on my rear end & nothing has helped for 20+ years. I usually react to most products with major rashes & itchiness. I have tried everything from hippie soaps to Dermalogica to other even more expensive remedies.Within two days of using this product, my cystic acne started clearing up & I didn't get a rash from it either which is very common for me. I have a long way to go but I'm loving my results so far. Also my keratosis pilaris (small bumps on back of upper arms) is almost unnoticeable.I have a friend who has had a problem with cystic acne on her face for many years & I already recommended she try this & she ordered it right away. I can't wait to hear from her how it is going.As soon as I'm done typing here, I'm ordering more so I don't run out!!! Bought for my husband and he loves it.  Like the smell and how it makes his face feel. love the scent and the soap and will definitley be getting more.  it seemed to not last very long, relative to others i've used (and I've used a lot of different kinds).  but, i love the natural ingredients and the scent.  will be reordering promptly and regularly This soap was recommend by a friend of mine that's a nurse and I love it; great scent and it is wonderfully moisturizing. High recommend. I have been using the soap for about three weeks and love it.  I lathers us easily and provides a good cleansing for me.  I decided to use a product such as this one to reduce the amount of estrogen-like substances that are in my environment.  This soap allows to move to that environment. My son developed a cracked skin allergy between his fingers. The Dermotologist gave him something to strong and made it worse. This soap soothes his hands and is not irritating . Still trying to figure out the cause of allergy, but this soap and all the products have been really fantastic. Big fan of this soap- great scent, a little goes a long way, and most importantly has kept my skin clear. I have relatively clear skin but have always been prone to a big ugly blemish (often monthly)- haven't experienced that since I start using this soap, and also seems my pores are smaller as well. First product have ever used, where a visible difference, back top of my tights , is visable! Tried many products n my 58 yrs , w no success, never dreamed a soap would smooth out my skin so well. Thank u for a great product, we'll always be part of my skin routine now!! Gentle The ANTIFUNGALl soap helps to rid your body of fungus on the areas you are treating.  It has a pleasant smell and easy to use when showering or bathing.  It lathers up as soon as you apply it to your skin and rinses off without leaving any residue on your skin.  I highly recommend this ANTIFUNGAL if you need to treat fungus. Love this soap. I am a school custodian ,and having psoriasis , is not a good combination. This soap makes my hands so soft yet gentle enough that doesn't cause my psoriasis to flare Wonderful, fully organgic product that smells amazing and does not dry out my skin. I will be repurchasing once mine is all gone ! I have tried this papaya soap for more than a week and i'm satisfied with the results.My skin is clear of impurities. I was a little bit skeptical at first about how the soap would soap and bubble up, but it did! The smell is kind of like pine cones (which I personally like) and lasts a long time. It's just like any other bar soap, only gentler and little bit pricier but I personally feel like its worth it!! I love this! Good soap. Washes off well. The scent is strong and lasts a long time. I'm happy with it, I would buy again and would try some other scents. I like the feel of this soap. It has a light creamy feel to it. Lots of lather and no fragrance. Afterwards my skin felt smooth and clean. There was no soap residue. Very good product. My face felt great immediately after use. Within a few days most of my overly dry and overly oily spots normalized. I love the texture and smell of the bar. I live in a low humidity area and usually slather up lotion after a shower. After using this bar my skin feels clean and not dried out. I now use much less lotion. Amazing inexpensive all Natural remedy for my family and dog pets! The medicinal property of the tea tree oil is super beneficial for cleansing yet moisturizing our sensitive dry skin and treating minor skin irritations/fungal. Also gentle and effective in our dogs flea bath treatment!!! Thank you so much! I have been using this soap since the beginning of February. I can honestly say this soap does not dry my skin. This is important living in Southern California. It feels creamy. Faint smell of coconut. My skin doesn't feel or look dry after using it. I recommend this product. I will most definitely order again. I love the way this soap feels on my skin. It does not leave a residue, but moisturizes nicely. I love this item I'm 50yrs old. I purchased this soap for a jock itch problem that was not totally resolved with jock itch spray formulas. To my amazement...IN ONE WEEK; NO MORE JOCK ITCH AT ALL after implementing this soap!!! - and, my inflamed skin has disapated completely. I am beyond pleasantly amazed but...I'm not done yet; I have been fighting with adult acne and facial scars for over ten years now with an array of actions taken; from doctors to medications with intermittent to mediocre results. This soap has GREATLY reduced my acne and completely removed the inflammation and scars from the cystic acne I was getting. The current cystic acne is practically 90% GONE IN ONE WEEK!!!  --- I no longer use any other soap for hands or face when I'm home except this Vi-Tae Organic Anti Fungal Soap. The quick forming lather is awesome, which rinses off without a film greasy feel on your skin and, the aroma is enticing and soft but not fruity - so your manhood is in tact. Best neem soap I've found to date. The most fragrant soap ever ! A luxury item that I would like to be able to afford more often. I love it even more than my 100% olive from Provence ! Cleans and smells so good when using it  !I will definitely add this to my must have list !!! This is simply amazing. Cleared my acne within days and I couldn't be happier. Paired this off with a serum, clear skin for weeks. Way better than the store cleanser or anything else in my opinion. Combined with use of %100 tea tree oil and coconut oil after has compleatly rid my face of whitehead breakout on chin! So happy buying one for gym bag!!! Great soap! Love the smell and the freshness.Looking forward to try all the variety.I use it according to the guidelines given by the company. And, it lasts at least 2 months.Big supporter of Organic and Vegan product!! Have already reordered this product. Rinsed off really nice. No soapy feel. Love this soap.  I lather it up on my face and leave it on while I shower.  The dryness and red spots on my face are greatly diminished! This soap lathers well and does not dry out the skin at all. No particular smell. However, I've just started using the product (currently towards the end of first bar) so I plan to keep using it to see if it makes any visible change in my skin tone. I'll update the review over time. So far, I'm loving it. I'm simplifying my 'shower' and this bar has become my one & only.  Meaning, skin AND hair. I'll alternate between the lavender and the coconut oil bars, I love them both.  I think the coconut oil allows it to be multi-use, and I love the feeling and the smell. good stuff, some sea weeds are good for the body and joint pain like irish sea moss and that is why i bought it. I have used many different products. For my dry skin condition nothing has worked as well as Vi-Tae anti fungal soap great lather and smell .My skin is clear after using your soap for a month.I will continue using your product as it by far the best for my condition thank you  Alan V Natural black soap seems to work as well if not better but it's ok, send to be good quality I love this soap. I have a very sensitive skin. I'm very allergic to dust and gets my skin very dry and itchy. Been using this soap for couple of weeks and seen that my scars from scratching lightened! Will continue using this and considering as my #1 bar soap! I really love this soap it makes my skin so soft and smooth. Although the price is a bit steep I will definitely be purchasing again! I'm hooked on this soap and will order more.  Skin feels soft and clean.  Smells wonderful.  It is a little messy in the soap dish and will stain white wash clothes.  I use dark colored clothes now and so happy I found this soap. Nice purchase I like it it has a nice clean smell rinses off clean leaving your skin soft and silky This stuff is superb! Its clearing up my face so wellwell. I can't be without it. I have to buy 2 bottles at a time because I  wont be caught without it! The coconut oil soap arrived yesterday as promised. I was amazed at how mush lather it produced and good it smelled. I normally have dry sky after a shower but that was not the case after using this product. It left my skin soft an lightly scented. Would recommend and definitely buy again. Vi-Tae Organic Oatmeal Spice Soap is great, the smell is amazing and its great on the skin. I have given up on bottle shower scrubs, the difference is dramatic. I won't go back to the chemicals, give me the natural soaps please. I love Vi-Tae! I've been looking for an organic, bath bar that's doesn't feel oily or leave a residue. I love the variety of mild scents and am definitely going to try more. Also going to explore more items from the line like, salt scrubs and deodorants. Pleased with. Product I have a lot of red in my face, so I tend to wear a lot of foundation to try to cover it, after using this soap on my face for a week most of the redness is gone. will continue to use this soap.  I also like the smell of it. I absolutely love this soap.  My face and body feels so  - so clean.  No soapy film.  I will definitely keep buying from you.  I am not very good at explaining my feeling to anyone, but I have no itchy dryness after using COCONUT OIL SOAP. I am so glad I found your item on Amazon. Makes my skin feel clean! Different clean from the commercial soap...great for kids with sensitive skin...I will definitely buy more. This product helped my Mom's eczema! Thank you so much for the Certified Organic GOAT MILK Soap. It is gentle, and it soothes her skin. Excellent I have very dry, sensitive skin, and this soap doesn't irritate it at all. Lovely product. Seemed to give some relief of itching and irritation caused by poison ivy.  I applied bactine and prescription cortisone cream after - these two things were not as effective by themselves.  I like the smell and it seems like a nice soap in general. I am impressed with this soap and the excellent customer service provided by the company. It lathers and is such a beautiful scent that stays all day. Plus my bathroom smells delightful all day. Great soap I like how it may my skin feel so soft and smooth I'm also starting to see the cellulite leaving my body thank you for making this I will be buying it again when I need to replace it. My husband absolutely loved this product, he was about to give up on the natural soaps, when I found this one and asked him to try it. He loves the way it lathers up and makes you feel so clean. Truly he really really likes this soap. Thanks so much. I have sensitive skin and this soap didn't irritate it. It has a mild scent that goes away shortly after you get out of the shower, so even if the scent isn't something you really like it fades quickly to nothing, which is nice. I would repurchase and recommend it. =] This is the best soap I have ever used but recently when I tried to reorder it, it was not available. This thing works, feels and smells great! great soap makes you feel squeaky clean. Love how my skin feel...will buy again This product is amazing! I've tried all types of soaps to help clear my skin of blemishes & so far this one has shown the best results. My skin feels so clean & smooth, the soap also smells amazing too. Great product, definitely works well with my sensitive skin and almost instantly cleared up a rash that i previously had Soap is great--but way too pricey. I won't be purchasing again--thought I was getting more than 1 bar for $11. Definitely met expectations and exceeded them. Excellent.  Feels and lathers great.  I wanted an antibacterial, gentle to my skin, not harmful, not bad smelling, ORGANIC soap.  I finally found it and I am satisfied.  I highly recommend this product!!! I like this lavender soap because after I washed my face,my face feel clean and not dry.I have rash on my cheeks and I only use for three days,my rash seems like not that red now.I will order again soon. Great soap This soap not only smells really good but it also healed all the itching i was having on my back!  True story!  The itching i had been having for months just stopped after the first time i used this soap! My husband did like it. Although the fragrance wasn't lasting on the soup which it makes sense if it is all natural, he did enjoy it. Highly recommend it especially for dry skin. Very nice, creamy lather. Does not dry out or irritate my sensitive skin. Long lasting too which was a good surprise. Will buy again although I wish it was a little cheaper. Works great and keeps my eczema flares down. I am allergic to almost everything and this does not have a real fragrance to it but I definitely feel clean when I am done showering. Def recommend. Love this product and will be ordering again. Great product!  I had a rash that could not be cured with prescription creams.  After using Tea Tree Oil Soap by Vi Tae, it was much improved in 2 days!  The rash is completely gone, but I continue to use the soap. This is a great product especially for sensitive skin.  It lathers up nicely and feels very soothing.  I will buy this again.  The company is very customer oriented and truly cares about what you think about their product. I absolutely love this soap.it has a very clean scent and rinses off leaving no residue.  Leaves the skin soft......even the elbows. I will definitely be a repeat customer . A friend recommended I use neem for my son's acne. This soap has helped tremendously with his overall complexion. He still gets the occasional break out but they are less severe. Wonderdul!!! I have extremely sensitive skin and this soap is perfect for me. I love this soap. I have been using it for about a year. I leaves my face feeing clean and refreshed, not dry, not oily, but just right. I have always some blemishes, but it has cleared them up too! Love this papaya soap... my skin was so smooth and has been clearing up since I had a skin situation that left me with scars. My skin is now noticeably brighter. It's antibacterial,  fragrance free,  and lathers wonderfully! I got it to prep for a surgery and loved it so much that it's become my daily soap! Great product! Love it! The soap has a pleasant fragrance. I love how my skin feels cool and refreshed after using. I dont have psoriasis but do have dry patching skin on my arms. The product has made my skin feel and look better. I love this product. It reduced some of my skin problem like dark spots on my face cause of pimples, I recommend this product because it helps and this has a natural ingredients. I waited to review this product, it's been almost a month of me using this product and I love it!!! Ithe smells amazing and I feel clean, and I noticed my skin getting lighter...so happy! This soap is amazing I use it for my face  and help out with the extra oil on my face. Great soap and made my skin very soft.....I even used it on my hair and it gave it lots of body....This is wonderful PURE soap and I even washed my hair with it too...!!! It had been under a week that I am using this product  I hope it will work in the long run for now i can say it is smooth and pleasantly scented  I am impressed with the sellers mannerism , wonderful aroma, long lasting, fresh Got this for my 13 year old.. He has some mild acne starting.. He really liked the soap and it seems to be helping clear up his acne... I like that the product is easy and natural. Purchased this soap to help with my sons Molluscum contagiosum and within two weeks his skin was clear. Smells amazing and no problems with shipping. Will keep using this on all my children. Thank you This product works well.  I have tried other antibacterial soaps and they either smelled bad or they stained everything green.  This product works and has a great scent. Tried this for a scalp treatment for psoriasis and so far so good. A little goes a long way, and it will definitely clean your hair & scalp. It has worked great for this and cut down on the itching. I could not be happier with this product! It has quickly settled an angry outbreak of eczema. I will be buying this over and over again as nothing has worked as well for me! Thank you! It is fantastic! It really lathers up yet it didn't try out my skin at all. I use it as an full body soap and so far so good. I also liked the recyclable packaging. I love this product. Purchased first bar of soap and its done just what u needed it to. I ordered an addition shipment of 6 bars taking great advantage of the 25% off promotional offer. Worth the $11 !!! I have uneven skin tone and dark spots from past acne. After a week I saw a difference smoother and lighter skin color evening out finally !!! I will buy this product for a lifetime ! Love this soap! It is great to keep my acne under control. After using it for over a week my face has cleared up and is less oily. Will be purchasing again! I love this soap and have been using it exclusively for probably 2 years or more. My skin is very soft and moisturized with this product. I highly recommend it. I so love this soap... African Black Soap had lovely fragrance in the shower but leaves no fragrance on the skin. excellent lather, silky feel. works great on acne and irritations, yes it’s drying to the skin (that’s the charcoal)we currently use the psoriasis/eczema bar. by far our favorite from Vi-Tae and it works as a shampoo on fine thin hair (not great but better than anything i’ve tried so far. rinse well)The handsoap has wonderful exfoliating benfits but dissolves fastestThe vitC bar smells like fruit loops and apple jacks(have yet to try the others)CONs:Vi-Tae bars dissolve quickly so keep dry I did not give a review until I had some time to see if I got results.  I must say it has almost cleared my skin fungus completely!  I used other products before and it took weeks to get results, but this soap works fast.  This soap has a nice scent and does the job.  I don't know what else to say, but ""for me"" it works fast and I am so glad I found this product. Very happy with this product. I use this product on my face. It lathers easily and doesn't leave my face dry. Great for travel as I don't have to worry about a 3 ounce liquid container. This is a great product but it's very pricey for something that goes quick. Makes my skin feel great but I don't think I can justify this price for how quickly it goes. Lasted about 2 1/2 weeks for me. The best skin care soap out there. This specific soap cleans as it moisturizes your skin leaving it soft and flexible. Get rid of dry  flaky skin with first use and continued use. I use it in the shower daily and am very happy. My skin is sensitive and tends to be dry. This soap has eliminated itchy skin feeling and my skin looks fresher and natural without any residue or greasy after feel. I use a vented soap dish to allow it to dry between uses and it is long lasting. LOVE the Vitamin C Soap!  Makes my skin feel super soft and I love that I'm not using chemicals or toxins to clean my skin. I really like this soap! It works well for me, lathers well, and is effective in it's anti-bacterial properties. This is a great replacement for triclosan, glad I gave it a shot. I see myself being a longtime user. This is a great anti-fungal soap.  I began noticing a difference within a couple of days!  I have ordered more of this to have a supply handy. I bought $12 soap.As much as I beat myself up for buying a $12 bar of soap. I love the product. I suffer from severe eczema in the winter in multiple places of my body. Lotion and Vaseline works to some degree but I always end up using prescription strength usp ointment cream. Since I started using this soap, my itchiness and eczema disappeared like magic. I'm not sure how long I can afford to buy $12 bar of soap for but so far it has been working great for me. Just as expected!! Great product!! Helped with my breakouts and seborrheic dermatitis.  I also enjoy the smell of the tea tree. I bought one to try and liked the result enough to buy a second.  Will be buying again. Great product.  Works better than the medication I got for my skin fungus. Definitely more of a patchouli scent than some others I've tried, which I like!  A little higher-priced than some, but worth it, in my opinion. I love it! It ia the first natural soap that leaves my skin feeling so clean ans soft and flawless! I have less than a week using it and some bumps on my thighs are already gone! I found my new favorite soap! Was just as described! Lg bar, will last quite awhile.. Daughter struggles with acne, this soap has helped tremendously .. plus leaves your skin smooth! Love this soap..cleared up a couple of diffucult areas on my face quickly Great soap, really does what it says it will do. I love this soap This was my first experience with Vi-Tae Coconut Soap and I am truly enjoying it. Unlike other soapsof its ilk it lathers abundantly and quickly leaving skin soft not oily  I will definitely reorder.. I bought the Turmeric soap and I'm absolutely thrilled with it. Helps keep acne away and clear up old discoloration marks. Doesn't dry out my skin either. Great stuff! I really loved this soap.  Not sure how much the anti fungal properties worked but it lathered beautifully.  Just a bit too expensive for my blood. I bought this for my mom and she thoroughly enjoys it! On top of that, the order shipped fast which is always a good thing to me! Great product :) I love natural soaps, I use this on my face and body every day! I also love that it's made in America, great buy Love this product. It really keeps my skin hydrated and soft. I use it and got it for my mom going through radiation to make sure her scar and skin don't dry up. Highly recommend it for any skin type! This soap is smelling soooo good!  It arrived on time and wrapped perfectly.  Lathering is great and I am completely happy with seller! It's a bar of soap and it works. Very Happy excellent product Love the way this natural soap lathers up... true to the name.  Smell very nice too. Smells natural and medicinal. Lasts for 4-6 months depending on usage. Looks natural. Good vibes from using a quality product. i used it for my son ,because he always sweat and smell and it really work well for him .and not just that is organic for him which is a plus, Thank you Once around the sink and fixtures after washing and the day is off to a good start. Neem Soap is wonderful for cleaning also. WORKED EXTREMELY WELL W/ DRY ITCHY SKIN -  DID EVERYTHING AS ADVERTISED So far it's great The eczema/psoriasis symptoms were gone. I wish the soap was cheaper but it was worth every penny. Of course it was just a supplementary component of the tratment. Love this soap it lathers really nice and seems to calm the itch.  I will buy more when I need this is highly recommended in my life. Awesome product. Lathers very well and doesn't smell like 100% Neem. Nice soft smell. Works after one use. I'm a repeat customer. Worth the money I want to buy more."
B0081E70JQ," Use this all the time Absolutely LOVE Roc Good stuff, feels nice. Awesome. Already seeing a difference after a few weeks Works as well or better than Pernox Totally love this sleanser. Back in a day I purchased something similar at TJMaxx, something no-name that was foaming with particals that was cleansing and exfiliating at the same time. And finally I found a comparable replacement. It's a creamy texture, gentle, cleanses well and my face feels baby soft. Nice soft scent too. I would buy it again. My favorite cleanser.  I use it at night to thoroughly clean my face. Does a great job. Gets the job done and has a light fragrance. This is a fabulous face wash. It has granules that are great for removing dead skin cells. Definitely recommend. makes your face so soft Always use love it Officially a believer ! I've heard so much great reviews on this product that I had to try it. Doesn't dry my skin, and I've noticed such a change in my skin's texture. Definitely will buy again Every since I first tried roc 4 month's ago my face hasn't been the same it's like I have my teenage skin back in love it if use the hole line of products This is then Absolute best face wash I've ever used!!!! Doesn't dry my skin out...doesn't make it oily...just leaves it fresh and soft!! I ordered a second tube after finishing the first one. My skin is a bit sensitive but this one works great and after washing, feels very smooth. Very good.  I have used for few years. I love the Roc products! This cleanser is gentle enough to use daily and it smells great. Since I started using these products I've noticed my skin looking brighter, more firm, and less noticeable lines. This is my new favorite face wash.  I have tried several kinds and usually just fall back on Olay.  This is cleansing without being too rough or being too oily. Great facial  wash it's got just a little bit of exfoliation but not too much that you can't use it daily I love anything from the Roc line. Great price. I buy this product often.  I don't know about true anti-aging, but I do like it as a cleanser. Hands down THE BEST. I use it with the Roc undereye cream during the day & then at night wity the roc night time cream. It has made all the difference in my skin. lasted with me about 6 months , i used it every other day  with small amount .no skin irritations or complications. i didn't see any difference form the usual facial cleanser Really like this cleanser. Great price too. perfect Cleans well, you don't need to use much of the product to get a good cleaning. Works as expected. great product, I have seen a difference in my complexion within 2 days.  I would definately tell my friends and family about this. ROC DID A NICE JOB WITH THIS PRODUCT. IT EXFOLIATES VERY NICELY, IMMEDIATE RESULTS, AND KIND TO YOUR SKIN., GOOD PRODUCT I use it every day.  There are very small scrubbers in the cleanser.  It's gentle enough for me to use every day. I Love this, the tiny beads are non irritating and it makes your skin smooth and soft. It only takes a tiny amount so the tube lasts longer than you would expect. This is a great product.  My skin looks and feels very smooth after I use this product. Great product i love this facial cleanser its so great for the price and it works amazing not other cleanser has help me out before, this is like a miracle in a battle i love it. i am only 22 dont get deceive because it says wrinkles... it just works this is an excellent product,I recommend it for all ages.Given time you will see a big improvement in skin tone and ckarity I use practically all the Roc products and love them all. I think this leaves your skin nice and clean without residue LOVE. THIS. STUFF. Love this stuff!  I use it daily.  My face feels clean, fresh and smooth after use. Makes my skin feel great! Love this facial cleanser. Best cleanser I've ever used!  My acne prone skin loves it. I pray they never discontinue this product because I'll probably use it forever. The best facial cleaner I have ever used. Roc products are the best you can buy. Try it you will love it. The only facial wash that works on my super oily skin THIS IS MY ROC! good product Cleans perfectly well without cruelty. Love this product!! It really works. Leaves your skin feeling clean and smoothe. Great does a good job will reorder. Item was as described and works well. Good product. I would purchase this item again when needed in the future. Very, very creamy leaves my face clean, fresh and renewed.Better that other products that I've tried. Not overly ""sandy"". I also ordered the ROC pads Max Resurfacing cleanser in a jar.  These are good products and so far no sensitivities have developed. Excellent Great product I love roc Max, works great. My husband said I was absolutely glowing!  I saw an immediate difference iny skin, especially great for someone who self-tans. One of the best store brand face washes This is a great cleanser. It really takes the make up off and gently exfoliates my skin. Leaving it smooth. I also use the little twirly brush with this product and it really helps. Good facial wash. Skin feels clean. A gift great!! Works great and very affordable! Great stuff These ROC products are the Real Deal, I purchased this Resurfusing Facial wash  to use in conjuction with ROC's Melibiose Firmimg cream. The results are Truly Noticeable. With the wash's minor crystals, you can literally feel your pores breathe with cleanliness, it's almost like getting a mini micro derm abrassion but this one you can do daily...My skin is so touchably soft after and it stays that way too. It's ready for the intake of any nutients you'd want to apply or just for  the softness, tightning and glowing affect after a few minutes of washing it. Thiscame in sooo quickly, I did not expect it for a few more days and it came with a little gift too. The company also sent a trial of dead sea salt mask to try Thanks I love this stuff! I like everything about this product. It feels good on your skin, the small granules takes the dull layer off the skin. My skin is sensitive and I have had no problem at all. This product actually does as it says. I also like Roc Pore Reducer but could not find it on Amazon. Both products do as they say and how many of us can actually say that? I was never a Roc fan until I found the pore Reducer and this one. Try them both. If you have large pores, I swear Roc Pore Reducer does in fact shrink the size to the point that you cannot see them. love this cleaner! leaves face very smooth and soft. i am outside a lot so my skin takes a beating. this is the first time using this product- i'll keep you posted ! Great product! I love RoC, but at times I dread the price tag that goes along with this face wash and RoC products in the grocery store. I decided to order on Amazon to save a couple extra bucks and a trip to the grocery store and I am so happy I did! Who doesn't like using a great product for less money and saving time, money, and gas on ditching the trip to your local store. This cleaner smells so clean and fresh, the micro-beads are perfect for polishing your skin without tearing it's gentle tissue to truly deep cleanse your pores. It is an all in one product that cleans, gently exfoliates, and has anti-aging benefits built in. Wonderful product! This is a nice and affordable facial cleanser. I was actually looking for my Retinol cleanser and found this.  So to be fair while it was not what I was looking for it is a nice product that I would recommend to anyone wishing a nice grainy scrub for deep cleansing. Love it you can see the results in a week I love roc products they work very well awesome stuff I have been using ROC products forever.  This resurfacing facial cleanser first came as a freebie with a night cream.  It is gentle enough to use every day and it makes your face feel clean and smooth.  It has little microcrystals in it that feel like you are getting a mimicrodermabrasion every time you use it. I have a very oily nose which has caused me to have a major problem with blackheads.  The biore nasal strip was making a fortune off of me but no more!  I wash with this daily when I shower and it has all but eliminated my blackhead problem.  I highly recommend this product. Even with my super sensitive skin I am able to use this product and am very happy about it.  Started using RoC in Jan 2014 and wished I had tried sooner.  Within 7 days I could begin to see the vertical smile lines (formerly dimples) plumping out.  Using this scrub, night cream in a jar, sensitive night cream in a tube, day cream in a tube with 30SPF  my entire skin texture is changing.  The pores on chin and nose are slowly getting smaller.  Would recommend to anyone wanting to improve facial texture.  The night cream in a jar has a little more fragrance than the other products but fragrance still not strong.  If you are in your 30' or 40's and suffer from headaches or migraines the night cream may not be for you. This has just a little ""grit"" in it, so when you need a little more exfoliation than cleansing creams provide, this is a good product. So far, so good. Great product!  I leave it in the shower and use it regularly. I have great skin!  Thank you This is a great facial exfoliant. This product is not rough at all and does great on my sensitive skin. I also like the fact that it foams and exfoliates, which I feel like it's hard to find one product that does both. Great light-weight, non-greasey scrub. I'm 37 years old and I have been using this scrub for 3 years now. I am very pleased.My complication is now flawless and my pores have never looked smaller. This cleanser has a sandy texture that cleans my skin very well.  It leaves my skin so soft and reduces pores to the point that I look equally as good with or without makeup!  Not bad for a woman 60+ years old! Very gentle exfoliating cleanser.  I have seen a difference in my skin, just after using the product for 10 days. GREAT PRODUCT. MAKES MY SKIN FEEL SO SMOOTH AFTER USING IT. LARGE TUB IS AWESOME TOO. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS. Like all Roc products it's great for the skin at a reasonable price.  The slight exfoliating effect gives my skin a glow and wakes me up in the morning - makes me feel alert. This is a great face cream cleanser with microbeads!! I've used this in the past and figured since I hit 30 this month may as well start taking even better care of my skin. I like to wash my face with dove soap and use this afterwards. Love the combination. Leaves skin feeling smooth. I love this entire line by RoC. This is an excellent cleanser which can be used by everyone. I recommend it wholeheartedly! My dermatologist recommended this to address 40+ year old skin and broken capillaries. Have this on subscribe on save. Can't beat the price and convenience. Best face cleaner out there. Gets rid of small blackheads on the nose area and makes big pores look smaller. Great scrub!  Good Products!  I'd say its really *Gritty*, and thats what I wanted! ;) Will order again! I'm a Beaty products junkie. I have tried products like this in high end brands, and believe me, this is so good. Leave your skin feeling super soft and clean. Just keep on mind, this is not a makeup remover, is a face/pores cleaner-exfoliator. Excellent facial scrub and leaves my face feeling well moisturized and exfoliated. Love this product! Cleans and refreshes tired skin. Like a facial in a tube! One of my favor facial cleaner, I usually purchase at my CVS but this site is much cheaper so I'll definite will order more A good scrub This made my face feel soooo clean and soft!  I absolutely love it!  I have  large pores, some which were blocked, and this seemed to clean everything out , giving my face a smoother looking complexion.  I would suggest this to any aging woman, and especially those with large pores or acne.  I'm 44 y/o and I don't recall my face ever feeling so soft.  Love it! Love this stuff, my skin is becoming more even my facial cleanser that I use after this is working so much . Great stuff Honestly, after hours of research for finding another facewash, I stumbled across this one. I never used anything by RoC before so I decided to give it a try. The price was ok and the reviews were awesome. After the first use, my face felt slightly softer, nothing miraculous though. Prior to this facewash, my face developed some dry, rough patches. The texture was uneven, and worst of all, I had terrible acne on my forehead (something that hasn't happened for a long time). I wasn't expecting a facewash to be able to do anything, especially since my $40+ acne kits weren't successful. But after around 2 weeks of use, my acne began to disappear. My skin's texture is soft and the color is more even.This facewash is definitely a savor for me. I replaced this with the Philosophy brand (don't like the company Philosophy anymore, so I won't buy their products) and I never thought I would be able to get the same smooth and clean feel to my skin.  This cleanser is even better - and cheaper! I love this product completely and my bet is that would love it as well. It makes your face smooth and younger in a week. Thank you so much! feels tingly with little scrubbies in the lotion-like cleanser. my skin feels so soft, and there is a noticeable difference! I ordered this cleanser on Amazon along with 3 other RoC products.  I love RoC and what it has been doing to my fine wrinkles and spots on my face and neck!  This cleanser has mini micro beads that gently exfoliate the skin that is sloughing off from the other RoC products that include Retin A.  It leaves my skin soft and glowing.  Will continue to place orders of this and the other Roc products for years to come. I have been using Roc for some time now, and love their products.  This did not disappoint.  I would recommend this product to anyone with mature skin.  Works great with the Clarisonic. My husband and I both use this face wash and we love it. It has a little bit of scrubbing action and doesn't leave our faces feeling too dry. Cleans great. Not too harsh! I just started using this with the RoC Max Resurfacing pads.  The smell is pleasant and the texture of my skin has definitely improved.  This is a great option for those who have acne prone skin, large pores and aging skin.  Also if you don't want to spend $$$$ for high-end skin care. I LOVE ALL  OF ROC PRODUCTS, USE THEM EVERY DAY & NITE.  I AM 73 YEARS OLD, MY SKIN LOOKS LIKE I AM IN MY 50'S. Bought this because my dermatologist recommended it. It has changed my skin! It helps with fine lines and wrinkles and doesn't leave your skin dried out! Will repurchase! I have loved RoC since I was a preteen. This makes me feel like a celebrity but without the high markup prices of other products that I feel do not work nearly as well. Without their anti-aging line I would probably age like dry leather. Thanks y'all! I'm on the younger side and didn't really buy this for the whole ""anti-aging"" bit, but the skin smoothing part interested me. I have some faint acne scarring for years past and thought I'd give this a try. Honestly it surprised me how after a few uses I can really see and feel my scars smoothing out. Most importantly, it doesn't leave my face red and raw! Great product for a guy with sensitive skin.  It is a thick cream with micro beads.  Light, pleasant scent.  Great price This has become one of my favorite face washes, and surprisingly, it's really not that expensive! This one in particular smells great (better than most I've tried - even though people tell me to avoid the ones with fragrances), and it's not too overpowering. It's foaming and it comes with micro-beads that are very small and non-abrasive to the skin. I use this once every other day and it's very refreshing to use. I would definitely be purchasing this again in the future. best face cleaner there is !!1 Exfoliates for a moist, young complexion. I am 80,,,,,,,,, and am told by many that I look 50 !! Sans makeup too! All Roc products deliver.  Roc Rocks.  I will continue to purchase this brand of product Great exfoliating cleanser that is not too harsh or drying. I have fairly dry skin and like this cleanser a lot.  I use it together with the RoC Max Wrinkle Resurfacing System and I am very pleased.  Have only been using about a month, and only at night. I think it may be a little too harsh on my skin to use in the morning too. I see an improvement in the texture of my skin. Have already repurchased another tube and definitely recommend this product if you are looking for a good facial exfoliator. Helps make my skin feel clean and soft.  Great way to start my day.  I've used it for several years. I've tried salt and sugar scrubs that cost more but always come back. This is the first time I have tried this product.  I am very happy with it.  Will buy again. Roc Max Resurfacing Facial Cleanser is the first Roc product I've tried and after just a few uses I will be trying other Roc products!At less than $8.00, this cleanser has a nice amount of grainyness to it, to give a great amount of daily exfoliation.  The grains are smooth enough to not be irritating, but tough enough for some great skin smoothing!  The creamy base to the cleanser is hydrating, but not too much - I think those with oily skin would still be happy with it.  It's also great for removing every trace of makeup.  I like to use this occasionally with my Clarisonic to give an even more exfoliating cleansing.  In the shower, at the skink, morning or night, this quickly became my favorite every day cleanser.  It leavea my skin soft, smooth, and bright.Now I can't wait to try some other Roc products! This has just the right texture to gently exfoliate. I like the smell and it washes off easily. Great price, too! Absolutely love this facial cleanser. The BEST Love it. The only face wash i use now Best face scrub out there. I have tried jyst about all of them and Roc is truly the best. Have been using this for a long time; love how it works, and goes a long way. Love this facial cleanser. Removes makeup and leaves face smooth. Excellent product.  Results are good.  Just gritty enough that I know it is working.  Will definitely buy this again! Like the way my face feel so smooth and clean after using the product.  I really like a lot of the RoC products. Like it and really affordable Gets face clean and makes your face smooth. I like it alot.I use it aleast 5 days a week morning and night. I am using RoC Max Resurfacing Facial Cleaner along with my Olay Pro-X cleansing brush and I absolutely love it. This cleaner has a small amount of exfoliating power behind it, which is nice to smooth out skin and remove makeup or product buildup. Taking my makeup off can be quite a task, especially at night, so a girl needs all the help she can get. The RoC Max Resurfacing Facial Cleanser works great and is absolutely worth the money. For less than $10 in most stores you can get a deep clean that lasts all day or night long without using expensive salon products. I would recommend this cleanser to anyone, I've tried most products out there! This cleanser is very effective for cleaning my facial skin.  It takes a bit of getting used to because it has a sandpaper like feeling at first.  My pores are definitely smaller and my skin is brighter.  I don't know if I can credit this cleanser with all these changes, as I have incorporated other Roc products into my skin care regimen.  Roc is great.  I wish I had begun using it years ago. Glad my face cleaner is available on Amazon! LOVE this!!! I love, love, love this face wash!! I have been using the MAX resurfacing products for reducing fine lines for a couple weeks & decided to add the cleanser.  It has exfoliants and makes my face feel so clean & smooth right before I apply the wrinkle and resurfacing cream.  Love it! This and the rest of the RoC line are my go to facial products from now on. I have never had such clear and gorgeous looking skin and I know it is because of this great face wash and the other lotions and cleansers from this line. I use this in the morning then the facial cleansing pads at night. as expected This pricefor Roc is unbelievable.  Really love Roc Products. I like this product.  Cleans but it's still gentle. is very good good Been using this product for several weeks.  I use it daily when I shower.  I have sensitive skin and it doesn't irritate my skin.  Love the clean, smooth feel afterward. This is wonderful.  I either use this, or ROC's resurfacing discs every day.  Leaves your skin feeling like silk, and totally preps it for receiving retinol or any other treatment you put on it.  I have very sensitive skin, but have been exfoliating quite a bit for years, so this doesn't bother me.  Price is great. This is a great cleanser, I exfoliate every morning & this really does leave my skin softer, smoother & not irritated or dried out. I use this with the Deep Wrinkle Serum, & Eye cream. Definitely something I would recommend to others. just what i need for a good scrub of my face, exfoliate well and leave skin very clean.Overall a good face wash from RoC. I have been using this product for over a year.  I will continue using it as i am happy with the way it exfoliates. it makes your face really smooth and is gentle also..It is not a rough cleaner.. I've only used this twice but decided to try it after using lots of really expensive exfoliators. I exfoliate every day - face, neck and chest and sometimes even my hands, elbows and knees - that's a lot of territory! You get a nice amount for $9.99. This stuff is not as abrasive as the others brands but has some abrasion and does foam up pretty well and rinses off easily.  Skin seems smoother afterwards and my makeup goes on quite nicely.  I don't use the whole line of ROC products but after reading reviews might try them.  I will have to say after two uses the smooth factor is 5 stars."
B00T3V2636," I decided to try this cleanser as part of my exploration into Korean skin care. It is absolutely amazing! It is so creamy and massages into the skin easily. I feel like it does a great job getting all of my makeup off. My skin is clearer and smoother after using it for several weeks. I often use it in combination with my Clarisonic Mia. This cleanser deep cleans, and adds moisture. Not quite sure how that's possible, but here we are! Even after the first use, I saw a huge difference. My skin is clean, moisturised, brighter and smoother. Most impressive, is how a little goes a long way. By little I mean the size of half a pea! I will not be purchasing any other cleanser besides this one! This stuff feels like weird sticky marshmallow on your face. It's so odd but feels good at the same time. Leaves your face feeling very clean but harder to rinse than the regular Snail cleanser. I like it so far and I have very sensitive skin I have been using this with a gentle silicon exfoliator, as well as a vitamin c toner and the tosowoong green tea essence twice a day for my dry, sensitive skin, and it has never looked better. My skin was always breaking out in some places and flaky in others. It was a mess. And most products made it worse. However, this is working so well for me that I was able to wear cheap Halloween makeup and use this cleansing regimen after and not break out at all! Definitely all skin types are not the same, so take this with a grain of salt, but I think it's worth trying. Great product. Came in early, large enough bottle that will last me several months. The bubbles is frothy and thick, it really cuts through my oils and leaves my skin feeling clean without feeling tight.  I'd recommend this product for people with oily or combination skin, the foam in this product could be too drying for people with dry skin. Love this face wash. It feels like I'm rubbing melted marshmallow across my face. It's so smooth and velvety and leaves my skin fresh and clean without drying it. I use this as the second step, the water-based cleanser, in my korean skincare routine. This stuff is seriously magical. I have dry / combo skin and this stuff leaves my face soft and creamy. Looovese. Also smells good too very foamy and cleans well.  a little goes a long way I was hesitant to change products on my sensitive skin, yet my skin loves this wash. My face is clearing, soft and happy with it I really like the Mizon brand, I have a lot of their products. They're one of the few brands that don't break me out. This cleanser is one of my favorites. It's creamy and silky feeling as you apply and leaves the skin feeling soft and fresh cleaning! Will order again! Love Mizon products Officially my favourite MIZON cleanser and cleanser of all time. Feels great on oily, eczema probe skin. I feel clean and not dried out by chemicals. This foaming cleanser is wonderful. Very mild and comfortable on the skin.  Highly recommended. I really like this cleanser. It leaves my face feeling very clean but not tight or dry. Love mizon products,every product I've ever bought has never disappointed me Really a very nice cleanser, my face is so soft and clean. This cleanser is amazing! With only the smallest amount it foams and cleans your face completely, leaving no residue. My combination skin loves this! It feels soft and creamy while washing your face and does not dry your skin out. Definitely the best cleanser I've ever used This cleanser is the perfect compliment to my first cleanse (which is oil).  It takes a very small amount product and a very small amount of water to activate the foam.  And beware because something about foaming cleaners is addictive.  The scent is light and pleasing and it washes off very easily.  This reminds me of the Sheisedo foaming cleaners but it's 1/4 the price!  Also I think that Sheisido is more exfoliating.  Please note that this is not like the typical American cleanser.  This will leave you squeaky clean vs moisturized.  It's best to follow with a toner, essence and then moisturizer.  Without those, you might become dry.  I have somewhat dry sensitive skin and have had no issues with irritation.  Highly recommended.Update:  After using this my skin started to feel a little tight after use.  So, I feel that i no longer need to do a second cleanse.  Will continue to use the Banilla Cleanser only.  As Summer arrives, I might need to add this back in.  Will update if I do! Makes my skin feel fresher and cleaner. I had previously been using a cleanser with tea tree oil in it that had been seriously damaging my skin. It took me a long time to realize I was allergic to it and not purging. With my skin looking red and splotchy, I bought this on a whim based on the good reviews. I didn't have any high hopes for it, but I just needed something that would not make my skin any worse.After my first use, I was floored at how soft and clean my skin felt. It really does feel like a marshmallow on your face, but more importantly, it helped clear up my skin in less than a week. My skin is still recovering, but it is not nearly as red anymore and much, much smoother. I am so thankful I took a chance on this product. My skin type is sensitive and very oily, so if you have the same skin type and are looking for a great cleanser, give this one a try! Absolutely amazing! I use several Mizon products and have never been disappointed with any of them.  The Snail Cushion Foam Cleanser comes in a large size bottle that will last me several months and the texture is creamy and massages into the skin easily. I feel like it does a great job getting all of my makeup off and does not dry out my skin. My snails are so clean and happy wuth the cleanser. They were fed up with the average over the counter cheap ones I got for them before. This is the product to buy if you love your snails. The foam makes their shells shine and gleam. Gary from spongebob loves it too. Maoww."
B01M039QBU," I have moderate cystic acne. I have tried everything with no luck. A dermatologist told me I needed accutane. I waited to write a review because it seems like a product will work for awhile, then quit being effective. I am on my second bottle, and it works! If I faithfully use it, my skin stays clear. If I do get a breakout it definitely makes it go away faster. For the first week, it was mildly iratatting to my skin so I only used it once a day. I use a little rubber scrubby pad for the face wash otherwise it doesn't seem to ""sud"" at all. Also it's so nice to buy it as you need it instead of having a subscription like proactive - please don't change that!!! I usually don't write reviews, because I am lazy. I decided to write one for Neutralyze because this actually works. I've had acne since 4th grade (now in college), and I've tried literally, LITERALLY everything I could do to get rid of my acne. Neutrogena, Proactiv, oral medications, tea tree oil, apple cider vinegar, etc etc YOU NAME IT. None of them really worked for me. Then I found out about this product, and this LITERALLY changed my life. My severe acne is so much better now and people around me notice the big change as well. I was skeptical of the price at first, but it is definitely worth it. My poor twelve year old daughter got her dad's genes and was really struggling with acne. We eat clean, she showers regularly, I didn't understand why it was so persistent. This has been a hard regime for her to follow, but when she is consistent, it is very effective and we are seeing good results. She feels more confident about herself as she sees more results. I feel less helpless as a parent. Background: I have acne prone, combination, sensitive skin. I was at my wits end with my skin and I went to a dermatologist. She put me on spiro which helped clear up my skin and around the same time I started Neutralyze. I exclusively used Neutralyze for several months days morning and night. I've finished my kit and I already reordered another one. I don't know how much my clearing was medicine, neutralyze or both combined, but I can say without a doubt this didn't irritate my skin. That's huge. Cleansers often dry me out and make my skin sensitive and prone to break outs. This didn't cause a single reaction. Now I'm so clear I doin't want to rock the boat so I am continuing with Neutralyze. If nothing else it gets my skin clean without irritation and I highly recommend this system to anyone who fears irritation from acne systems. Worked for my teenager!! Very happy with my order. Ordered for my teen daughter and it’s workimg well and improving imperfections as described! I finally found a treatment for my mid-life acne! Neutralize has made a huge difference! My acne was so bad, I was about to try a prescription for it. Neutralize has stopped my breakouts. I only get an occasional pimple or two, and they resolve quickly with regular use of Neutralyze. I couldn’t be happier with this product! Gave this to my teenage son to help clear up his acne. It seems to be working for him. He skin is Definetly less oily then it has been. And less acne has been popping up lately. He is pleased with the results I noticed a difference. You can't beat the price and the customer service is awesome! WOW !! My wife loves this product. This is a very good product!! Helped tremendously with clearing my skin. Daughter says it works. She has tried multiple products and will stay with this one! it works I have been struggling with terrible cystic acne for the last several months.  My brother recommended this product to me.  Honestly, I'm not sure if my skin is clearing up because of this or because of the oral medication I'm on, but I know this certainly isn't hurting anything.  I'm sure it's a combination of this and the medication.  Also, this is not drying, which is really nice.  I'm definitely happy with this product and plan to order it again. This has worked great for me. Definitely have seen an improvement in my complexion. As long as you follow the directions you will see results too! I bought this for my teenage son because he had problems with blemishes. I was surprised to see a difference after the first time he used it. I haven't noticed any new blemishes and his skin isn't as oily as it previously was. I have actually stolen it from him and now I need to order more. I've tried sooo many skincare products, including Proactiv. Rodan and Fields is a joke with their pricing, but this system is AMAZING. I had cystic acne before and now if I have any sort of flare up, I'll have 1 or 2 tiny zits that disappear within days, where before I'd have about 20 small to large zits on my face even on ""good"" days. this is by far the best product I've ever used for my acne. I am 27 and have had acne since I was about 12. Ive tried AcneFree, Proactiv, Clearasil, Clinique... you name it I've tried it.  Neutralyze has made a huge difference in my acne. I've only had it for about 10 days but my face is so much clearer already. All those tiny little bumps all over my face are nearly gone. My constant 4-5 zits are down to 1 or 2.Bottles are much smaller than expected but I use a dime-size amount of the wash and only one pump (pea size maybe?) of step 2 and 3.  Step 2 stings a little like a toner, but not painful. My face feels so smooth and clean after I use the system.It's awesome. Just buy it. Find a half-off code like I did to make it only $20! Seemed to help my teenage daughter's severe acne. We have tried many different products and this one was the best. Will purchase again. This worked when nothing else did for my 14 year old.  Definitely buying again. After one week of use, this stuff really seems to be helping my ""mature"" skin.  It's easy to use and literally takes a few minutes of my time. Going to buy some for my son in college that is having a heck of a time with his teenage skin. Great kit for acne, my daughter said she had used it before and loved it. So i got her another set and she said the owner is her face savor. Lol So far so good. It seems to be helping with my breakouts. So far so good! The smell of number 2 is pretty strong but it's not a big deal, number 3 doesn't have an odor.. that I've noticed. This is the second package I've bought. I use it for what is probably an off-label skin condition. It's a type of rosacea, and it would run wild if I didn't do something about it. This trio of products truly keep things  down to a very dull roar, In fact, the skin symptoms  and discoloration fade almost completely away, which is great news, and means that I don't have to treat the condition every day. Of course I don't know if this product will help others with a similar condition, but I'd suggest you try it, just to see. You may end up as happy with the results, as I am. Very impressed. I have used for a month now and definitely see a difference. I'm still having a few breakouts, but they are much less severe and heal in days instead of weeks. I've had pretty severe acne and haven't found anything that worked until now. My skin isn't as dry any more either. So happy with this product. I have been using it for 4 days now. There is an obvious difference. My skin is smoother and blemishes are vanishing Ordered this for my 15 year old son so far the results are great...Better than anything else we have tried so far . Neutralyze has change my life! All the sudden when I reach my 30's I develop acne on my face and neck. I got to the point that I did not want to go out in public  no more. I tried different acne treatment  from Walmart and it just got worse all I wanted to do was cry. I was on Facebook and Neutralyze was doing a trial with this product. I figured you why not try it and if it don't work I did not lose that much money.  I can't  thank Neutralyze enough for clearing my skin up. I am amazed on this product after only using it for 5 days, it does miracles. The face wash leaves my skin so smooth, love it. I will continue to used this product long as they make it. THANK YOU NEUTRALYZE !!!!! Started improving my 14 year old daughters skin within a day. I know  that sounds pretty amazing but it's true. I was pleasantly surprised. I use it as well, because even at 44 I still get acne  but it doesn't dry out my skin or make it peel at all and the blemishes i have are fading with no new breakouts.  Very happy with this product. Where as this did not work for me, the company issued my money back within just a few hours of my request. I HIGHLY suggest this buyer as well as trying this product. Rating updated because of truly OUTSTANDING customer service. Definitely worth giving this product a try to see if it works for you.Unfortunately, the product was not effective for me. Its worth a try to see if it might work for you, especially if you're trying to get away from products with benzoyl peroxide. Let me start off by saying first that I have acne prone, oily, extremely sensitive skin. Because I know this, I'm very careful with what I put on because I don't want a bad reaction. This product is amazing. I immediately saw results in the first week of using it. It reduces the irritation of present acne while fading my acne scars. My skin doesn't feel dry at all and my make up goes on so much smoother. I will definitely buy again and I'm recommending it to all my friends. I have used so many products for acne and have even used doctor prescricibed stuff as well. So far nothing has compared to this stuff!! This will probably be my 6 or 7th month using it and it has even removed my acne scars from being a teenager. I'm going on 31 this year and thought I was to old to get acne but after my second boy my face broke out non stop until I started using this stuff. I'm just AMAZED!!! when I decided to try it for the first time I noticed a difference after the first 2 weeks however everyone's skin is different so if you decide to try it at least give it a month or two of a chance...I promise you won't be sorry!!! My daughter seems to like this a lot! Her skin looks great! I love Neutralyze and am so happy I got it!!! I have struggled with adult acne for the past few years.  It was at it's worst when I was in my early twenties, and has only recently gotten somewhat under control.  I tried Proactiv and many other things in that time, but nothing seemed to be working all that well.  From the acne over the years, I was left with some scars, redness, and dark spots.  Although my skin has been cooperating as of recent, those things were all still problems for me.  I didn't know I needed this product until I tried it.  I have only been using it for about 5 days, and already I see and feel the results!  My skin not only FEELS cleaner and fresher, my complexion is brighter and my dark spots have already started to fade.  I have also noticed that my skin doesn't get as oily throughout the day which was another major problem for me.  The 3 steps to the kit are extremely easy to follow and I find myself actually getting excited to wash my face now!  I would recommend this product 100 times over.  Thank you thank you!!!!! Keeping my fingers crossed! My daughter has only used it for two days and I noticed earlier that her face already looked like it was healing.  Normally, she has a few new blemishes popping up daily. There were no new blemishes. Just old ones healing. I pray we finally found the product for her!!! I received this a week ago, on time, and have been using everyday since. It works! I am in my 30's and still struggle with acne and have used everything from proactiv to Rx's with little to no success. Neutralyze has cleared up my skin little by little every day and started working from day 1! Really! I am even significantly less shiny by the end of the day! Wow! The texture of my skin is improved when I use it as well. Great product, I WILL be ordering again! This stuff is worth a shot! I was hesitant to try this because I've been jaded by products like ProActiv. When people rave on and on about something, it seems to not work for me. But I can definately say, this product is different. I'm in my 30's and still suffer from breakouts. I always have at least 1-3 pimples on my face at any given time. This product cleared up my skin in about 4 days. My pimples were smaller and drying out by day 2. With makeup on, my skin looked crystal clear and oil free. I hadn't felt my skin that refreshed in a very long time. I still suffer from pimples due to hormones or allergies, but at least the new pimples are much much smaller, won't get out of control and go away much quicker!!!All in all, I'd say try this for yourself. I'm glad I did! I used to use Proactive but quit buying it because it's so expensive! I've been trying to find a good replacement since I ran out. This is pretty similar and I'm happy with it. It works, but isn't super abrasive. The lotion is light and doesn't feel thick or oily. My daughter has had bad acne since 13 years old and is in constant embarrassment trying to hide her unsightly complexion, so thought I ould give this a try. We tryed almost everthing else on market!!!  Recieved on wednesday, and as of today noticing significant changes in acne (on the PLUS side), skin texture, and tone. Really delivering great results in just a few days. Great Product! Bought this treatment on sale. I have been using it for a solid month and it seems to work very well. I can't say enough about this product! My son has a very small amount but severe to moderate acne around his jawline that had become cystic in nature. We tried managing his diet and countless other products, such as Proactive, Proactive Plus, X-Out, essential oil treatments, Clarisonic brush, etc. I even took him to an aesthetician who told us which products to buy. Everything worked a little bit, if at all, and even if it did  make a slight difference, within a week or two, he was back to the same intensity of irritation and inflammation.  I've lost count of how many hundreds of dollars we have spent in the past two years trying to help get his acne under control. The past month or so has been the worse as his stress levels at school has increased, and there was no treatment that would even make a dent in clearing his skin. He even started developing scarring and pocking from how bad it was getting around the jaw. I came upon this product on a quick search trying to figure out what on earth to do for the poor guy, so I took a leap of faith and ordered it. I read some mixed reviews, but knowing not every product works for every person, I decided it was worth a shot. Within the FIRST USE, the redness and swelling of his acne disappeared. And within the first three uses, all that's left is the spots where the acne had been just a day and a half prior! The rest of his skin looks healthier and smoother than it has since he was a pre-teen! I am in shock at how well it has worked! I hope that it continues, and if so, we will be forever grateful for this product! Nothing we have tried has worked so well so quickly, so we are extremely optimistic :) Great product! Is very effective if you use it consistently! I would recommend this product. This product completely cleared up my acne. I had tried everything and nothing worked until using Neutralize. I struggled with acne and dermatitis since 37. This works! My daughter has very bad acne.  there is very few things that she has tried that helps.  This is one of them.  It is helping her breakouts without drying her skin.  Thanks. Absolutely can no go it bout this stuff!!! Ever since I had my baby I've been breaking out alot and I thought this would help and I was right. It leaves my skin feeling so clean and helps  get rid of my break outs it works I ordered this for my son because we have tried so many products and nothing seems to work. He has been using it for about a month now and we finally starting to see some real progress. His breakouts are less and his face seems less oily as well. I can actually see my handsome boy again! We are going to keep up with the treatments and see if it will go away completely. So far so good. I was waiting to review this product once I could tell whether it was working or not.I have used it for 4 days and I can tell a difference.I am 39 year old female with adult acne. I have tried other products and have not had much success.The difference I have seen with this product is that while it is extremely effecting in treating my acne it is not over drying my skin like other products I've used.Also, I have very sensitive skin and anything with benzine peroxide burns and irritants my face. I was glad that is product didn't have ingredients that burn my sensitive skin.So at 4 days I am seeing my acne clearing up! While the old eruptions are not healed they have dried up and I haven't had any new ones, which is awesome. Didn't dry my skin out. Easy process. No burning or peeling. And the nice rag was handy. My daughter has been bugging me to get her some kind of acne treatment since she has a lot of issue on her forehead. When this arrived she tried it right away. It’s been about a week now and I’ve notice that it has clear up a little. Crossing my fingers that it continues to clear up. Love this product! It works great and does exactly what it says it does! I recommend it to everyone! I even use it on my daughter when she has acne and it clears it up quickly. I found it when I was having bad hormanal acne and it was scaring my face and this product actually helped clear it up and smooth out my skin and take away the scaring. And there is no harshness about it. Definitely worth trying! This product has helped my teenage son with breakouts. He asked that I order more, so I guess he feels it's helping too. It also helped my daughter when she was experiencing skin problems. Acne cleared in two days! This is some amazing stuff! I have terrible, chronic adult acne. Neutralyze hasn't made it go away completely, but I have seen some improvement since using it. It's a little bit hard to get used to only because you're supposed to wait 3-5 minutes between each step, but it feels good on my skin and hasn't caused any redness whatsoever. The set has also lasted me more than one month, so it seems like a good value. I just ordered my second set. I bought this for my son last year and repurchase every time he runs out. He is a teenager that had mild to moderate acne. Before this we tried so many products with salicylic acid that did nothing for his skin. This product has kept his face looking great. He still gets an occasional break out here and there, but overall his skin is clear and smooth. So happy I found this system for him!! This IS A MUST BUY !!!! Only been using for 3 days and my face is almost CLEAR!!!! It is lighting my darker spots from previous acne scars I WILL BE PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT FROM NOW ON!! Thank you for making a product that's affordable AND WORKS! Wow!!! All I can say is WOW!!!! I am 60 years old and have had trouble with acne since I was a teenager. I purchased Neutralyze after reading all the good reviews. I am very pleased with the results. My face looks clearer than it has in years. The product is easy to use, doesn't cause any redness or flaking. I noticed results in just a few days. I would recommend this product to anyone who is struggling with acne. Just give it a try. This has been the best skin care for me. I've tried everything from Neutragena to ProActiv and few other natural or boutique brands. As an adult, I struggled with mostly cystic acne and oily skin. This regimen makes my skin clear and oil free!  Worth the try! started seeing results after 2-3 days, I have bumps on my skin (not necessarily red) but this has definitely gone down after using the products. my skin is sensitive so it did get pretty dry from using these products but as long as i use a moisturizer a few minutes after applying the synegizer, I have no complaints! well worth the price Slow and steady wins the race. Been using this stuff for a week now and slowly seeing an improvement. Extremely thankful it hasn't caused any irritation to my sensitive skin. Can't wait to see a bigger difference after a full month. Growing up I had gorgeous skin! I could use Vaseline  as a moisturizer if I wanted, sleep in a full face of makeup and still not wake up with a pimple in sight! Now as a 33 year old woman my skin has to decided to revert back to puberty and break out like a crazed teenager! I have a few girlfriends who have bought this skin care kit for their teenage daughters and have had great results! I decided to branch out and try it and I’m starting to see a light at the end of this pimpled tunnel! I’m using all three products consistently as directed and I’ve noticed my skin become more and more clear each day! These products are not harsh and super drying like other acne products I’ve tried which is a huge plus! Great product. Seems to be working better than a lot of others that I have tried.  Will buy again for sure. Purchased this for my son and so far it has done a great job clearing up his trouble spots. He has been using it for about 2 weeks and he is pleased with it and it has worked better than any of the other products ( proactiv,acne free, neutrogena) that he has tried. I would recommend it. Like any product, follow the directions,  use it 2 times a day and follow the steps. It does work and does not dry out the skin like some of the others. These products really work and I would suggest it to a friend. I was using a product and it was doing a nice job until it was discontinued. So, in a panic I did some research and found this product set and I really like it and most importantly my face is clear. It is worth the price. Excellent product. Effective and not harsh on skin . I've been using it for a month and my skin is feeling and looking better than ever. My teenage son is starting to get the usual hormonal outbreak of acne.  It drives him nuts, as I remember it did me as well.  Those days are long for me thankfully but I wanted to see if the variety of new treatments available now versus when I was young make a difference.  Despite some marketing promises my research indicated that there are no miracle instant fixes for pimples.  The best-rated acne treatments involved a regiment of products like this one to treat the root causes.  This three-part system is designed to unclog pores, heal breakouts, and soothe redness (hyper-pigmentation).Acne vulgaris is the catch-all term for everything from angry red lesions to tiny white bumps, which are the result of hair follicles and their sebaceous glands becoming blocked and inflamed - vulgar indeed.  Find a good treatment is about finding the right combination of ingredients to troubleshoot each of those issues. Salicylic acid is the key ingredient of a good acne treatment kit.  Just keep in mind, acne treatment is a weeks-long experiment that you’re conducting with your skin. It is slow to heal, and in some cases, it can get worse before it gets better.  This kit rivals other high end name brand products I've looked into that are on the market.  You really can't go wrong here.  Just remember to use it daily. So far I am happy with this. I love that it came with a soft towel for my face. You have to give it time to purge your acne, but now I can go without make up and I'm not embarrassed of my skin. Like any skin care system, you have to be consistent. It's not an instant fix, but better than proactive in my opinion. Absolutely amazing products. My daughters skin looks great since she started using these products. oth of my middle school children are having issues with pimples. This product has noticeably improved their skin. They have been using it for 3 months. I bought this product for my son and he loves it.  He has really bad acne.  We have tried so many products.  Just after a few uses we immediately began to see a lot less white heads.  So far we are very pleased with this product. Package had quick delivery and was well protected. I am in my mid-20's and have never had severe acne, however I tend to have a little acne around my chin and forehead. I am hoping this product will lessen the breakouts and reduce the clear up time.  When opening the package and smelling the products I did not get any chemical smell as posted by another reviewer. I also was pleased to receive the microfiber face cloth which seems of a good quality.  Today is my first day using the product and I enjoyed the feel of the face wash. I made sure my face was completely dry and then put on the clearing serum and then a thin layer of synergyzer. It says to apply morning and night so I will update my review after I have completed the cycle 2 times to see if I start seeing results. I'm in love with this stuff. I have been dealing with acne and acne scars since having my baby 2 years ago.  I've tried everything I could think of,  but nothing helped. My face looked horrible, and I was getting really depressed about it. I would literally get mad and wanted to cry everytime I looked in the mirror. I thought I should maybe try Proactiv,  but after comparing the reviews between Proactiv and Neutralyze I decided to go with Neutralyze and give it a try.  I am so glad I did too,  because I started noticing a difference within a few days! It is clearing up my acne amazingly,  and has shrunk my pores.  It seems to be lightening up my scars as well. It is boosting my confidence already.  I am so thankful to finally find something that is not a gimmick, and that actually works.  I highly recommend this product! LOOOOOOOVVVVVEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!  I am 45 and perhaps my hormones are being fussy.  I do not have 'bad' acne, but my T-Zone doesn't play nice all the time.  They are generally deeper blemishes and I find myself fighting them with products with 10% Benzoyl or really strong salicylic acids designed for severe breakouts. They irritate the skin, cause pealing, burn, and yes, it does seem to clear them on surface, but the deep pocket is very slow to behave itself.  The bad part is, I can only use my age-protecting regime under my eyes and much lighter on my forehead...but not my entire face.  The day I would try to put my moisturizers or retinol products on my T-zone of cheeks, BREAKOUT.I needed a different plan... something milder that I could use on my entire face without the burning.  I have been using this along with a very mild 3% Benzoyl Peroxide-Tea Tree called BPT3.1 for two weeks.  By the second day, a big difference was noticeable.  By day four, no bumps, no imbedded bumps...NOTHING.  I have been using my moisturizers and Retinol products I used on my eyes, for my entire face and I am AMAZED.  Nothing.... not even a hint of anything.  The crazy part is, this stuff isn't expensive.  There is ZERO irritation and I am used to seeing a bump or two once a week for the past years.  My skin looks great and I will buy this wonderful product from this point forward.Those of you with heavy acne.... at least try this.  I am ecstatic! Purchased this for my daughter and it's working great already.  She has tried all the acne products..Proactive, Neutrogena, and prescription meds.  This one seems to be working already. When I decided to try this, I was seriously skeptical, but I gave it a chance. I'm happy I tried it. I saw results within a couple of days as promised. Typically promises like this are exaggerated in my experience, but for this product, that was not the case. Worth the price. Totally cleared up my acne. I look and feel a lot better. I have severe acne.It goes from my upper cheeks to my chin.It is so bad that I don't like to go to some social functions because I am embarrassed. I used Exposed for a month and a half but continued to get bad breakouts at least once a week. Then I heard about Neutralyze which was more than half the cost of Exposed so I decided to give it a try. Within days my face stopped itching and the existing breakout was less inflamed. After a week my face began to clear up, no new breakouts, and little to no dryness. I have tried a bunch of acne lines from the Dermatologist, over the counter and natural. Neutralyze has worked the best without leaving my skin dried out and leaving the skin on my face thin like with Retinol or Accutane. I love this product and will continue to use it. In September of 2016 my face broke out horribly seemingly out of nowhere.  As a 36 year old woman, I thought those days were behind me.  I was accustomed to getting a pimple here or there depending on the time of the month, but nothing like this.  I have included a picture (which was taken on a “good day”) to show how severe and encompassing it was on my face/neck.  After this picture, the acne got significantly worse.  For months I tried everything.  Apple cider vinegar, tea tree oil, lavender oil, black African soap, retinol creams, glycolic face washes, prescription gels... nothing worked.  At my wits end, I decided to take a gamble and try this product.  I was not expecting it to do much, especially not as quickly as it did!  After two days the acne on my forehead dried up and scars were 80% healed.  Five days later the acne on my cheeks and jaw are greatly diminished.  My scars are fading and I am noticing almost no whiteheads and less deep cystic acne.  The deep acne is coming to the surface allowing for extraction.  I know, don't pop or pick, but to leave it is painful.  I imagine that after another week of daily use my skin will be almost healed.The treatments are mildly drying to my skin, but not nearly as bad as some of the other products I have used.  I don't mind the time that is required between steps.  If that is what it takes to heal my skin it's a small price to pay. Both of my teenagers have pretty terrible acne.  We've tried so many different treatments, to include many of the big name, expensive products.  Despite all the promises, no product has ever made much of a difference, and many not only didn't help the acne, but they caused major skin irritation. I had pretty much given up and just lived in the hope that their faces would clear up eventually, when they got older.I did some reading about Neutralyze and decided maybe it was worth trying...just hoping maybe it might actually help. I truly wasn't expecting anything. I actually expected it to do nothing, like everything else we've tried.I cannot believe what happened.  This product cleared up the acne on both my son's and my daughter's faces!!!!  My daughter's scars are even starting to fade.  As far as I'm concerned, this is a miracle product and as long as my teens need it, they will have it!  They do have to keep using it regularly, or the acne returns.  But that won't be for forever.I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is desperate for an acne remedy that actually delivers on it's promise. I am still amazed. I wish I had pictures to post. I have struggled with acne since I was 13 years old. I've tried many things (even proactive) and nothing helped a lot. This has helped so much more than anything else I've ever used. I'm going to definitely tell my friends about this if they ever need this I absolutely love this product.  I have been using it for a week so far and already see a difference in my skin.  I had a few deep pimples when I started the daily routine, and all but one have cleared up.  My skin also looks brighter and is much much smoother to the touch.  This stuff is perfect for me because I have an oily complexion.  It dries out the acne but doesn't over dry my skin (which actually can make skin produce more oil.)  My skin feels soft and moisterized every night now.  I have already seen a difference in a week and look forward to continuing to use this as part of my skin care regimine. It took about 6 weeks for me to see results. But, I didn't flare up, get way worse, or really have any negative effects other than it seemed to take a bit to kick in. But once I saw my skin clearing up, it stayed that way. I never got over drying, itching, burning or painful acne that like seemed to be full on rebelling like I've have with proactive and other products. It was just a slow but gentile and very effective process. While my scarring ans discoloration seem to be persistent, my active acne is gone. I might get a small zit here or there but it's gone shortly after. Make up can cover the scars/redness but it feels great not to have active blemishes all over. I never thought I'd have consistent acne free skin. I've even been going make up free sometimes recently which I haven't done in years. I am in my late 30's and have tried everything and this worked for me. The price is great considering alternatives and it can't hurt to try but give this product some time to kick in gently yet effectively. I am always buying new products for one of my children for acne so since my daughter came across this and said lets try it I figured of course we will get this. It is a three step system which i always remind her that she needs to make sure she is going to take the time to do each one. It has helped already in the time she has been using this and with no reactions such as dryness or redness of the skin. This seems to be one that will really help especially those times when acne is at its worse. She has issues with breakouts on her chest at times and this also helped with those areas as well. I was worried it may be harsh on her skin but it wasn't and it really did what we were hoping it would do and I know she is thrilled with having clearer skin. I really was skeptical about his Acne treatment. I have adult acne and I  have tried so many different kinds and was disappointed. This Neutralyze modersta to Severve Acne treatment works so good. I have been ising it for the past 5 days and hav eseen an improvement on my face. You use step one to clena your face in circular motion. Then you put a layer of step two on and let dry. Finally you put a layer of step 3 and you let it dry. I have been  using it twice a day and have seen improvments. It also comes with a face towel, which is a plus. My son's skin has really started to clear up after he started using the kit. He's typically been resistant to adopting a ""skin care routine"" but the packaging and smells are prettyneutral and the steps simple enough that he hasn't complained. I'm an esthetician and have been recommending Neutralyze for my patients since discovering these product 6 months ago. My cousin has been battling painful cystic acne for years until she started using these products. After using them 2 times per day consistently, she was able to achieve unbelievable results in about 6 weeks, and she is thrilled that she finally found something that works for her skin type (photos attached). I continue to recommend Neutralyze to anybody who comes into our clinic suffering from acne, for both teenage and adult acne. The system really does help to bring down the redness and inflammation immediately, and then you can see a noticeable and gradual improvement over time. I bought this mud mask to help with my sons face. Let's just say he's hit that stage in life where he looks alot like the a tomato. This stuff helps with alot of it and it even makes his skin soft. You know what they say....soft hands are important, well i think a soft face is just as important to the girls. The face mask is made of natural ingredients, that way you'd want it to be made, none of that junk created in labs. This really helped with his acne and blackheads he had. He also said it made his face feel really relaxed. Overall the product was inexpensive and it delivered on its promise! I HAVE to rave. I'm 36 and suffer from adult hormonal acne. I've seen 3 dermatologists. I've been put on prescription pills, washes, topicals, and birth control. I've tried all the OTC store stuff. I've tried only organic. I've tried cutting stuff from my diet although I eat fairly healthy. NOTHING helped. It would dry my face so badly but then I'd get 3 more for every 1 I cleared. I came across this after someone suggested a different brand, but Amazon had similar items. I thought, what's another product going to hurt. I started this 1 week ago. I was skeptical. The step 2 does burn but it has alcohol in it so it's expected. I use it once a day if I'm not too active but twice if I'm busy or have broken a swear. I went from about 15 cystic zits to 5 that are left, and they are mainly red scabs healing. I'm so impressed, I've already ordered my next 30 day supply. I'm hoping it continues to clear up. I haven't seen a clear face in almost 17 years.. this product has given me hope that I will regain my self confidence back and can ditch the 5 lbs of coverup!!!!Ps-I paid for mine, no discounts. I mention that bc sometimes I think opinions are skewed due to being selected for discounted reviews. I love this stuff! In all seriousness, I only bought this because I wanted to try Nerd Skincare (but I couldn't afford it), and Amazon had this recommended as a similar product. When this arrived, I had just that day developed two painful, ugly pimples (one on the edge of my lip and the other in the crease of my nose). I cleaned and treated my face with these three steps, and by the next morning, all of the pain and most of the redness from those two horribly painful and obvious pimples were gone. It truly was like a miracle. Even just using steps 2 and 3 without the facewash works great, too (Not quite as miraculous, but better than any on-the-spot acne treatment I've ever tried)! I was able to convince one of my coworkers to try it as well, and her face has also cleared up significantly--given that we teach high school and constantly deal with judgemental teenagers, this product has been a godsend! This Neutralyze Moderate to Severe Acne Treatment - Maximum Strength Anti Acne Medication, Face Wash (3.3 Ounce), Clearing Serum (1 Ounce)... is a really nice 3 piece kit.  It lasts 30 days and they are all good size bottles. You don't need a lot of this stuff for it to work, and it works well. Very easy to use and it comes packaged really well. It also comes with a bonus free gift, which is a nice microfiber face towel. That is a really nice perk. This kit works well and I do recommend it to those who are acne prone such as myself. I've been struggling with acne and mostly cystic acne for the past 6 years and I'm 29 years old. I would get huge cystic bumps on my cheeks then it just worse and worse. I'm on so many differnt acne/cystic products and after trying this for the first time when it was delivered... I woke up today and saw a huge difference, it helped with my black heads and my acne. I noticed how much it cleared up and swollen down! The serum really helps! I also love how comes with a small face towel. Great purchase and fast delivery! Great set! Even small enough for travel size. The towel came with it which even had washing and usage instructions. Great for the teens or anyone who need a routine but not something too expensive and wasteful. This is the first Amazon review I've ever written in my 3 years of shopping on this website, which should say something about how much I love this product. I'm 20 and my acne in the last few months had been worse than anything during my teenage years, with a lot of very irritated, red but shallow pimples on my left cheek and jawline. I'd tried everything, tea tree oil, benzoyl peroxide, etc (even prescription stuff) but nothing seemed to work. The money back guarantee drew me into this product, so I tried it figuring I had nothing to lose. BEST DECISION EVER! I have NO new pimples right now. None. It's been months since I've been able to say that. All that's left is some scarring, but I find that this product helps greatly with that too. I will say that this product is far from glamorous. The step 2 smells like pure rubbing alcohol; nothing about this is cute or aesthetically appealing. But if you're really serious about getting rid of your acne, give this a try. Everyone's skin is different, so this may not work as well for you as it did for me, but I absolutely can't live without this.One note: I personally wouldn't recommend using a moisturizer with this system. I started off by doing that as some acne kits can be very very drying, but I find that the 2nd and 3d steps combined create a somewhat strange (yet pleasant) gel-like layer on the skin. I've found that putting on moisturizer afterwards kind of disrupts the layer and makes it less effective. I have combo oily skin and this system does not dry me to the point of peeling as other kits have done, so I would try using it without moisturizer first, then add it in if you find you need it. I am only a week and a half in and have seen a major difference in my skin.  Within 3 days my acne started to clear and it still continues to.  I am hopeful that with continued use I will have even less acne.  I do have some dry, flaky skin in certain areas after using the product, particularly when the acne is healing and right after.  But that may be because I am older (almost 40, shhhhh!) so have the fun of both acne and wrinkles and combo skin.  And any dryness is well worth the results and goes away with a tiny bit of sensitive-skin lotion. This stuff works pretty fast! I've been using it for 5 days and my skin is about 85% cleared up. First time in 4 months my skin has looked good. I will definitely be reordering. I love this product it's made my skin look so amazing. My skin feel soft,clean and super clear.😘😘😘🌹🌹🌹thank you seller Great product.  This stuff actually works! I rarely write product reviews, but thought Neutralyze was worth commenting.  I have only had the product for a week now, but am already noticing a  clear difference in my skin. I have tried numerous brand name products in the past to try and resolve my constant breakouts; however, it seemed everything I tried either dried my skin out, or bleached any fabric it came in contact with.  I could not be happier with the results I am currently seeing with Neutralyze and plan on sticking with this product!  So happy I found it on Amazon!  Hopefully at long last my battle with breakouts will be over! Love this product!  I have had a serious issue with my skin breaking out.  At age 55, I started getting cystic pimples that are very painful.  My skin was very inflamed.  I thought it was hormonal so seen specialist and was put on hormones.  But, that still did not help my face.  The breakouts moved under my chin, neck, shoulder and down my arm.  I have tried a lot of products for this issue.  I have even called a dermatologist but can't get an appointment for four months.  I read all the reviews on products and this product stood out.  I figured I had nothing to lose so I ordered it.  It has been just over a month and my face is finally looking clear.  I have one spot on my chin that hasn't totally cleared up.  However, the rest of my face, under chin, neck, shoulder and arms are all healed up and I look fantastic!  My co-worker's noticed the change within 3 weeks and were complimenting me!  FINALLY, a product that works!  I also started taking Turmeric Curcumin as I read it helps inflammation.  I believe these two products worked together in clearing up my skin!  I will continue to use both to keep my skin issues at bay. I started using this acne treatment months ago. I bought it because of the money back guarantee which, at the time of purchase, I believe was a 30 day trial period. I saw some success after thirty days but not what I'd hoped for. I decided to keep on using it because in my search for an effective acne treatment I had had very little success up to that point and no other options to follow. Little by little my skin did start looking better. I really never saw any of my dark spots clearing up though as the months went by; they remained just as dark as ever, but at least I was having fewer outbreaks of new acne.Since then I have gradually added some different elements to my skin care regimen. I use Neutrogena's  microdermabrasion cleansing pads three times a week and Alba Botanica's Sea Lipid Daily Cream on my face. In my last Neutralyze order they also included a microfiber cleansing cloth. I'd never used a microfiber cloth on my skin before, but it works really well, almost as well as the microdermabrasion pads. So I purchased three more microfiber facial cloths (actually they were marketed as baby wipes and secondarily as facial cloths). Now my regimen goes like this: Use the Neutralyze products with a microfiber cloth four days a week, morning and night. Three days a week I use the microdermabrasion in the morning with the Neutralyze minus the cleanser, then at night use all three of the Neutralyze products together. I follow up with the sea lipid cream every day. With these added products, I'm finally seeing my dark spots fade and my face is so smooth and soft to the touch that it surprises me whenever I touch it.Before I felt like I was fighting a losing battle against my acne outbreaks. I'm having more victories than losses now. Before I would try lots of different acne treatments and see minimal success. Now I see so much success that I would not change to another treatment system for fear of the outbreaks getting out of control again. I will continue to use Neutralyze because of that success. I LOVE this stuff.  Seriously, I've used Salicilic acid meds often and none have worked like this kit does.  Yes one of them has SA in it, but the combination of that with the face wash is AMAZING.  Truly in just 4 days  I have seen results.  I have been fighting this one spot for MONTHS.  Yes Months!  and in four days it is almost gone!  I am sold and so very happy to have found this.  And no I am not receiving anything to provide this review. It is from the heart!  Also, I am over 50.  I thought I was too old for this and given my teen years were almost void of acne, I assumed I had dodged this problem.  Luckily this product works very well. I was very pleased with this treatment. It's affordable and has a great feel to my skin after each use. I have oily and dry skin. This acne treatment helped me balance all of that mess and kept my acne to a minimum. I can hardly notice it anymore! My confidence is back and so is my great looking face. :)**Follow up**A month later and I'm still using this product. I got my teenage daughter on board when she saw my results and it's worked really well for her, too! The best out there!  My second time purchasing it. Purchased this for my 13 year old son. Was super skeptical because he has cystic acne really bad! We have tried sooo many products, even antibiotics from the dermatologist and none of it helped. He has been using the 3 step program for 5 days now and we have already started to see clearing! I will definitely be buying this over and over again! I am 60 years old and still fighting acne. But this product has given me hope. I have been using it for about ten days and my skin looks and feels so much better. I will definitely buy this product againUpdate: I have now been using Neutralyze Acne Treatment for a while now. I love it even more! It has evened out my skin tone and my skin feels great. I still have an occasional breakout which seems to be due to some things I eat. But this product really seems to shorten the break out time.  Give it a try! Purchased this cleaning system for my husband. Unfortunately, he has had a bought of onset adult acne. We were using mask and cleansers for him, but he needed something a little stronger. His occupation requires him to be in the public eye (he's a boss) so he is really subconscious. The directions are easy to follow. Wait a few mins in between steps to allow to dry and absorb. We have seen an awesome improvement and it is worth the multi-steps. I have used a ""big named"" brand in the past that caused irritation. This has proven much more effective. I'm a 21 year old female who has dealt with chronic adult acne, and nothing has touched it. I eat clean, don't eat dairy, drink tons of water, and exercise. Before now, nothing has helped long term.What I love about this system is that it's so easy. It's one cleanser and two topical medications. Takes all of 5 minutes! After my first application I noticed a drastic reduction of redness and irritation of my blemishes. Today is day 3 of using this twice a day, and my skin is SO much improved. I've began leaving the house without foundation and concealer, which was never an option until now. I'm loving this system so far! Will update with changes! My daughter is going through her typical teen phase where she is breaking out a lot and has a lot of blackheads ,we purchased this in hopes it would help her control these breakouts .This is a 3 step process and if i may say so myself we are beyond impressed .The first night she used this she had a big pimple on her face and by in the morning it was gone ,not only did this work for her acne but also for her redness on her cheeks .After a couple of days of use she came home and made a comment saying that she was beyond excited that this is helping her skin .Now she has self confidence again .She had no dry skin after use which is what i was worried since she has very sensitive skin . This product is working.  My skin started to improve immediately and continues to get more clear each day.  It's almost time to reorder, and I will order it again! So far used 4 days and already clearing up daughters acne. This is working! I can't count the number of acne systems I have tried in the last 2 years and dollars spent. I am suffering from what I think is hormonal  cystic acne and even the most expensive products could not help my skin! I saw  neutralyze in amazing young chance and thought I'd give it a try. I'm so glad I did! The formula is so gentle but it's working! I love the two gels. I can feel them working as in it them on! The swelling goes down right away with step 2, and my skin is softened and moisturized and the redness is lessened very quickly! This is a big deal! I don't have to wait days for the pain to go away, and I don't have to take forever applying my make up to hide the spots anymore! I was having breakouts all over my face before I used this, now my face is clear! My jaw line still breaks out, but that is another issue I need to talk to my doctor about. But this helps heal and lesson the breakouts better than anything I've used so far! I just made a second order.I'm super pleased with the company that distributes this because there's was a coupon code right on amazon to use for my purchase! Awesome! AND to top that off, after receiving my order I just got an email with another coupon code for my next purchase!! What?! Super great customer service. I will be buying this again and recommending it to friends! Thank you Neutralyze!!! Where have you been?! :) I'm soon to be 30 and never had acne until now, probably due to hormonal changes. Over the last year, my face has become scarred with purple dark spots, small whiteheads and these cyst like bumps that never really came to a head and were so painful... I was distraught. Got online and started looking at reviews and this one stood out and I will say this:DAY TWO AND CYSTS AND BUMPS ARE NEARLY GONE.No redness.No swelling.You can barely tell where I have the scars from previously popping or scratching the acne months ago.IN JUST TWO DAYS.As my break outs tend to get worse around my monthly cycle, I may not have to use this daily. its a waiting game to see if it prevents the breakouts, but by god, it durn sure took it away for me. Skin isn't overly dry either.Worth the try to see if it works for you.I'm happy as all-get-out. This product was recommended to me by a friend. I have to say I am very surprised and pleased with the results. I've only been using it for 3 weeks but I've noticed a  difference in my skin. I especially love the clearing serum. It's a miracle worker for those surprise blemishes and controls the area where I typically get breakouts from sweating at the gym. Overall, I am really happy with this product. I have a skin picking disorder caused by anxiety and OCD. I've had it since I was in high school and I'm 21 now. It makes it extremely hard to get rid of acne and have clear skin. I use so many products on a strict regime I've kinda developed over the years that has kinda tamed my skin. Dermatillomania causes me to pick at my face basically whenever there's something there to pick at. Its a vicious cycle, the picking causes more acne and then more picking. Usually I will have an ""episode"" and I'll have picked at my skin for a good 30-45 minutes or longer (unknowingly). Then I'll feel bad, take real good care of my skin with the regimine I mentioned and then eventually the cycle will begin again...BUT.. THIS PRODUCT.. OMG. I am so thankful for this stuff. This product worked SO FAST that it got rid of anything to pick at before I had the urge to pick at it.! And the cycle became positive.I use Neutralyze twice a day (along with my usual regimine, its an OCD thing, my skin does get dry but I just moisturize a lot), my skin gets clearer over night practically, I look in the mirror and don't see anything I can pick at, face gets clearer, repeat.I do still have dermatillomania and sometimes during times of stress or sadness or whatever, I'll find things to pick at on my face. I'll create things to pick at and I'll have an episode. BUT this Neutralyze stuff saves my face over night and helps me forgive myself and be nicer to my skin. I've stopped picking at my face so much. The change feels dramatic. I am so happy I found this. I used it for the acne's at the corner of my forehead. (I get acne's after an intense workout and/or due to high level of stress.) I have tried it for 5 straight days and I can say that it works without peeling your skin, like some of the other products do.In my case, I have followed the instructions religiously and the acne's on my forehead region started disappering after the 4th day.  I did feel difference from the first day to the 4th day I used.  (At each case my acne would hurt when pressed on it at the beginning.  By the 3rd and 4th day, things tend to ease up.)  On the 5th day, I can say it is gone (however, there is still residual I could feel).In addition to my forehead, I used it for the razor bumps on my neck area. It did work much faster in that area than my forehead.For towels, I used the cotton baby washcloths we already had it at home.  Didn't need to use the one that came with the product. I bought this for my teenage daughter and we have seen great improvement with her acne. I've actually began noticing a difference already. I was a bit skeptical at first seeing that salycilic acid was one of the ingredients (and seems to be in every single acne product out there) but somehow this product must be different, because acne that normally takes weeks to go away is only taking a few short days. I haven't been using this product long, so I'm hoping once my existing acne clears up, the product will also prevent future breakouts as well. I've been buying Neutralyze for my girlfriend for over a year now, and her face has stayed completely clear throughout the entire time. She said you can really feel the products working as they give a really deep clean feeling. She used to have pretty bad acne as well as scarring and post acne marks. Her 2 sisters liked the results they were seeing and have been using Neutralyze since and their entire family swears by this product line. If anyone is looking for an acne product that actually works, I strongly recommend giving this stuff a try! They also have great customer service and are always accommodating whenever I contact the company. This is an amazing product and I have tried many that cost me three times more each month. I am 46 year old female and struggle with adult acne and cysts and this product has zapped any possible breakouts and is even helping eliminate my troubling cyst. It works so quickly and if I feel a pimple starting, it never truly appears and is gone in a day. My 14 year old daughter is also using it (not as religiously as I do) and her skin looks great. Great product for me and my teen and I am very happy!! Neutralyze is seriously magic in a bottle. I was SHOCKED to see the results I'm getting over the past few weeks. I've been dealing with pretty severe acne for a few year now. I've been going to the dermatologist but nothing has worked. Not only has Neutralyze caused my acne to disappear, my skin texture is noticeably improved, brighter and more even toned. I will NEVER go without these products, not even for one day. Can't say enough about these products and the company. Truly life-changing. See my Before & After pictures attached. In two days I can already see and feel a difference. I was using Differin and it made me breakout more and it severely irritated my skin. The redness is gone and the pimples I have are already smaller. I can't recommend this enough! I have a happy face for the first time in a long time Neutralyze is hands down way more effective than Proactive or Murad. We've tried so many different acne medications and nothing has worked until we tried Neutralyze. Besides not working, Proactive was way more expensive because they sold me 10 different products for pimples, blackheads, complexion, scars, pores, moisturizer, and all of the ""free gifts"" that somehow cost me hundreds of dollars. We like Neutralyze way better because not only does it work really well, but for $40 we can just buy their kit and it takes care of everything. Only started using this product for a few days but already seeing great results. The wash really makes your skin feel clean. Yes, very pleased and excited!  It's been about 2 weeks and my son is getting very positive results. Recieved mine yesterday delivery was very fast.......used all 3 of them and i must say this product is amazing 5 times better than proactive which never works by the way lol!!!!! The face wash felt refreshing and doesnt dry your skin so as the other 2 treatments.........will buy more!!! I am in my mid 50s and due to medication have experienced severe adult breakouts. I have tried just about every brand name product available until this one. To my astonishment, it really did live up to its claim of beginning to work within 3 days. I have used it for a few weeks and my skin has cleared and looks much better. Although I need to take the medication once a week I have found that this product has helped keep the breakouts under good control on between doses. Amazing product - much better than another major and similar (yet more expensive) product - customer service is stellar, no complaints. I did see improvement in the condition of my skin within 5 days, as advertised. Will be buying again. This is a great skin care line. I purchased this product for my teenager who has systic acne. After, using it for the first week there had been a noticeable improvement of her skin(not so RED and irritated). The only thing I would like is for the bottles to be bigger as they are 1 ounce. I will definitely buy more and I would recommend this product. I love these products.  I have not only noticed a change for the good where my acne is concerned (really? acne at 59 years of age?  Yikes!) but have also seen improvement in the texture and sun damage I have been fighting for YEARS!  Thank you!! my 16 year old son and I use this and it has changed both our skin.  We both won't live without it. He has teenage acne and it immediately took out the redness and got rid of the majority of his problem on his face and back.  I use it for my fine lines and dark spots from taking hormones.  My skin looks like porcelain now.  Also it is not drying.  My son refuses to use benzoine peroxide because it dries his face yet other blemishes still come through.  The towel that comes with this product is so luxurious and soft, it feels like your in a spa.  Also it's free!  Can't beat that.  Try it, you'll LOVE it.  We do. I honestly cannot speak highly enough about Neutralyze. Coming from someone who has suffered from skin problems for the greater part of my life, I have tried everything with little to no result until I was able to try this product. Don't expect results over night, but, within just 3 days my skin was softer, clearer and overrall, it genuinely felt better. To me, this is like a miracle in a bottle. You can even look at my progress photos to see the difference it made in my skin.The process is easy and the products are not harsh on my sensitive skin. They smell great and leave no residue behind. Simple! If you've tried everything and nothing seems to work, give this a try. You won't be disappointed! I'm in my 40s but occasionally experience very bad breakouts still (thanks PCOS!) I used to use pro-active but did not like that it bleached out my bedding and clothing. It was also a bit too harsh and dried out my skin. I am so happy I found Neutralyze Acne Treatment. It is really easy to apply, you simply wash your face with the wash, apply the Clearing Serum and then the Neutralyze Synergizer and go! It does NOT bleach out my sheets or clothing and seems to be working really well. I was concerned with how small the bottles are but 1 or 2 pumps nicely covers my whole face/problem areas so I expect this to last. My skin has not dried out from use either. After applying, my skin feels normal not like there is anything heavy, sticky or drying on it. This product is excellent!! My 14 year daughter uses it twice a day and her face is so clear. We will stick to this product.😁 So far so good. My daughter has severe acne, getting no relief from anything, even prescriptions. But after using this it has been a HUGE difference. Skin is smoother and acne has decreased significantly. I wish the bottles were bigger or cheaper as I'd like to be able to buy continuously. This wasn't purchased for myself, but my granddaughter, who is dealing with this problem. I asked her if she liked what these products are doing for her so far, and her response was positive. NEUTRALYZE ACNE SYSTEM has been a face-saver!  I have suffered from acne my entire life.  Regular white heads and blackheads but also deep painful cystic acne.  As a 34 year old, I had looked forward to these older years because my acne was supposed to disappear.  No. Not me. Adult acne! Until I came in contact with NEUTRALYZE.  I have tried other acne systems claiming all the best results, they either worked for a while and quit working OR completely didn’t work.  Neutralyze has cleared all my acne including cystic, blackheads and whiteheads!  I am so grateful to Neutralyze for their commitment to skin.  It’s non drying formula keeps my skin from peeling and keep it looking great!  I got this product for free but my review is honest and true.  I would recommend this to everyone with acne! Ive been using this system for about a month now and couldn't be happier! My skin has never been clearer! This stuff changed my life. I've had horrible acne and scars my whole life. When I first started using the product, I believe that it was bringing all the acne and bad stuff under my skin to the surface. So yes I broke out at first, but within a few days my face was getting clearer and clearer and hasn't stopped getting better. I haven't had a new pimple since and my stubborn acne scars are fading away. OMG! This stuff works. I have bought every type of acne cleaners there is on the market. Nothing seemed to help my granddaughter. I thought we were going to have to take her to a dermatologist. Then I stumbled on this product and it has made a world of difference. My granddaughters face is clearing up. She has been using it for about 3 weeks and the transformation is obvious. She will wash her face in the morning using the products and the special wash cloth provided and again before she goes to bed. We saw and improvement in the first week. If you or someone you know and love has a severe acne problem please get this product for them you will not believe how great it works. I absolutely love this acne treatment! It made such a difference in my skin, and I love it. My cheeks and chin are my trouble areas on my face, and once I started using the product, it started to clear up and I am getting great results. This product is convenient in size, so if you are traveling, it is easy to take it with you. It comes with 3 bottles and has step 1, step 2 and step 3 written on them. The pamphlet tells you what everything is for and it explains what each bottle does and how to use it. I will recommend this product to my friends and family. My 14-year-old's oily T-zone blackheads and white heads are greatly diminished after using Neutralyze for 10 days. Back acne is improving, too. Get this for your daughter/son if they're suffering with breakouts. Good stuff! My daughter-in-law confiscated the Neutralize Anti-Acne Solution. She was impressed that the face wash not only cleansed her face nicely but removed her professional makeup too! The clearing serum felt refreshing and the anti-acne solution felt a bit sticky but ultimately left her face feeling smooth. I wish this product had been around when I was younger! This product is amazing! I actually bought it by mistake I thought it was a different version of proactive ( I've been using proactive before and my bottle was gone) when it arrived I realized it was another brand so I tried anyway and wow it's been only 4 days and this is sooo much better than proactive at least for me this neutralyze really worked, two days later and I don't have any acne no blackheads and even the dark spots are fading so hope this works for everyone as it did worked for me!Highly recommend! I decided to buy this for my 14.5 year old daughter who suffers from acne on her face and back.  She has tried so many different products and also prescriptions for her acne.  Some work for a while and then stop working.  I ordered this product because is was more economical since she goes thought is fast using it on her back and face.  She noticed great results in only 3-4 days!!  She is so happy and in turn it makes me happy.  Love to know this is a family owned business I am also supporting.  I do wish they had a moisturizer for acne prone skin.  We have to purchase a moisturizer  elsewhere.  She is on month 3 and I just ordered 4 more months.  I hope it continues to work for her!! Very effective, just like the other reviewers state.  It does have a harsh smell and a very drying effect; but appears to be doing the job.  I'm in my fifties and just now getting theses obnoxious break outs.  Nothing I was using was working effectively.  I've only used for a week but see a huge difference.  Once the initial breakout is cleared up I think I'll only switch to once a day since it is a bit harsh. Excellent product for my teenager!  Cleared her face up and keeps it clear. This product is amazing. My son has been dealing with severe breakouts for the last three years even seeing two dermatologists. We have spent a fortune on products, after using this 3 step program ""bam"" all clear!!! In only one week!!! So happy to see my sons beautiful skin and not to mention his beautiful smile that goes with it!!!!!He works out and tends to break out on his chest so plan on trying anything Kanyian makes in a body wash as well!!  Happy Mom and Happy Son Works great without drying out my skin. I have a Teen and a tween so acne is no stranger in this household. This is a great kit. It's a 3 step system. First step is the face wash. The second step is the cleaning serum and the last step is the synergyzer. The face wash is a little over three ounces and the other two are about 1 ounce. So far this kit has been just what we needed. Works great and fairly affordable for everything you get. I am very pleased with my results. I have been using it constantly since November 2016 and have not absolutely had any blemishe's since the end of December 2016. Must be  patient for results. It will work. I've used proactive in the past for years and would have breakouts. This is nothing like those brands. Best affordable anti acne system especially if you're in your 40's. amazing! very happy w results...my zits dried up and completely disappeared in less than a week. I still have acne as an adult and it's really hard to find something over the counter that works. I have been using this product twice a day for 5 days and I'm already seeing results. I haven't had any kind of skin irritation or dryness. I would highly recommend giving it a try. Really do like this product... On top of having to battle acne, I also have medical conditions that add to my problem skin... Having sensitive, oily and dry patches, this product does the trick... it is true what the reviews say -- u can see a difference in three days...  If Step 2 ""The Clearing Serum"" starts to over dry, just use it at night followed by ur Step 3 ""Synergyzer.""  Absolutely love the face wash... I hardly ever take the time to write reviews, but I am exceedingly happy with this skin clearing system!I've only been using it for four days, but from the first day I could feel and see the effects. I use it once in the morning, and once at night.  Already, the acne and severe swelling that I had been enduring for months had gone away.  I have used witch hazel, Proactiv, charcoal, tea tree oil -- and nothing was truly helping.I'm prone to oily skin, which leads to the acne breakouts in my T-zone.  My pesky oily shine has gone away and with it, the breakouts that soon followed.Highly recommend.  Again, my skin type is oily Tzone (as well as breakouts in jawline).  I didn't have a lot of pimples, but I'd get stuck with the big painful red ones. Been using a week and not seeing improvement. Will keep using for a while and change review if it gets better.UPDATE: Have seen some improvement in my daughter's skin. I think it just takes timeTo work. The company is very accommodating and helpful. Wonderful customer service. This is IT! If your reading reviews trying to decide, just go ahead and order. I have had severe cystic acne my whole life, and suddenly I had a resurgence of it in my mind 30s. It was humiliating, having to use concealer and multiple creams to cover it up for work daily. I hated looking in the mirror. I started using this product and within a couple days it all started to clear up. I'm talking 20 pimples immediately dried up. A week later and my skin is clear. CLEAR. I've NEVER been able to say that before. This product was worth every penny! Excellent product! I’ve noticed results within days. :) I love the dewy feel it gives my skin. I've never had an acne problem. I dont even remember ever getting a blackhead in my life. Not even as a teen i had more than one tiny pimple on my face at a time. But I changed countries and with this new climate i started to have what i call ""underground"" pimples on one of my cheeks. I panicked because ive NEVER had anything of the sort so inmediately i started trying for solutions. Nothing worked. After 7 months I found this and omg, it totally worked. Like, by the third day my cheek was fully normal! I am very happy with this product. I dont really know if it works for like, severe conditions (honestly my thing was barely even visible) but it worked for my underground pimple cheek. Now I am more grateful for never really having acne; its very annoying. But even if something else pops up, this thing has my back My daughter in law told me that she has already seen a difference! I have never really had an issue with acne as an teen but since I hit my 30 and up I have noticed that I have been breaking out quite a bit. I'm happy that I found this kit, it has helped get my break outs under control and even though there is 3 steps they are so easy to do you don't mind doing them every day. I haven't had any issues with my skin drying out or anything since using this product. I would def recommend this to others. I was skeptical at first because my skin is so sensitive. Like any new product, my face broke out the first couple days I started using it. After I was using for a couple day my skin cleared up and is now better than ever! My skin also appears to be a lot smoother now. Sometimes acne treatment burns with it is put on or leaves behind an oil but I haven't had any of these issues so far. The seller followed through to make sure I got my 25% discount on the second purchase. The first one has been working great. After a week of use, I am beginning to see a marked reduction in the scaring and zits have all but disappeared In high school I was using My Skin ID and after it was discontinued every face wash that I tried didn't help me. This is the first one out of numerous others that has showed improvements after a few days.  After a week the huge bumps that were on my cheek are nearly gone and my complexion looks a thousand percent better. I totally recommend this to everyone struggling with acne. Very good product my son is using it and is very happy with the results thanks!! I bought this for my cousin in Korea as she was suffering from Acne and the only option left was Accutane.  After reading the reviews, I thought heck let's give it a shot.  To my surprise it's working!  Her skin is less inflamed and acne is going away.  I'm so glad because acne was the main source of her insecurity.  I'm going to order a few more in the future for her :) Very classy hat I got this product for both my partner and I to use because he has oily skin and gets really bad acne and I get stress related acne. His skin is super sensitive and has allergies to most acne treatment products but can use this one without any issues! I love the 3 step process myself. It's been a little over a month and it's definitely made a difference! We tried everything for teenaged - hormone induced acne... Proactiv, prescription strength treatments from the dermatologist, dermatological...And were desperate enough to go down the acutane route. I tried neutralyze because it sounded mild and easy to use for my teenage daughter. The difference was night and day and was apparent within about four days of trying. I can't say enough about it! Great product! Easy to use, instructions are easy to follow. Applied easily on my face, with no problems. Doesn't dry me out or cause any other issues. Within days, my skin is cleared! The product is excellent, it is helping me to improve and control my acne outbreak. I have 2 days using it and its result is incredible.I recommend 100% I love this system! Has worked really well for my skin. I would recommend this! Love this stuff. Bought it for my teenage daughter. I bought myself a thirty day supply a week later. It works so great and even makes pores appear smaller. Super happy with my purchase. Worked very well on my 13 yo son's acne. My son has extremely sensitive, combination skin. Took about a week, but a major impovement was seen! Love this product. This has worked wonders for my preteen that is having issues with acne already. It's not harsh on the skin and doesn't  cause dryness like most acne products. It's directions are easy to understand so she's able to use it without supervision. So far so Great! This stuff worked on my sons face when nothing else would!  Starting noticing a difference after 4 days! Amazing!! I'll be buying this for him moving forward I purchased Neutralyze skincare for my 15 year old daughter who has been battling periods of severe acne this year. After a few weeks she is doing so much better, the redness on her face has diminished and when she has a breakout  she applies the products at night, by the morning it is already healing. After 4 to 5 visits to the dermatologist and using Proactive had not been giving her positive results, I'm so glad I happen to read about Neutralyze online. Very happy with our purchase! Here's what you wrote:I have been using this product per product instructions since I received it and have been amazed by the results. My skin feels healthier and looks amazing. I have specific times I seem to breakout so am curious to see how it handles those trouble times, but so far has been amazing."
B00377YNEC," The best Really like this cleanser so far!  Makes my skin feel moisturizers and soft. Great product. keeps skin clean and clear Great smelling, face feels fresh this stuff makes my pores smaller and face squeaky clean. Great product, love how my skin feels after using it. Clean and refreshed makes my skin feel very soft and clean! Im in love with weleda product 😍 Great 👍 Great I thought it was a bit odd at first since there was no lather, but after rinsing this off my skin was clean and so soft!  I can't wait to see long term results.  I will be buying this again.Update: Upon using this for a few weeks, it began to break out my face.  Although, I still love how well it cleans and how soft it mys my skin, I have to use it less frequently so that it doesn't add too much moisture and I have an acne breakout. I wash my face with hot water using a wash cloth only in the shower in the morning, at night I take a few drops of this cleanser on a cotton towel and wipe my face clean, no rinsing, just the cleanser, and it not only freshens but the lanolin softens. I have done only these two things to my face for 25 years and at the age of 52 I have problem free skin. It does what it advertises, you wipe it on and it cleans off the days grease, it tones, but also it is not too drying. It is high quality and one bottle lasts me two months. I got this for my 40+ skin and it's just radiant now.  All my blemishes (adult acne) disappeared and I haven't had a single one in at least 6 months.  Then, my 14 year old son tried it and it cleared up HIS acne.  Can't believe that it works on both skin types. Amazing!Plus, I feel good about the ingredients, it's impact on our skin and the environment.  I'll use this forever. I've using this cleanser for almost 25 years, I love it! It's very good at keeping your skin clear and completely natural, just the best! Love this cleanser, it really cleans your pores with a fresh scent and added bonus of a toner all in one. Only complaint is to small of bottle because I use daily I am ordering every month :(. I have to endorse this cleanser/toner. It is wonderful. It cleans skin beautifully but does not dry it out and has cleared up my skin like nothing else. Your skin will feel fresh and not over-cleansed. I will buy other Weleda products because I am so pleased with this. This is the best quality brand of all that I recommend to anyone. I have been using this product for a while, but I finally found the best deal here in Amazon. I will keep buying this product here. This stuff is great. My acne came back after accutane and all other products seemed to strip my sensitive skin leave it blotchy and irritated. After rinsing my skin with this, it feels and looks better and brighter immediately and I am not breaking out as often. I will recommend this to anyone. The first time I tried wiping my ""almost clean"" face with a cotton ball with this cleanser, I could not believe the amount of impurities that came off on the cotton. Almost as much as the first time I ever tried a Biore pore cleanser strip on my nose. Kind of shocking that skin we think is nearly clean, is not. I would never put soap on my face, but I do recommend the Weleda for nightly cleansing and the Simple Radiance wipes for dead tired fall into bed nights and a hot weather pick me up.  Be sure to rinse it off and then I use Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair and a good moisturizer. i have normal to dry skin and so far this is working great on my skin! smells amazing too! but then again i love all weleda smells!! This product is amazing, highly recommend."
B01MYA4Q1X," Makes you skin soft and smooth. Love this product Works great, will buy again great product I used a few times and every time someone asks me if I had a facial! Great item. Great seller. love this product! My skin was super smooth after one use. Bought as a gift and my daughter loves it... great product Bought this for my son because his back and arms have started to break out. To my surprise, his arms are clearing up and his back is slowly clearing up. His problem was acne, a lot of the red bumps and some white head and blackheads, but mainly red bumps. The only downfall was when I got this, some sort of oil had leaked out on the tub but nothing else was wrong with it. He has used it on his face a little but we're mainly concerned with his arms and back. His chest started to break out so he put it on his chest and they went away pretty fast. This scrub has helped clear my face. Using it 2-3 times a week in the shower on my face and Chest leaves it feeling FRESH. it’s a mixture of sea salt and charcoal so it’s a nice balance.Or DOES leave your skin feeling a little oily? If that’s the right word to use. After use the oil stays on your skin (to moisturize) and i personally use another face wash to wash it off. But my hubs loves the feeling and he doesn’t put lotion on afterwards. He’s all for skipping steps This scrub is the best scrub I have ever used. It feels scratchy at first but leaves my skin very soft and silky. If you have cuts or scrapes on your hands or face, it will burn. Especially after shaving. This product also works very well on the chest and back. I cannot say that it fights acne as its sole purpose but it doesn't make worse, which is good. I am someone who has very sensitive skin and for me to be able to say I can use a product like this with Oils is remarkable. I love charcoal products and always trying new ones.  I'm often in the sun with my daughter playing select softball leaving my skin super dry all the time.  I started by using on my arms but after using for a few days I noticed how well it was working that I started using it all over!  You don't need a whole lot and if you use too much it will leave your skin tinted but easily washed off.  This jar will last me a while and worth every penny.  I'm looking forward to continuing to see improvement in my skin and complexion! I have never used anything especial on my face or body at 46 I was kind of scared to. I took a chance and used this and I was really surprised. My skin felt rejuvenated and refreshed afterwards. My skin felt clean and my pores felt alive and didn't dry out my skin. I love the fact that it was all natural and there were no chemicals that could seep into my body. I will definitely buy this again once the tub I have runs out. Great on my feet and elbows with my dry skin. I have sensitive skin and am always on the lookout for scrubs that aren't too harsh but get the job done. This does exactly that. I love activated charcoal products because they leave my skin glowing and blemish free. This product didn't irritate my skin (have only used for body, not for my face) and left it soft, smooth, and moisturized. Will definitely purchase again. Great scrub skin is smooth sof and so clean after using. Will definitely buy again! Xoxoxoxoxo This is a nice scrub. It is a chunkier, oily concoction that seems to work well. It is not overly abrasive. It leaves a bit of an oily residue after you rinse it off, which I'm sure would keep you quite moisturized if you just rinse off the scrub. I don't like oiliness on my skin, so I rinsed off with some soap. That being said, my skin wasn't as dry as it normally is this time of year. I love using this on my face before going out for the day. It feels so refreshing and clean and a great exfoliate, it's not too rough but not too soft. Only downside is you have to wash it off fairly well to not have any black residue on your face. The activations with the exp---- effect is super effective in handling my problem areas. I use it before face mask or before I use my normal face wash too; it acts like a helper in a means it's gets rid of dead skin and helps open your pores. I seriously couldn't wait to try this product and already have it set up in my shower for everyday use. I absolutely love how soft it made my skin feel! I have a lot of issues with my elbows being extremely dry and dark and I know with due time this product will solve that! After I scrubbed problem areas I started on my face where I have a lot of blackheads on my nose and chin area. The scrub wasn't too harsh for my face like some scrubs can be and my face felt so smooth. I seriously used this product all over from my face, back of ears, neck, elbows you name it! Not only did it make my skin feel super soft but it smelled great too. I will be purchasing more and telling friends and family. I might even let them try a little of mine. This charcoal scrub is amazing! Majestic pure has the best products. This scrub left my face feeling very soft and clean. You can actually use this all over your body, not just your face. It doesn't really have a smell which is great. I love how much product I get for the price. I absolutely recommend this activated charcoal body scrub! It is great! What a great product! I've found that usually with certain scrubs I tend to have a break out afterwards due to the oils from that specific product, but to my surprise, my skin was great!! It helped with so many aspects of my skin including the flakey dry spots on my elbows and didn't leave any oils behind! This is such a great product and I truly recommend them to everyone!!! This Majestic Pure charcoal scrub is a great product.  It is made of natural ingredients which is a plus for me.  I use this on my face and my body.  It deep cleans your skin making it feel soft and smooth.  It is not harsh on your skin.  Removes dead skin and detoxifies.  Will be buying more of this in the near future! THIS IS AWESOME! I came across this on amazon the other day and just had to try it, and am so glad I did! It leaves your skin feeling so smooth and soft and just clean feeling. It gives you that refreshing ""ahhhhh I'm getting a pedicure treat"" feeling while you're using it, and who doesn't want to treat themselves? I love this body scrub. It makes my skin feel and look summer ready. I am always looking for a scrub that can work well for my skin. This one does make my skin look and feel smoother right away. Works well and a little goes a long way! So, me and my husband both have some skin issues and have tried a lot of things. Both oily skin and some occasional adult break outs. Since using this we have had less break outs and less oily skin. This espically helps my husband for when  he comes in from work and has all that black grim stuff bad in his pores. Just so glad we bought and came on time and no damages. Great quality product! Great body scrub. The scent is non existent which is nice because I don't want to be adding any extra chemicals to my skin care routine. This scrub does a great job exfoliating and leaving my skin moisturized after use. I love using this product as my skin feels fresh and renewed after use. This scrub is fabulous! Feels amazing as it exfoliates, definitely happy with this scrub. It definitely does what it says. A little goes a long way which is nice as you know it's doing it's job. It is grey when it's being applied but runs clear when rinsed. Skin feels outrageously soft and fresh. Very pleased. I bought three of them!! This scrub introduced me to activated charcoal and it's marvelous. It made my skin incredibly smooth without feeling too rough when I applied it. To other customers: rub your skin well with a sponge after usage because charcoal leaves a bit of a blackish color. Still, I'm going to buy this again for certain. I love anything Majestic Pure but I really love this charcoal scrub. I have a very fair complexion with sensitive skin but this charcoal scrub was perfect. I could tell as soon as I washed it off that it had exfoliated and it left my face very soft. It is odor free and does not leave your face greasy or oily. I would definitely recommend this charcoal scrub and I will definitely be purchasing this again!! I bought the charcoal scrub to help get the dry skin off my legs so I can apply fake tan. This stuff works great! I like how it gets rid of my dead skin and leaves me moisturized. My tanning lotion glides on perfect after this! I've only used it once so far since I got it today but I really like it! It makes my skin feel soft since it has oils in it too. I bought it for ingrown hairs on my arms and hopefully it helps! I'll just have to see with more use. So far I love it! This is a loose powder scrub, I like that I can scoop out the amount needed and add a little water and scrub away! I have been using it on my legs and the dry skin on my arms and have seen an improvement! Great product for the price. I'm a long-time user of the Saint Ives apricot scrub, after using this scrub for almost a week I have noticed less oil on my nose and my skin is super soft.  Recently I also got sunburned and my skin peeled so I used the scrub and it helped. Charcoal seems to be the new Beauty secret this year, and I can see why. This stuff really does work. And it doesn’t have a hmarsh chemical smells that most products do......I am certainly pleased with my purchase, a great match for the money I have very sensitive skin and cant really find a scrub to use on my face without me breaking out! I have finally found one that my dermatologist recommended. After two treatments, my skin already looked better! This is one of the best body scrubs I've ever used. Leaves my skin feeling moist and smooth. I love my new activated charcoal body scrub, it exfoliates my skin so well and leaves my body nice and soft! I use it on my face as well and it really helps clear my pores! I have tried others and nothing compares to this scrub! I really love this scrub! I use it on my face and body and I have oily, mild-moderate acne prone skin. I did not experience problems with the charcoal not washing off. After use, my skin feels like I just got an acid peel. It does not make me break out (many products I try do). In fact, I would say it heals minor blemishes. This charcoal scrub leaves my skin so soft and smooth. I use on face and body and I feel so smooth and hydrated after each use. The blemishes I have on my back seem to be improving since using this product. Works great on both my face and body. Leaves my skin nice and smooth yet hydrated. It's the perfect texture to remove any excess skin buildup. It lasts quite a while since I only use it once a week which is nice. Was a little hesitant about the charcoal on my skin but was pleasantly surprised! This is an awesome BODY scrub! The salt is amazing for exfoliating leaves skin very soft, it has natural oils in it too, coconut/jojoba/kukui nut, so better used in the body. Especially liked how my bikini line and inner thighs felt, soft and moisturized! This charcoal scrub worked great on my teenage sons oily acne skin. It was gentle enough on his skin to not leave it red but powerful enough to clear up his skin. This is a unique scrub, I love the black color compared to all the pinks you usually get with scrubs. The product works well. My skin feels softer and noticed my skin clearing up a little bit. Love this stuff! It exfoliates your skin very well without it being harsh on your skin. I have used this on my face, legs, and arms, and it leaves my skin feeling so soft and not oily at all. I will be buying more in the future. My face has never been softer 😊 I freakin' LOVE THIS STUFF!!!!!!!!!!!! Awesome scrub. I really love to use it daily because it makes me feel so clean and smooth. A lot goes a long way so it's definitely a good buy and you get your money's worth. WoW! This is an Amazing scrub! Very exfoliating! You only need a small amount.  My skin was clean & super soft after using! Very happy with this scrub. It definitely does what it says. I will say to keep in mind if you have any wounds the salt in this will dying. I made that mistake not thinking. There is also a residue bit I figured out just to use it sparingly. Very pleased and will repurchase. I've heard so much about charcoal products lately and I was really excited when I purchased this product. I've recently moved half way across the country and my skin is paying the price. This scrub has left my harsh feeling skin feeling refreshed and nice and soft. It was a learning curve trying to figure out how much I needed to use, but a little goes a long way. Would recommend this even to the most skeptical person! My skin is so soft after using this charcoal especially my feet. When cleaning my face with the scrub I used my facial brush and got wonderful results. The scrub was nice but it can sting a little bit if you have some inflammation or cuts on your skin. I felt that it helped my rashes heal a bit faster. This product works great!!  A little bit goes a long way!  It leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.  I will be re buying this as soon as I run out! Really like this scrub. Adds a glow to the skin without hurting it. Used on face and body. Bought a second one to share with my sister. Living in a subtropical climate I bought this product to help exfoliate legs since it's constantly ""shorts"" season here. After one use my skin was so soft, softer than using my expensive Lush scrubs. Great value! This stuff is awesome! It's made my elbows, knees and feet so smooth. I use it on my face 2x a week to keep my skin looking hydrated. I love this product! It has made my face, chest and back so clear and soft! The packaging is great too. It's worth the money! Awesome scrub. I use it on my legs and feet the most. Especially during the summer, when my feet get the extra calluses. Feels great on the skin. I needed a more affordable alternative to Volcanic Ash scrub and this is wonderful! It does not have a harsh scent or too perfume like so my husband uses it as well. It gets rid of the dead skin and leaves it clean, soft, and hydrated. This is my new favorite scrub! Oh, and you don't have to use much so it should last quite a while depending on how often you use. Love this so much!!!!! First time I tried this my skin felt amazing. It took the dead skin off and my skin felt health like a baby skin Thank you I used this on my face and neck it feels so smooth good product, I can't wait to try it on my feet I have been looking for something to help revive my skin. This seems to be the answer so far my face and skin is much smoother and toned. I was a little worried about trying something with so dark a color that it might turn my skin gray.  BUT.  I really like how it makes my skin feel.  My daughters really like it as well.  Just make sure to close your mouth when you use it or you might be tasting salt.  The crystals are actually pretty big. Face is smooth and soft after! Love it I'm so glad I purchased this product. This is my first time using a charcoal scrub and despite the consistency my face feels so soft! I will adding this to my weekly routine!!! I have really bad skin and this product has helped clear up my skin the most. I love that it doesn't smell like anything. It gets my face really clean after a long day of work very rich body scrub i would highly recommend this product worth every penny Skin feels great after using this, great product!! I had an A W F U L breakout when this stuff came in the mail. After using everyday (sometimes twice on gym days) I'm noticing the break out is going away faster than just using my normal face wash! My face is always so soft and my face doesn't get as oily as fast when I use this. Would definitely recommend! Better than I expected! My face and skin look amazing after using this! I use a very light face wash afterwords, if not, you can see charcoal residue. Just what I need and quick delivery. Great exfoliating scrub, I just used it on my face. When I rinsed my face, it felt so smooth. I didn't even have to apply moisturizer. I'm definitely using this 2-3 times a week. Would highly recommend. This does wonders!!! Use it everywhere I sometimes mix it into my face washGreat for body acne too Awesome! Nothing else needs to be written! Prepare for clean up, but it's worth it. It truly works great!! I used this product on my hands. When I first opened the jar I noticed how good it smelled. I scrubbed my hands with it and after they were scrubbed, rinsed, and dried I could instantly tell how soft and smooth my hands felt. I think I would try it on my feet next as I they could use some softening up as well! I love this. Makes your face feel so healthy Great product Amazing scrub. After using for a week I could feel my skin clear up and brighten and I can notice the difference. Will recommend to friends. Awesome ! I absolutely love the way my skin feels after using this product Amazing! good I just used this scrub, absolutely wonderful. A great exfoliant on my body and feet. It left my skin so smooth!! I would highly recommend this product. Works great!  Well worth the money Amazing facial scrub, will buy again for sure! Feels great and works so well Love this product...keeps my face soft and smooth. My face and skin felt amazing after using this charcoal scrub!! It has quickly become a favorite part of my routine. I really like this product. Very easy to use and has a pleasant smell. It is a great exfoliant and does not leave your skin too oily. After you rinse it off your skin is very soft and stays moisturized. Works great! Came earlier than expected and the product works. Only issue is the package is when the package arrived  it appeared to be soaked in essential oils. Not sure if the altitude difference affected that or not when it was arriving. This stuff is amazing! I had been wanting to try a charcoal based product for my skin and this was my first purchase. Excellent scrub, no funky smells or leftover residue. Will definitely purchase again! A little goes a long way! Used product on body and also face. Love the way it makes my skin feel. So soft and refreshed. Will Buy product again Love it very pleasant Its a great product. My skin feels refreshed. Had read about natural Charcoal scrubs and wanted to try it. Picked this as I have used Majestic Pure products in the past. This turned out very good quality and the skin feels very fresh after using it.  Highly recommend to anyone wanting to give it a try for smooth wrinkle free skin. I have been dying to try a charcoal scrub since it seems to be the biggest fad in beauty products. Majestic's scrub smells fantastic. It has a very clean and light scent. I applied my scrub in the shower and this stuff works great! It's super gritty but not harsh on the body so it does a good job exfoliating. I hate when I get a scrub and they are more oily than gritty but that wasn't the case with Majestic's charcoal scrub! I will definitely be buying more! This is a great scrub and I love that you can use it on your face as well.  Charcoal is a wonderful cleaning agent.  Skin felt smooth after I was done.  The best part no awful smell that lingers all day. My skin feels amazing ! Soft as a baby!! I love this stuff ! Absolutely in love with this. Makes my skin glow and feel very soft. My skin feels better for a few days after using it. Don't get it in your mouth or eyes; it is salty lol. Perfect 👌🏾 It was just what I was looking for. Love this scrub, it's gentle but, not to rough Really does wonders Good This is a great scrub. It makes your skin feel super soft after using it. The salt granules help to deep clean and remove blackheads and deadskin. I like that I can use this all over my face and body and that it's all natural. I have never used anything special on my face or body. At 36, I am kinda scared to. People always say I have beautiful skin- and some weirdo even try to touch it- but i use the same soap that I use on my body. I took  a chance and used this, and i was really surprised. My skin felt rejuvenated and refreshed afterwards. I used it after a 5 hour gym session, so needless to say, I had some barnacles that needed to be tended to. My skin felt clean and my pores felt alive. It even left a glow and didn't dry out my skin. I love the fact that it was all natural and there were no chemicals that could seep into my body. Now of course, my daughter and her friends wants to use it, so I have to buy more..Kids I don't usually use any scrubs on my face but have heard great things about the charcoal scrub so i thought i would give it a try because I work out a lot and the constant sweating was leaving me with break outs. Honestly i was a little skeptical at first rubbing ""charcoal"" on my face but I am so glad I tried it because it was amazing! My 3 year old son and I used the scrub and were amazed at the results right away. Our skin was as soft as a babies bottom and it gave us this really clean glow. I felt like my pours were clean for the very first time! I will absolutely use every last drop of this scrub and would highly recommend it to everyone! This is a great scrub to use, especially if you dry brush before your shower. My skin feels smooth and soft. This is the third Majestic Pure product I've tried and will try more as I've liked everything I've used. This stuff is FANTASTIC. It leaves your face feeling super clean and soft. So glad I took a chance and bought it. The charcoal scrub arrived and was packaged very nicely.  After opening I discovered no smell which was a plus for me.  I used the scrub on my arms. I used a circular motion on my damp skin. The container days you can use a scrub brush but i didn't seed the needed because the circular motion was enough for me.  After i finished scrubbing,  i rinsed it off with warm water and c really liked how it made my skin feel. I bought this for my pre-teen daughter because she has acne. I read that charcoal scrubs works well to clean the skin and help reduce acne. We have noticed her face is clearing up and her skin is softer than it was before starting this product. If she is happy so is mommy. Majestic Pure Charcoal Scrub is by far the absolute best body scrub I have ever used!!! No joke, this is my favorite scrub (and I've tried hundreds)! There is no scent which I personally like because I'm sensitive to strong scents. I also have very sensitive skin and thankfully this does not irritate it at all. It does the complete opposite. I swear my skin loves it and says thank you every time I use it! It feels great when you're using it and also after each use. My skin is nourished and moisturized. I use it on my entire body every other day. The Majestic Pure Himalayan Scrub so when I say this I thought I would give it a try. While the Himalayan Scrub is still an all time favorite this comes in a close second. It has many of the things I love about the Himalayan Scrub - fine grain texture, moisturizing as well as a great exfoliator. However, as it is Charcoal it lack a scent. This will definitely remain a staple item in my shower! Amazing product : VERY SATISFIED - will order again from this Vendor Omg this Charcoal Scrub is so amazing. It feels wonderful and works. You can get yours here https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/ya/ref=yo_ii_bia_view?ie=UTF8&ac=bia&reorder_params=B01MYA4Q1X%2C114-3895227-6115460 Love this Charcoal Scrub by Majestic Pure.  I love scrubs!  I love scented scrubs,  but there are times I don't want a scent to compete with the perfume I am planning on wearing. This one is perfect.Leaves my skin smooth,  soft to touch.  I always moisturizer after using,  but even without a lotion, the oils in this scrub still leave my skin feeling moist.Charcoal is really good for skin,  it helps draw out impurities and dissolve blackheads. This scrub will not disappoint. Looovveeee this scrub! :) Ive been using it for a few weeks now and I really like how it makes my face feel soft! And I feel like its helped my skin with break outs as well! I've only used this product on my face, and love the smooth and soft feeling I'm left with afterwards! It's a great facial scrub, and moisturizer. I do it probably twice a week, and would do it every night if I could. Love how this makes my skin feel. After only TWO uses there is definitely a noticeably dramatic difference in my overall skin health & complexion. Having oily skin, this does not dry my skin out nor do I even need to apply any moisturizer after use. My makeup looks more natural than ever (no heavy coverage needed). Rating this product 5 STARS!!!!! A MUST HAVE Charcoal body scrub is great for detoxing your skin. I use it once a week, use other scrubs in between. I recommend to try it! I've only been using this deep cleanse exfoliating antitoxin face and body scrub for 2 days.  I can already see the Improvement it's made to my skin.  I just love this product and look forward to buying more from this seller. I chose a 5 star review because this scrub is awesome! It hasn't no scent which is nice for me, it's gritty enough to really take dead skin off of your body. I used it on my feet, before I did my own pedicure. It made a world of difference! The only thing is, it left a greasy ring in my tub but came clean after one wash, which is usual. Be careful because it can be slippery. But you body will feel baby soft afterwords. And you don't need a whole lot to get the job done. I am so happy with this! This makes my face feel like my 9 month old's tush. I use a facial cleanser first, then the scrub. It doesn't take a large amount so it lasts a long time. I just received this charcoal scrub today and it's superb!! I used it tonight. My skin in glowing and it'd so smooth. I didn't think I would have these results with the first use, but I did. I wish I would have taken a before shot for comparison but it is a miracle scrub! I have been using this scrub on my body and face. It doesn't dry the skin out, but instead deep cleans and adds moisture. My skin feels silky and exfoliated after I shower with this, which is exactly how I like to feel.I started using it on my face, hoping to get rid of blackheads and it didn't disappoint. It has unclogged the pores on my nose. My nose has always been a problem-area for me, but I notice a difference when I remember to use this. A little goes a long way and I have hardly put a dent in the jar, even though I have been using it for a few weeks.It arrived quickly and was packaged with a safety seal. I love that the jar is clear, too, because I like to see what I am getting before I use it. The consistency is soft and small, not thick and chunky, making it easy to wash with. It is like polishing your skin, and you can't go wrong with that! Impressed with this product. It was a little messy to apply, but I didn't use a Body brush as recommended. Left my skin feeling soft and silky- but not oily. *not tested on animals* My face is sensitive so I was hesitant to try this scrub. I used it at night before I went to bed and it left my face glowing. The first time I used it my face felt rough in spot but after that it was really smooth. It has helped my face and chest clear up from acne so much in just a short period of time. This is the most wonderful scrub. I love that it is a face and body scrub. I love this company they are all natural and have several great products. The active charcoal could stain so I mostly use it in the shower. It does a great job cleaning the dirt and oil from your skin. It also helps pull impurities out and reduce the size of your pores. The scrub does make your face look brighter and refreshed. It doesn't irritate my face at all and I use it a couple times a week.  It is really a great product for a detox especially if you wear a lot of makeup. I also love using it on my legs and it helps me to not get razor burn so easily.  If your looking for a scrub this is definitely one you want to try. I love body scrubs and I am always on the look out for new ones to try. Recently I have become more aware of the beneficial properties of using charcoal in my beauty routine. This Majestic Pure Body Scrub with Charcoal was a great find. When I opened the jar I was pleasantly surprised to find it had no smell. One of the things I like most about this product is that I can use it for both. I have used both in the shower and to wash my face. The consistency is fine so it is a gently scrub. It is black so be startled if seems to leave a ring in your shower. It is easy to clean but just needs a little extra spritz before leaving the shower. I usually can't use exfoliating scrubs, or anything rough on my face, but I decided to give this Activated Charcoal Scrub a try,  and boy was I surprised. Instead of my face stinging afterward like it usually does when I've tried an exfoliator, it felt so super soft and clean. I have continued using it daily, and my face feels amazing, with no blemishes at all. It comes in a good size bottle, so it should last a while, but I will definitely be ordering more when I start getting low. I have purchased quiet a few products by Majestic Pure, and have yet to find one that I haven't loved! If you haven't tried this stuff, you're missing out! I actually bought this for my wife, but I decided to use it since I'm one of those guys cursed with sensitive skin, ingrown hair ""disease"" (note: switch to an old fashioned safety razor and your life will be MUCH better), etc. In the end, my skin was baby butt smooth and felt great. I had no major breakouts after use, no burns, no splotches, etc. Sadly, my wife hasn't used it once as I have claimed it as my own.Sadly, as a guy, I'll admit I'll be buying more for myself.Oh, and one piece of advice: Don't go ""aaahhhhh"" while scrubbing, the salt doesn't taste that great... Majestic Pure is a brand that I've been watching for a couple of months now, after enjoying the peppermint oil I purchased by them. Having read about activated charcoal and its toxin absorbing qualities, I wanted to give this scrub a try... I was honestly worried about a scrub being too harsh on my already problematic face. It's been recently breaking out due to stress/bad eating choices. Interestingly enough, the oil content in the formula I think helped keep moisture in my face. It has a sugar granule/wet sand type of texture, with a pleasant smell and slightly oily after-feel to it. Applying it is best done on damp skin so it doesn't all fall off to the sink until you can start scrubbing motion.I feel like it is helpful in making my face look cleaner/brighter. I can definitely tell the difference from its exfoliating quality, but still have blackheads though so maybe a peeling type of mask/some pore opening treatment is due. I've been using this in the shower for about a week as a body scrub (my face is super sensitive so I haven't tried it as a face scrub). It got a good texture and the granules were pleasant to scrub without being sharp or harsh on my skin. I have been using sun screen for being outside and this really helped get that greasy residue off from using it. So far I'm very pleased with the product. The jar is a good size so that I'm not going through the whole thing quickly. I have oil, acne prone skin. I've been using this every other day and my skin feels cleaner both on my body and my face. After a week I noticed that my pores weee smaller on my face and my body acne was starting to go away. After one use I could feel it slough away dead skin and I could see the difference in my face, neck and chest with it appear brighter. The scrub is a sugar consistency and rinsed easily off. The scub has just the right amount of oil as charcoal to detox and leave your skin feeling refreshed. I'm not sure where to start...SO much good has happened to my face since using this! I use it in the morning on my clean face and the rest of the day my face is illuminated. I have tried lots and lots of high end products and nothing has had such a good impact on my face! My face is so smooth, even toned, bright and stubborn blackheads have decreased. This is not my first Majestic Pure purchase and it surely won't be the last as I have been blown away time and time again with the results! I can't wait to order this again, highly recommend!!! Very pleased with this body scrub. Not harsh on my skin like some scrubs are. Does not leave my skin feeling oily when I wash it off. I first used it on just my body, and seeing how gentle it was I used it on my face. Was not abrasive on my face at all. Left my face and body feeling soft and smooth. Do not have a strong aroma which I like bc I alway apply lotion to my skin after I bathe and I don't have to worry about two different aromas collide with each other. I was a little leery when reading a few of the reviews; however, I read how others really like this scrub.  I do too!  I have used it (carefully) on my face every other week since purchasing it.  My face is very sensitive.  I am beginning to use it more often, but not as my daily scrub.  Works great every where you can use it... feet, legs, arms, hands.  Because I did read the reviews prior to ordering, I knew that the scrub could be messy.  So I just get a small amount out of jar at a time.  No problems!  Now I just keep the jar in the shower.  I use it sometimes before shaving legs and feel this makes for an easier, smoother shave.Very glad I purchased this! This charcoal scrub works great! It is SO scrubby. It isn't a soap, it's just kind of dry with maybe a little moisture so I always wet my hands and face before using it. It is very fine and provides an excellent exfoliation without hurting my face. My face feels so clean after using this and it clears up my acne really fast. So i have really been on a Charcoal kick ever since using the teeth whitening powder (OMG) and i came across this gem, and decided for the price, even if it does do well, it still isn't too much of a loss. Well, it was worth the money. It left my skin glowing and looking like I had just come from a spa. It effectively slothed off all dead skin, and left just a hint of the oils that are in it, on my skin.Well worth the buy. I've used this on average once a week for several weeks. A few notes to point out---don't use it on your teeth! this isn't ""that"" kind of charcoal, this is for your face and body! The charcoal and ""rough"" bits in there are fantastic for getting into your pores and cleaning them out, while the coconut oil leave your skin sooooooo soft and moisturized! For my face, I use a little circular face scrubber with a dab of charcoal scrub on it, it feels so so great-but it can be messy! After I clean my face, I have to dry it completely as the coconut oil doesn't  get along with my glasses too well! The winds and cold of winter leave my skin feeling rough as an alligator. This Charcoal Body and Facial Scrub is made with dead sea salt and activated charcoal with some other ingredients that I am just going to call magic. The granules are very fine and are not as rough as some scrubs I have purchased. After just one use, the rough skin on my face was completely gone. I was shocked at how wonderful my face felt, it leaves you super moisturized and rejuvenated. I am using it every several days to scrub away dry winter skin. Tastes salty and slightly smoky, but it says for external use only so maybe try not to get it in your mouth.I received a discount on this item but that does not alter my opinion. All feedback is based on my own experience with this product. I have four daughters and between ourselves we have used a lot of facial products over the years. When I saw Majestic Pure Charcoal Body Scrub I knew I had to get it for my youngest daughter who is 26. She still has acne breakouts and sensitive skin. Over Xmas break she took activated charcoal and mixed it with glue and my husband and her put it on their noses to see if they could get the blackheads. Ha. So I knew she would love to try this scrub. She washed her face with it, it had no fragrance and no burn. She had me touch her face. She was excited and told me how soft and that it had left a film on her face that was moisturizing, not overabuntantly oily. Knowing it exfoliates and cleanses, reduces pores, helps heal acne scars and blackheads she says she is going to use it morning and night. I like it is made in the USA, she likes what it does and it feels good! Will be buying it again. This Majestic Pure Charcoal Scrub is amazing! I have always had bad acne on my face, and my face has always been oily. I use this Scrub every other night before bed. After using my skin is baby smooth, all the oiliness is gone, and my face just feels refreshed.I have been using this Scrub for about 2 weeks now. I have seen such a change in my acne! My acne has drastically reduced! I have heard that charcoal really helps with acne, but this was my first experience with it. I am super happy with this product! This works great!. My first word of caution, however, is to really be careful of how much pressure you are using. This can really take your skin off and leave you with a wonderful little sore :/ It's great at removing those dark spots under your arms, and the rough spots on elbows and knees. Really is a great product that stores easily and lasts for a long time. Even as an older adult I still get the occasional acne outbreak now and again.  When I saw the chance to give this body and facial scrub a try I had to jump at it.  I had just had a weekend of food indulgence and was dealing with the resulting facial and torso breakout.  I think I tried this product the day I got it.  LOLLike most of the body/facial scrubs I've tried in the past from Majestic Pure, it is heavy on the moisturizing aspect.  At first I was a little worried because I didn't think an anti-acne scrub would work if it had a lot of oils in it.  Boy, was I wrong.  This left my face and torso silky smooth without leaving behind an overly oily residue.  Within hours, my pimples were clearing up and, after using the product once a day for two days they were completely gone.  What an amazing find! This is one of my new favorite scrubs!! I have over ten items from Majestic Pure and this is my favorite scrub so far because of how fine the particles are. It almost feels like a sugar scrub but I also like it because it doesn't have a fragrance that I can smell. It washes down the drain perfectly and doesn't leave my shower slippery at all! I will be buying again for sure! I received this product at a discount for my honest review and that didn't have any influence on my opinion! I am loving this activated charcoal scrub.  My skin has never felt better not only does it eliminate the excess oil and impurities, but it leaves me feeling very refreshed. Even the first time I used it I could tell a huge difference and my skin feels like never before!  it has almost no odor at all and I am funny about how things smell so I usually have to wash my face after I wash my face. Not with this one, it's amazing! Thank you for this Actiated charcoal Scrub, I have been using it and it really ruff and felt like I was scratching my skin. But nope is was not it makes my face feel so wonderful!!.. and it leaves my legs feeling smooth!!.. thank you LOVE using this on my face. And lips (warning: will taste salty). I cannot believe the improvement on my skin, and it's not to harsh. My face feels better and looks better. And younger. Softer. This is great! I have seen acid that couldn't get paint off the way this cleaned my skin! Haha if you have a blemish, need it fixed quickly? Put this on and DONT follow the instructions! Haha your 1st thought after you start washing it off is ""WHY SO SERIOUS?""! It came leaking all over. It was a mess. I purchased the 100% Pure and Natural Charcoal Scrub and I am using it for my face. After the first use my skin feels extremely soft. I was shocked at how soft my face actually felt after using it for just one time but be aware that your face or body will have to be washed with a cleaner afterwards because it will look dirty from the charcoal, this is normal. I believe in the activated charcoal that is one of the ingredients as I use it for whitening my teeth. This product is a deep cleanse, exfoliate and remove toxins. It is suitable for the body as well as the body. I really like the product because it made my face feel so soft but it would have been nice if there were direction on how often to use it on the face.*I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review after testing the product. I just love the way my skin feels after using this stuff. Admittedly I thought it looked a bit gross when I first stuck my hand in it my man I was not disappointed by the outcome. I like that this can be used on my face and my body so I don't technically need two different items. It does feel gritty but I can tell that it is removing dead skin cells which is what I am going for. I have really gotten into the charcoal effects and the added bonus of the dead sea salts will keep me using this time and time again! Oil-based, but not oily. Fine-grade scrub that is gentle enough for the face, and strong enough to exfoliate smelly underarms. No sulfury smell and no heavy perfumes, just a smoothing, fresh addition to a good steamy shower or quick morning routine. Very consistent product and good amount for the price. 2:430:00This video is not intended for all audiences.

This one is fantastic and smells pretty good. I worried about a charcoal scrub having a strong smell but it doesn’t. It dissolves nicely in the shower and leaves my skin soft. The scrub is a dark grey/black color and the texture is a fine grind. This is not the first Majestic Pure body product I have used, and as with the others, I am very happy with the quality and results. I have used a lot of scrubs and this one is by far my favorite, makes my face so smooth after every use. I usually apply shea moistures mud mask after I use this scrub and it makes my skin so soft. It kind of hurts your face when you first rub it on your skin but you will get used to it and it's worth it, immediate results. I haven't seen an improvement on acne or dark spots yet though but I've only been using it for about 3 weeks now. The product arrived in great condition and on time. The charcoal scrub feels like most scrubs but this one when applied to my face isn't as rough. Its black/grey has some oil in it and doesn't appear to have a scent.I find most scrubs the exfoliate can be sharp feeling and I've had small cuts on my face. This product however doesn't cut my face and doesn't dry it out either. My face feels as sooth as a baby bottom and so far after a weeks of use I haven't broke out. I've also applied this product on my legs and feet and again, I've never felt them so smooth! I definitely recommend this product! I'm so happy! I have been using the charcoal body and facial scrub for about 2 weeks now and I love it! It makes my skin very soft and clear of black heads. I see it is also making a difference in my acne marks. I will definitely buy this again once the tub I have runs out. My *only* negative comment would be that quantity was less than expected for the price. It is a little abrasive, which would turn some people off, but I actually like that about the product because I feel like it's really sloughing off the dead skin cells. It is a ""scrub"" after all. Though it's a little messy to use (using dry on wet skin) it feels FANTASTIC!!  Leaves my face feeling clean and soft, not over dry.  I did not expect to like this as much as I do, but my skin feels and looks good when I use it.  I will be ordering more! I love this company!! Another product I recommend. I use activated charcoal for anytime I have an upset stomach. So I figured it would be great on the skin. I love this scrub. I've been using it about 2x a week. It doesn't smell like much of anything but my face is so smooth after. Helps keep the acne at Bay. I have used this on my face and my hands.  In the winter time my hands get very very dry.  I used this for the first time.  I have used other products, lotions(have to keep applying many times daily), mary kay soft hands (makes my hands soft, but once lotion is applied irritates them) and nothing has made my hands feel softer without also irritating them.  This product makes them soft with no irritation!!  I love it!  You didn't have to use much product at all.  I did dampen my face and hands before using.  I was careful to not get it in my eyes.  It did get it on my lips, so it obviously had a salty taste, but only until I washed it off. Love this stuff. I used it on my face and body and my face felt so smooth and soft. Smells good too. This was an interesting try. It was very abrasive without hurting my skin. I my skin got a thorough deep cleaning with a nice and moisturizer left after I rinsed my face off. Once the moisturizer soaked in my face felt very soft and smooth. In sort I'm sold in this one! I highly recommend Charcoal Scrub! This stuff works great! I love the deep cleaning with the scrub and charcoal. Noticeable difference in complexion. I suggest to use it while in the shower for the extra deep clean versus a surface wash at the sink. This has a very light almost powdery scent, it's not a bad smell, quite pleasant. It works well to exfoliate my dry skin. I'm used to buying the cheap exfoliatant from Walmart that is all wet, this is dry and thick grain. While applying the scrub, it leaves your skin kind of greasy but washes off, I assume it's for the moisturizing aspect of it. The only thing I didn't really like was that it turned me black, it was in all the hair follicles and wrinkles and wouldn't wash away. I would suggest using this before you lather up so it takes away the color. Amazing! I recommend this item. Majestic Pure Charcoal Scrub is an awesome scrub that leaves the skin feeling clean and smooth after each use.  This scrub has Dead Sea Salts in it which has many of the minerals that our body needs.  It also comes with a money back guarantee which basically makes it no risk to try.  I really love it and would highly recommend. This scrub is great. It isn't sticky and messy, and it left my skin feeling great. It felt clean in a non chemical way. I've really noticed a change in my skin since I started using it. It is really very smooth If I had known how great this product is, I'd have bought several jars during the ""Lightning Deals"" event that made me decide to try it. I'm well over 50 and I was concerned that it would dry my skin or be too harsh, so I was skeptical, despite the rave reviews. But the results are truly amazing. I couldn't be more pleased. I have used this twice now and i love it, you can feel it working. It smells nice and doesn't leave my skin dry or oily. I would recomend it to anyone! You can definatly tell a difference when you use it. I got this as a face scrub, but the residue it leaves is icky. Instead, I'm using as a body scrub and love it. It makes my skin feel lovely and manages to clean off any grossness following a workout, gardening, etc. I have very very sensitive skin and have bad eczema. I've always used plain sea salt to help control my eczema but I thought to try this. I (very) gently exfoliate my eczema patch in the shower and leave the salt for as long as I can stand. I then rinse it off. The combination of charcoal, very fine salt and moisturising oils have helped clear my eczema. This Charcoal Body Scrub is fantastic! While I have only used it a few times over the last couple of days I have noticed a considerable difference in my very dry winter skin. It has left my skin smooth and soft without being harsh or rough to use. Also my teenage son has used it and almost overnight his acne has cleared. That is amazing, we have tried everything with very little results and this worked quickly. I recommend only getting your fingers damp them scrub for a few minutes for the best results. I would highly recommend this product. I have really enjoyed using this body scrub. It has a very light fragrance, which I wasn't expecting, but was pleased by. The salt is a fine grit and feels great on your skin- exfoliates without being too rough like some others I've tried. My skin feels so soft and silky after using this. I typically use lotion daily after a shower, but don't even need it when using this product! You don't need to use much each time, so the tub will last awhile too. I love using facial scrubs and sometimes I even use them on my feet, only when I can sit still for the time needed! I have been using this charcoal scrub for about a month now and love the results. I wasn't sure of how it would make my skin feel since I sometimes have sensitive skin. I can feel it cleansing without being abrasive which is really nice. Plus it leaves my skin feel super soft! I am really happy I gave this product a chance. I received this item as a promotional item. What a great feel this gives my skin. I use daily and wonder how I survived all these years prior to purchasing this! I love this product. It's soft enough to use on my face but at the same time it rough enough to use on tougher skin like your back. I love the way my skin feels after using this product. Since I have become pregnant my skin has become quite dry, lotions and soaps just aren't enough but after a few uses of this my legs were finally smooth again. I would highly recommend this face and body scrub. Great scrub, leaves skin feeling clean and refreshed. DO NOT PUT NEAR EYES! Love love love this product!! Leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth without a harsh ""sandpaper has just been used"" feeling other scrubs tend to leave.  No smell so great for men also. I struggle with blackheads in my back and the charcoal scrubs helps me manage that!!  I use 3 times a week and that is plenty. Awesome product!! This works miracles it got rid of my dark acne scars and the texture of my skin as improved drastically. This stuff is better than using the Biore charcoal scrub you could feel the chemicals in that one but this is all natural which is amazing. works great Great body scrub! will buy again. I love the way my skin feels after using this scrub. I use this product every other day on my face.  My skin felt softer after 1st use. I will no doubt be a repeat buyer. Got this charcoal scrub.  I really am happy with the size of the scrub in the product.  Sometimes you get some with scrubs that are too large.  My skin felt soft and smooth after  use. It is a great texture. Used it on my face and left it so smooth. Accidentally got some in my mouth and it super salty, I will definitely be more careful next time. Overall one of the best scrub recipes I've used. Great product!  Removed all oil from my face leaves skin feeling amazingly smooth and rejuvenated! will purchase again This face scrub works amazing. Makes your skin very soft, and clears up acne very well I love it! I use it about every other day mostly on my face in the shower and I don't know if it was this or something else but when I started using this my face cleared up beautifully! this works great on your body and face, love it Love this stuff. Nice and scrubby. Leaves you feeling soft and silky. NICE FEELING.....FEELS LIKE IT TAKES OFF ALL THE DEAD SKIN CELLS OFF MY FACE!!!! It made my skin feel smooth after the first use. It gently exfoliates all the dead skin. I usually use it for my face to keep it fresh. Love this!!! Great for a lol scrub too!!!! Only used it once so I will update! It goes on rough but leaves your skin feeling so soft.  I was very hesitant about how it would smell but is not smelly at all. scrub leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft! Most scrubs I do not put on my face becuase they make them too oily. The charcol is good for your face becuase it dosnt leave it feeling too oily. I love how my face feels, plus I can see a difference in my face This is a must have. I highly suggest spending the money on this. It is life changing! Cleanses and removes excess dead skin. Leaves your face feeling smooth and oil free So good, you will see the result just in 3 days"
B00FZESMKG," Love it! Works great! I've been using this product for over a year now. I really like the new container! They keep changing the container, and The last batch I received was in sort of pump that I did not like at all. You couldn't control how much came out very well, and a little of this goes a long way. I prefer this current tube.I like that there are no weird ingredients and that the product still gets your face clean without over drying! I have a huge rotation of skin care products that I use. Seriously. I honestly have different products that I use depending on the season, weather, foods I’m eating, workout plans I’m on, whatever differences in my life there are, you better believe there is going to be a skincare product in my bathroom that will work for it. I’ve been looking for something gentle and mild that will also help get rid of a recent bout of acne to replace Cetaphil (which I’ve used for years, but has recently decided to stop working for me) and I found mention of the Christina Moss face wash on a beauty blog. I hopped over to Amazon and read through the reviews, looking for mention of any negative side effects and decided to give it a red hot shot. It came rather quickly in the mail, and I started using it the very night that I got it. It cleansed my skin pretty well, got rid of excess makeup that I hadn’t gotten off, and made my skin feel taut but not too tight. I used it with this new TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution for Advanced Acne Treatment - All Natural Acne Spot Treatment - Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back! (60ml) that I recently got to improve my blemishes. After about ten days, while inspecting my face with a magnified mirror, I noticed a huge improvement in the amount of blemishes that were on my face, as well as the scars from old pimples that had been there for a while. The face wash is awesome at prepping your skin for the day, or for a good nights sleep to rejuvenate your skin, and the tea tree oil did a great job at shrinking the blemishes and healing the scars. I definitely recommend this face wash to anyone who wants something gentle to use on their face. This is my first organic face wash. I used it with my Clarisonic radiance brush which produce a rich lather with just a small amount of gel. It left my face feeling super clean and smooth. It’s been about 12 hrs since I used it and haven’t experienced any irritation or breakouts. I'm impressed. I ordered this to avoid chemicals and because I have a tendency to get acne from many face washes. Not only does this not cause break outs, but it helped clear up a break out from a previous face wash issue. What I was NOT expecting was it to remove my make up. It removed eye liner and even mascara without much work at all. To me it works better than actual make up remover. I am SUPER happy with this purchase and recommend it. I have been using this product for over a year.  I have VERY acne prone skin and this keeps it under control.  I think with sensitive skin, less is more and this product has great quality, safe ingredients and removes makeup so well. It is a bit drying, so I just use a really good moisturizer with it.  Also, in the winter I only use it in the evening, because it removes makeup so well, while I use a more moisturizing face wash in the morning.  I use it morning and evening in the summer.  I also use the toner and facial moisturizer and love them as well!  Wonderful products! I have been using this cleanser for a few weeks now and love it. The scent is fresh and reminds me of being at a spa. My skin is clean, pores are smaller, and overall feels revived. I will be purchasing again. Having recently gotten into organic skin products, I was on the search for a quality face wash. I am so glad I gave this product a shot! It is gentle yet effective. And the best part is that a little goes a long way. Will definitely purchase again! I have Rosacea and this is the only cleanser that I have tried in the past 20 plus years that DOES NOT make it worse!  Thank you. Oh, and a little does go a long way.... it washes clean and feel good after wash face. best face wash I've ever used. perfect clean This is an amazing product. Leaves my skin feeling so clean, and I love the fact that its organic and cruelty free.  I will definitely purchase again.. I wanted to try something that was organic and not as expensive as my Veda products. Really love how it gets your makeup off and your skin feels clean. No need for a goner. Because you only need a little for each use, it is lasting quite a long time.  Great buy and works well too.  Does leave your skin a little dry but, is as expected. Great product! I have dry, sensitive, and acne prone skin-- It cleans my skin without drying it out-- a very challenging feat! Love this moisturizer. As somebody who has never used the same facial cleanser twice, I think I could stick to this one. The organic, natural ingredients are clean and smells natural with no artificial perfumes. By far the best for my sensitive skin. Seen improvement within days of use.  No more acne, clear pores, and smooth skin. Would definitely recommend... So far it's working great, gets my makeup off even and I feel clean and natural. I love the facial wash after using it my face feels great and smooth I highly recommend this product Great product, leaves skin feeling resfreshed and clean. Doesnt overdry your skin. I absolutely LOVE this product! It's hands down my most favorite product I use on my face! I have been using this product now for about 5-6 months and have seen some amazing results from using it! I don't have perfect skin, but I don't have horrible skin! I have pimples that pop up every now and then! But, before using this inwould have had 5-10 pimples at a time. This product cleans my face and gives in a nice clean feeling! It takes very little amount to clean your face! I use it morning and night! I have been using it for about 5-6 months and still have a forth of the bottle left... So it last along time! Another thing I like is the smell! It's such a refreshing smell! I would recommend this product to anyone! I can't wait to try the moisturizer! I love this product. It is refreshing and leaves my skin soft. I would like to try more products. so far I'm happy with this face wash.  It truly doesn't have any garbage in it and I'm glad they are keeping it that way.  No chemicals and all natural.  will buy again I love this facial wash for its smooth feel, and silky finish.  I will order it again and again. I love the facial wash,  just a small amount goes a long way,  and it makes my skin feel soft. Feels great on skin Amazing product !!! One of the greatest face washes I've ever used. I noticed a difference from day one, and my skin has improved ever since. Its been about two weeks, and my skin is almost completely clear. I'm so happy. We started using this face wash last year (both my husband and I use it). We have sensitive skin and my husband is particularly sensitive because he has oily skin that breaks out with harsh products, scrubs etc. In addition to that we are conscious of the ingredients and Christina Moss Naturals Facial Wash is exactly that. Free of all the chemicals in other products and 100% natural. Really like it and will keep ordering it while we live in the US. Sadly when we move back to Australia we won't be able to unless there is a change in their shipping. Great product.  Cleans without drying and works on all types of skin.  You only need a pea size amount.  Highly recommend it. It was the most expensive face wash I'd ever bought... and the best by so, so far, that I'll be buying it as long as they sell it! I've been using it for the past three months (close to it, anyway), and I'm only half-way through the bottle. Great stuff.Note: If you're like me, you /will/ break out the first few days of using this stuff. I stopped using it and considered returning it, but was advised to try for a week longer before giving up. And I stopped breaking out... and my acne I had previously is almost completely gone. Love it. Love this product! Works great! Leaves my skin feeling very smooth and clean! Smells great too! Bought for my BF, he really likes it. Bought this for my son who is extremely happy with this product.  Will purchase again. At first...I saw the tiny bottle and thought I had over paid for what I got.  Its true, a little goes a long way so I assume this bottle will last me 6 months.  Love it! Very sensitive on skin and very effective. Smells great. I look forward to using this every day!! love love love this face wash I love this facial wash! All you need is a tiny bit and it covers well. It also smells wonderful. I highly recommend this product. This stuff is absolutely fantastic! I really like how gentle the formula is on my skin, and the scent is refreshing but light. Most cleansers leave residue after I have rinsed them off, but not this one! Once I rinse, I just have clean and bare skin -- ready to soak up some moisturizer. I have dry but acne-prone skin and it's been nice and clear after using this for a couple weeks.It was a little bit expensive for me, but I was pleasantly surprised to see how little I use... It's concentrated and thin, so I think this will last me a nice long time.Really ecstatic with this purchase! Absolutely amazing product. My face has never felt/looked better. I love this facial wash. Its so light and leaves my face feeling clean and smooth. I have a sensitive and dry skin. It works just perfectly fine to me. It's even better than a product that costs few times higher than its. it is a really good product Easy on the skin, organic, and very simple. I enjoy simple and natural products. This leaves my skin feeling great and not dry like other face washes. Bottle looks a little small at first  but a little bit goes a loooong way. It smells great too! I really like this face wash. It cleans well and makes my skin feel smooth and firm. I can definitely see an improvement in the texture and plan to continue using it. Haven't used to long but I like it.  It doesn't clog pores, but unsure about its effect on breakouts. Wonderful natural wash. Smells good.Will dry out your skin, so just make sure you use a moisturizer afterwards. I love this face wash! It cleanses my face so well, removes all my make up and my face doesn't feel dry at all! I recommend this product :-D This face wash is fantastic. I bought it to use with my mia clarisonic and it's perfect. A little bit goes a long way and my skin is better than ever. I noticed the difference immediately. Very high quality and wonderful cleanser for the money.  Makes skin feel soft and hydrated and clean.  Would buy again. great product! This is a brilliant product that I recommend for anyone experiencing mild to moderate acne. I've had what I would consider mild acne since I was about 14 and this is one of the best facial washes I've used. I use it twice a day, once during my morning shower and once before bed. The facial wash has a very pleasant scent and leaves one's face feeling immediately clean after use. After about 15 minutes, your face will feel noticeably dryer, which some users have described as a ""tight"" feeling. This is a feeling that accompanies pretty much every product designed to clean ones pores and prevent acne. The dryness, for me, is certainly preferable to the feeling of a greasy, unclean face.After about a week, I saw a noticeable improvement in the severity of my acne. Depending on the severity, this product can be used with other cleaners and prescription gels (what I do) or on its own. I've noticed that If I stop using my prescription medication but only use this facial wash, I experience only minor breakouts. Nothing like what would happen before I started using this product. Would definitely recommend. Great, product i will buy it again! I'm a typical guy when it comes to daily grooming.  I care about my appearance, but I don't have some detailed, lengthy routine I follow each day.  I was simply looking for an effective, mild face wash that wouldn't irritate my skin.  I have sensitive skin and psoriasis, so finding products that fit that description can often be a problem.  I recently stumbled across this product on the internet when I was searching for a better face wash for sensitive skin.  I read several of the reviews on here and decided to give it a try...and I'm glad I did.It cleans well and doesn't cause me any irritation or dryness.  My face just feels clean and comfortable after I rinse it off.  I've used many different brands of products over the years to wash my face and none of them have ever performed this well, regardless of their price tag or what professional recommended them.  My skin looks and feels healthier, and I've only been using this for a couple of weeks.  It feels good to finally look forward to washing my face. Love the rosemary smell. Great product! Very efficient. I tiny quantity will suffice. I love it, wild but can make my face clean. I would recommend this product, great scent, soft feel and face feels clean Love love love this face wash! It makes my skin feel super clean and I love that it's organic! You won't be disappointed! close my open pores, give me an extra hidratation, really balance my skin, i love it.. Excellent organic product.! I love this product! This face wash is HEAVEN SENT!!!!! Before using this cleanser I always used chemical filled face washes as well as moisturizers and all they did was dry out my skin and not exactly help with my acne. I decided to finally go the natural route for my skin, and wow I am so glad I did. This face wash is the definition of perfection in my eyes, it does not dry out my skin it cleans it so well and makes my skin feel so so so soft! (my skin type is somewhat dry with acne) My skin really does feel clean after I use this. I have noticed my acne has improved drastically as well! I am 20 years old and I do not have horrible skin but I do suffer from acne and this face wash has helped it so much! I bought this face wash in November of 2014, and it is now about to be April 2015 and I am going to have to by my second bottle with in the next two weeks or so.....It has lasted me forever! You only need a dime size amount in your hand and it suds up so well. I will never use a different face wash, so please NEVER CHANGE this formula and NEVER STOP making this face wash Christina Moss!!! Im in love! I highly recommend this face wash to anyone who is looking for a natural organic option! You will love it! Also, the moisturizer goes AMAZING with this! I hope this is helpful for anyone who would like to purchase this wonderful product, you will not regret it! Leaves behind a tingly sensation and really wakes me up in the morning. Great product! This wash foams nicely and cleans gently. Terrific, effective, feels great! Love your product! Really good product Great stuff! Great value for this product! Facial wash cleanses my skin without it leaving my skin feeling tight. I have VERY sensitive skin. I also use the moisturizer. Very nice product.  Will buy again. My face feels squeaky clean with the facial wash.  I will definitely order the facial wash and moisturizer again.  Thank you Christina Moss for your excellent products. I use this product to clean my face after a long day of work. It has been working great and doesn't dry my face out at all. Very good product Skin feels great! This facial wash is awesome.  My skin feels very clean but not too dry.  It is also very concentrated so you need just a little to get the job done.  I give this 5 stars! Very good product and it works very well with the moisturizer also, I honestly think I have found a product that works very well with my skin My face feels so clean after I use this.  I even bought it for my 11 year old.  A little goes a long way! Great product! Small bottle that will last a while! Got rid of some blemishes. Noticed a difference! Great face wash! It cleans well and doesn't leave a residue.  My face feels clean and fresh.  I have very sensitive skin and finally found a facial wash that performs well. BEST facial wash I've ever found! It might smell kind of strange at the very first use, but it help with my skin well! It is ture that this product is super concentrated, do not over use it :P The facial wash is great - I immediately saw a difference in my skin - it feels and looks clean! Would definitely recommend the product for someone looking for a good, gentle and cleansing facial wash. Very nice product. Makes my skin feel clean. You need just one drop, it's really concentrated. I love it. Love washing my face with this everyday. Like that there are no bad chemicals and it is all natural! Remember, a little goes along way I love it. Very good quilty. I'll be 41 in a couple days, and I've been battling acne since my early 20s.  I was told it was hormonal so I figured there wasn't too much I could do about it.  Being put on oral medication sent me to the emergency room with an allergic reaction.  And I've been using all manner of anti-acne, anti-oily-skin washes, chock full of chemicals of course, all these years in an attempt to keep my face clear.  But recently I've been trying to reduce the amount of chemicals I use on my body and moving towards natural, organic ingredients, and I figured, Well, I've tried everything else; why not the natural stuff for my face?  And, man, I wish I'd tried it long before now.  This stuff is amazing.  My skin looks better than it has in YEARS.  No scary ingredients on the ingredient list; a very, very light scent; and a little dab will do ya.  That little bottle will last you a long time.  I use about a pea-sized amount to wash my face; a bit bigger if I've got makeup on.  It lathers up nicely in your hands so you can apply it to your face.  I'll be continuing to use this facial wash, and I plan on trying their moisturizer next time I place an Amazon order. Love it but very small! Smells great and no skin complications after using product. I purchased the facial soap, toner, and moisturizer and love all the products! Improvement with overall skin. High quality ingredients. Great product! Great product! Great product! I have very sensitive skin and this stuff is amazing! I have spent A LOT of money on countless products that did not work. This product is well worth the price and quality! I have sensitive skin and this face wash hasn't irritated my face at all! Plus I love the smell! I really do like this product but the new pkg dispenses too much soap and u can't tell when your running low. But I won't use any other facial wash. It works perfectly! I love it and I'll be sure to order another bottle soon. Me and my husband both have been using this face wash for over a month. At least twice a day. And have not used half of the bottle yet. Our skin is clean, he is very pleased with how much it has cleared up his face. When I wash my skin the new pimples that are trying to come to the surface disappear. I am in the process of figuring out which oil as a moisturizer, I like best. I have very sensitive skin so my almond oil broke me out a little bit, but it does not seem like the grape-seed is. I am so glad that this face wash works so well for my skin, or it would be a nightmare the moment :-) I don't know if they have other products, Because they have not tried to steer me towards them.Beauty tips that have been given are wonderful and work well. Lotion over my make up first, before washing works great ! The emails from Kenny to check on my satisfaction with the product have been appreciated. Lastly I know that the price is up their at $21 a bottle, but I can definitely tell you that you're not going to find another product of this Quality for this low of a cost. Also in my search for finding a new face wash I have spent more and not been satisfied with other products. So thank you to Christina Moss Naturals Organic Facial Wash for awesome ingredients and not selling out. Oh, I am 40 with the skin of a teenager :-) I love this wash. You need a very small amount to make a lot of lather. It goes on smooth and feels so refreshing!!!!

This facial wash is the best product.  After using this cleanser my face feels  so clean and soft like baby skin. I finally found the excellent cleanser. Love it! 5 stars from me. after using and felt my face its so smooth though haven't seen much of the effects too i think have to order again Love this face wash.  So nice to have something that works so well and I don't have to worry about any bad ingredients.This cleaner leaves my face clean but not dried out. I was  little skeptical when it first showed up as the bottle is much smaller than I realized.  That said, I use VERY little each time as not much is needed and my skin feels great. I have been using this product almost a year.  Really good This is an awesome cleanser. I use it everyday, in the evenings with a washcloth to exfoliate and in the mornings with just my hands. My skin feels fresh and free after using! I'm really liking this cleanser so far. It smells lovely and is very gentle. I would recommend it! Also, the customer service is excellent. Very knowledgeable and caring. Amazing!! great product!!! Worked great!!!!

My skin feels soft and my acne started clearing up. this face wash is amazing! i've been using this for about a month and will continue to do so. best face wash thus far!! You only need a small amount as it lathers well, smells good. I am in love with this face wash. I look forward to washing my face even more so now because of this product. It doesn't dry or irritate. My face feels really clean. Organic, and it works wonderfully even on eye makeup! I love it! You only need a very small amount to clean your face and it's good to know it's without all those Chemicals! Love this face wash.  You only need a drop to lather your whole face! Omgsss.

I love the clean, not dry, feel after using this!!! This product has worked wonders on my skin! I LOVE it! I have tried many face washes over the years, and this is by far one of my favorites! I've only been using this product for a few weeks but I really like it.  My face doesn't feel dried out and it smells great! Great product! I would like to add to all the wonderful reviews with 2 things.1. I had started a face wash/toner/moisturizer routine that I got from target, Something inexpensive, and that helped immediately. But, after 2 months it seemed like I platoed in improvement and still had break outs just not as bad. Then I decided to try fancier stuff and this clears up everything! And it's not harsh but deff use a moisturizer. I no longer need a toner.  2ndly! One day I sortof got fabric paint all over my hands and through my clothes on my hip and leg (4yr old craft project and they didn't have a spot of paint on them!) So anyway, this fabric paint wasn't coming off easily and I scrubbed with 2 different soaps, gave up and went to wash my face. When I put this magic stuff on my fingers and rubbed to start making a lather the fabric paint came off. Completely! With very little scrubbing mostly rubbing :D. I also used it to rub off one of those temporary tattoos. Yay!I've just reviewed the moisturizer I use with this If anyone is interested. Love this facial wash!!  It's a small bottle but definitely worth the price.  I only use a drop to wash my face so this bottle will go a long way and its organic and natural. This is amazing face wash! I use it with my clarisonic and my skin no longer seems unbalanced and acne is minimized! This facial wash makes my skin soft and clean. Would buy again! Great facial wash. Natural ingredients and so far seems to be effective. Doesn't irritate my skin. I'll buy again. Excellent product as well as superb customer service.  Very very happy with my purchase and will continue to use it in my skin care regimen Awesome product! Last a good amount of time, good ingredients, and beyond effective... Highly recommend it!! This was a gift which reportedly is working well for the recipient The best facial wash I ever used. I would definitely buy it again. I started to use it 1 year after I gave birth to my 2nd son. Had been on Cetaphil for quite a long time, thought it was natural and good. Totally wrong there. The ingredient list tells all. Anyways, my skin was becoming very sensitive and dry. Not to mention the big pores that I didn't even dare to look at. Really wanted to try some natural stuff thus I got to know this. My skin felt a little dry after the first a couple of uses. Hence I just stopped it. Then I was contacted by the seller for any thoughts after use. I honestly told him what happened and he, not knowing what I had gone through, immediately got what I might have used before and told me it was the common syndrome after using Cetaphil for a while. Things would be much better after a few more uses. He has also kindly offered full refund in case I still didn't like it after more trials. I decided to give it a try and now my skin is much better. I also tried everything I can to improve my skin. But this cleanser just makes my face feel great after wash, not dry but clean enough. I take it everywhere I go. Very grateful. I really like this facial wash and a little goes a long way on my Clarisonic.  Smells really good too! My wife uses the facial wash and she is very satisfied with it and exceeds her expectations! she loves it very much The facial wash is fresh, clean and all natural......I lOVE IT I was spending hundreds of dollars on Eminence products and getting no results. I am a 30 year old mom of three and just could not seem to clear my acne. I opted to try this instead of Eminence several weeks ago, and am SO pleased! Every trace of eye makeup-GONE... every pore seems cleaner and free of debris... oil and sebum production has almost normalized...pustules are disappearing!! Finally my skin looks healthy! I wash with this product almost every night, unless I do not wear makeup, and most mornings, followed by spritzing rose water on my face then gently applying a drop or two of tea tree oil, and every once in awhile a couple drops of lavender, a favorite eye cream (please Christina Moss make one!!!!!) and voilà! Every other day I do a homemade mask of a blend of Moroccan Red Clay, mix of herbs (top secret ;)) four drops neem oil, two drops tea tree, one peppermint, some OSHA, and several more. I leave my mask on for 10-20 mins and any acne black heads or blemish dissipates. Maybe I should patent the mask ha!! Anyhow this is by far the best and most gentle product with awesome results. Great product! This bottle will last forever. Smells great and cleans my face well. I really like this facial wash! Overall good. Typical smell or natural shampoo or soap which I like. Love it I have been using this for a while. It cleans well and does not sting the eyes. My face feels very smooth after cleaning my face with it. Basically, my major facial problem has been improved a LOT! I love this face wash! It smells great, suds up nicely, removes my make-up easily, and best of all it doesn't leave my face feeling dry or tight. I've been using this twice daily for almost a month. I have (well, had!) fussy skin that easily becomes too dry or too oily. I've been following this up with witch hazel daily and a clay mask a couple times a week- I haven't needed to use moisturizer since I started this regimen. My skin feels ""normal"" for once! It's expensive for the size of the bottle, but a little goes a long way. This face wash is a delight to use. It takes very little to get a gentle, rich lather and it rinses off quickly. I like it, and the size fits in my medicine cabinet-not a big clunker.  My skin feels clean, but not stripped. Great product for the face. Always feel clean and refreshed after using it Pretty awesome product. And the price is pretty good. I've received so many complements on my skin since  started using the face wash. Not invasive to my skin.  You can tell the product is made by natural resources. My skin feels clean without the harsh chemicals. I love it. This facial wash is great, my face is so smooth and you only need a couple of drops for a sudsy face wash, will order again. I love using this with my Clarisonic. Is gentle, works great, and lasts a long time. It doesn't take much at all to get your face soft and clean! I have very sensitive skin, and this cleanser does not irritate my skin at all.  It leaves my skin shiny clean. best face wash I got I love this! As a senior citizen I'm always looking for anything that'll help retain moisture. This is it. Along with the moisturizer I hit the jackpot. This product is great for people with sensitive skin. This works pretty good, I don't have to use very much to work up a lather. Work great I got this for a friend with sensitive skin. She has nothing but praise for this product and highly recommended it. Great product, I love it because it's chemical free So gentle on my super sensitive skin.  Smells great, and easily washes off my mascara. This is an excellent product.  It cleans very well and leaves your face soft.  Doesn't take much to work up a good lather and smells like Bergamot. So nice to find an all natural cleanser that really cleanses and doesn't dry out your skin.  Looking forward to trying the moisturizer as well. I have extremely dry sensitive skin and have had nothing but wonderful results with this products.  Smells great too. Best cleanser I ever used hands down.  It's so mild that I can use twice a day which never happens and it really works. I've been using this product for about 6 months now. It's my absolute Holy Grail in my ""Goodbye Hormonal Acne"" mission. My skin has never been clearer!!! This thing literally saved my face. Not only does it help for acne, but it also makes the skin feel feathery light and smooth.  I recently also purchased the moisturizer to go with it, and I can't express how great they both work. No allergies, no stinging. Just pure goodness! This is my second packaging, and I'll certainly stick with it! Great face wash:) Very happy with this facial wash so far. A little goes a long way! I will continue to buy this for my sensitive skin. Thank you very much for making it possible to enjoy chemical-free quality products. We all appreciate what you do! LOVE - LOVE - LOVE this product. My face feels GREAT after using this, The natural rosemary is very refreshing, leaves my skin squeaky clean, but moisturized.  Yes, this bottle is 4 oz - (which is 1/2 cup) while that may not seem like a lot, let me tell you that I have been using this product twice a day since Mid-August and I still have over 2/3 of the bottle left. A little REALLY goes a long way.  At this price for 6 months worth of product that is Organic with 100 percent natural ingredients this is incredibly affordable. My skin is extremely sensitive and I have had no problems whatsoever while using this product.  I cannot say enough good things about this cleanser.  I also LOVE the seller - EXTREMELY good communications, organic products made in small batches by hand, earth friendly, and ethical business practices. A rare find indeed in this day and age.  Do your skin a favor and order this today!I also use the moisturizer and the serum - these 3 products together have worked wonders on my skin! I love this cleanser.  It suds up like soap and is gentle and effective. Feels good on my face and smells great Love this product! Will certainly be ordering other thing from this line. I'm one happy cuastomer! Love the smell and how great my face feels after using it. Already on my second bottle. I'm using it and i felt its a quality product A little goes a long way. Doesn't leave my skin dry at the end of my shower. Nice essential oil smell (Rosemary). I am writing a review for the moisturizer, face wash and primer.I have fair, sensitive, dry skin. I have used the Clinique Redness Solutions line for several years to help with redness. I have tried organic lines before and every time I did, the product would make me break out or wouldn't help reduce the redness in my skin. I also experienced consistent dryness. No matter how much of the Clinique lotion (or any lotion for that matter) I would still wake up with dry patches. I used Mac foundation and sometimes Bobby Brown foundation as well.I decided a long time ago that I wanted to move more toward an organic product line, but again, none that I tried worked for my high maintenance skin. I looked on Amazon (and even tried different products on Amazon) but none worked for me. One day when I thought I would give it one more shot, I found the Christina Moss line. I read through the reviews and they were all really positive so I decided to give it a try.I started with the lotion, then bought the toner and face wash as I knew my skin probably needed some time to adjust. The lotion arrived and I used it for about 3 days before adding the face wash and toner into my 2x a day routine. I LOVE all three products so much! The smell of the lotion does not bother me at all as it quickly disappears and smells like other organic products I have used in the past. It moisturizes very well, I have no more dry patches, it doesn't feel greasy and blends well right into my skin and causes NO breakouts or irritation. The toner takes away redness and tightens my skin with no drying whatsoever! The face wash is gentle and again, no drying occurs at all and no irritation.My skin is extremely sensitive so the fact that these work perfectly for me and only have good-for-you ingredients is almost a miracle! Thank you Christina Moss for such a quality product, that helps my skin in so many ways, that I can feel good about putting onto my face, knowing the ingredients are not yucky chemicals, but natural ingredients that are healthy all the way around. I HIGHLY recommend all of their products and I will continue to use them as long as they keep producing these great results! So far I have been using this line for about 3 months and have recommended it to several of my friends! The smell is amazing! Just a pea size amount will clean your face. Cleans without stripping. Very happy to have found this company and it's products. This organic wash is excellent!  It actually cleans my face without making it feel too dry.  And it's organic!! gently, effective, natural, and smells great! One of the best natural face washes you can find ! the face wash is gentle and leaves my skin feeling smooth and really nice!! great product. smells good. daughter using daily works fine. I use it every couple days.  I feel its better than soap. Love this product!  A little goes a long way. I've been using this product for about a year and have noticed a lot clearer skin! 1 bottle lasts 3-4 months Love this, I use it then use the moisturizer...perfect combo for my very sensitive skin I like how it takes so little to cleanse my face and it has a very nice scent. I'm glad to find something that is organic. Face appears more clear and doesn't break out as much! So my whole life I struggled with my skin and tried so many different things that only seemed to aggravate or make things worse. My skin doesn't get too much acne but do struggle with clogged/dirty pores, uneven skin texture, weird marks etc.. Worse thing was I'm Korean so many of my friends have naturally great skin. My boyfriend surprisingly told me about his face wash and told me to wash my face simply once or twice day (strictly just this face wash and no other skin product). I was skeptical at first but after 2 months my skin is really amazing (even tones and no clogged pores) and I haven't had a single pimple since! It might seem a bit pricey but trust me this face wash is true genius. Love this facial wash.  Skin feels clean after use. No funny smells.  I will buy this again. Love this face wash! Been looking for a good organic face wash and I found it. Very good, very concentrated. Love this Face Wash! My skin feels very fresh and clean and a little goes a long way.Thank you!MG Works very well to remove makeup, dirt and oil, but doesn't strip the natural oils from the skin. Not one blemish since purchasing two months ago. A little goes a long way!  Use w/ CM lotion and w/ Peak Vitamin C Serum and Peak sunscreen. Recommend entire line--and a little goes a very long way! Nice smell and quality. Small bottle but you only need a tiny amount to wash your face. Only a small amount is needed. My face feels clean and refreshed. Works great.  An excellent product that leaves your face feeling clean and refreshed. Best face wash. I have very sensitive skin and this is the only face wash I will use from now on. Thank You a little goes long way. doesnt hurt my eyes, removes my make up very well, and  my face feels clean afterwards My skin is super dry,after I use it my skin feels  fresh and not that dry. I love it! I really like this face wash. I was skeptical to move to an all natural wash after using EltaMD for a long time with good results; but when I got pregnant and read some studies about links between chemical exposure and miscarriage I knew all my chemical products needed to go.I have regular to somewhat oily skin and have had struggles with little pimples ever since puberty (WTH, I thought breakouts were just for young people?? I'm in my 30's!). To be clear, I don't have acne, just little poppable zits. My skin started breaking out even worse when I got pregnant with all those extra hormones. After using this for at least a month now, my skin is clearer than it has been for years. Even while pregnant! I really did not think a gentle, all natural wash could do that.A long time ago I was researching how to clear up my skin and I read something about how lots of the products we use actually end up irritating our skin and making the situation worse because they are so harsh. If that's true, I can see why this stuff works so well. It really is a gentle cleanser. If I forget to moisturize afterwards my skin doesn't feel like an itchy, shrinking mess. Which makes me think of another skin thing I read--if we totally strip our skin of all natural oil, our skin goes into hyperdrive to get the oils back, which leads to oily skin.So basically, I think this wash is cleansing and getting rid of all the daily grime (plus make-up) while still maintaining your skin's natural balance. That's my theory. Whatever the case, it works. One of the best products I've used on my skin in 20 years.Light rosemary scent (can be used by men or women). Nice full lather without using a lot of product. And no chemical exposure!!! Really nice gentle face wash, smells good and lasts a long time.  Very pleased. I love this cleanser.  I don't want to put a bunch of chemicals on my face.  Works great. Love this product!!! Makes my face feel so refreshing and I have very sensitive skin and I have had no problems! Love this facial wash.  A little goes a long way and my face feel great. I was in the hunt for a new face wash. I have used boscia purifying cleansing gel and l'occitane's Shea cleansing milk. Both have worked well for me but my biggest gripe was availability and dispensing method.  Both are only available on specialty stores or have a crazy expensive shipping cost to Hawaii online.  So I turned to the ever dependable Amazon for free shipping and reviews I can base my purchase on.Let's start with availability.  Amazon's free shipping can't be beat.  The seller easy returns and guarantee gave me a sense of safety that if I didn't like the product I can return it and get my money back.  Super fast shipping too!Now for ease of use, the bottle looks quite small,  easy push to dispense.  Easy peazy. My biggest gripe from the face washes I've used before is the bottle is still 1/5 full and the pumps don't work anymore.  So I just throw it out and waste so much product. I don't foresee this problem with this one.The face wash itself is a pretty thick liquid,  I kinda was surprised how small it was,  but it is so true that a little goes a loooooong way.  Squeeze out only a dime size per use,  maybe a nickel when I use my clarisonic. But it's pretty sudsy, has a nice mild scent to it (lavender maybe? ) it washes well, does not leave oily residue or strip my face bare, but left my face feeling clean.  I have also tried it with waterproof mascara and it did remove it. I also use it when I shave my legs, because it creates very thick suds. Works great!So I think I found myself a keeper.  Thank you again Amazon for helping a girl out and kudos to the seller for a great product.  5 stars and highly recommended. I will certainly purchase it again. Now I'm thinking of trying out their moisturizer.... (wink-wink) Really nice on sensitive skin, cleans without feeling dry.Highly recommend this This is my first time using a facial wash.  I love it and will continue.  KA Great skin feel afterwards. I see improvements in my skin. Love this stuff!!! I have less acne break outs also Love this stuff! Doesn't dry out my skin but helped clear my acne. Definitely will buy again:) I love this face wash. It doesn't really have a smell, it washes without over drying and is overall a great product. The earthy smell was a little different (rosemary) but I love the product! Very refreshing on my skin. Great stuff! Works on Men too and incredibly well!...just sayin ;) My wife has been using this product for several months and really likes it. LOVE IT! I have a lot of stuborn acne and I finally was able to get rid of most of it using a whole product line from Mary Kay that was pretty expensive. However after using their products that were made of lots of chemicals for about a year and a half, I found my face worse off. My acne was gone, but I still had a lot of blackheads, my skin was dry all the time (it would peel on really cold days) and my face produced a ton of oil to compensate for being stripped with chemicals. I wanted to find a simple product that would benefit my overall skin. I ran into this and got it because of all the reviews. I got it about three months ago and I love it! I bought it with the moisturizer. I bought a second bottle of both already. I'm a broke college student so I was a little disappointed when I saw how little the bottle was that I had spent $22 on. But one bottle lasted me about two and a half months using it two to three times a day. My face is looking so much better now. My face isn't being stripped every time I wash it so my oil and dryness problems have been fixed and with some exfoliating I have gotten rid of a ton of blackheads. I have noticed I do get a bit of acne, but I honestly don't mind. I'm 19 and I don't expect a mircle product to get rid of my hormones. My overall face looks incredible; I don't wear coverup most days just because my face looks so fresh and soft. I love this product because it nourishes my skin and doesn't JUST get rid of a symptom. Thanks Christina Moss! Wonderful. I bought this because I use the cream and love it. It is probably the best face wash I've ever used, and I've used my fair share. It cleans effectively without stripping the face. Most cleansers either strip you, or leave a filmy residue, but this one gets it just right.Also the ingredients are simple and straight forward without long chemical names.The most important results is that it helps my adault acne significantly, and it does not break me out, even though my skin is super sensitive. It seems to have a calming effect on my skin.The bottle is smaller than I expected, but it's really concentrated, and you only need a tiny bit. Just like the cream, it should last several months. I love this facial wash. My skin feels and looks great. I love this Facial Wash.  It makes my face look and feel so very nice.  I would highly recommend it. Awesome! I love how it feels on my skin. It's gentle and very refreshing. works well.  Second time to order.  Not harsh The only product that has worked other than proactiv! :)"
B007IVCKUM," Works great Arrived right on time. Feels good on my skin. I've tried them all--nothing works as good for me as Vivant's line!! The face wash arrived on time in a big box. The bottle itself was in a plastic zip lock bag. Nothing damaged or broken. The wash itself has a good lather so a pea sized can get the whole face and neck area. My face feels very clean after using. As for whether it clears and even out skin tone? Am not certain. I am using it along with my other skincare products. It worth a try🙂 It's  really effective but also really harsh to sensitive skin. If I don't use a really intense moisturizer, my skin dries out completely. It's still 5 stars because I have seen noticeable improvement of my acne and my SFs. Amazing !  This stuff has cleared my acne so well !  I started using it on my face my scar is faded quickly no more breakouts my skin looks clear again.  Great for body acne as well my back has cleared up completely !  Before I wasn't able to wear tank tops or bear my back but now I can. Love this product and I have used it now for a number of years.  Cleans skin yet does not strip it of your natural oils.Leaves skin smooth and soft and cleans off all your make up residue. I accidently purchased this kind instead of the wash with the beads and scrub and I absolutely love this one. I was having some issues with my face breaking out so I switched over to this brand that my friend recommeneded and I absolutely love it! Make sure to use the face lotion after you wash your face too for better results! It does not irritate my super sensitive, acne prone skin at all. I leave it on in the shower for about 2-3 minutes, and my skin is baby butt soft!*Pricing* - The price of this face wash has nearly doubled since I bought it back in October 2017! Looks like I will be looking for another mandelic acid face wash. I do like this but my skin responds better to the exfoliating bp cleanser. Worked well to clear up discoloration on neck and shoulders.  Will definitely order again. Absolutely love this product. struggled with acne for a while. used Ziana and tazorac nothing kept my face clear. A combo of my topical cream and this as my facial cleaner has visibly shown a clearer face for me. Even get compliments from my facial lady If you have never heard of Mandelic Acid, you are missing out! This soap is so nice on my skin. It's not drying at all, but has done wonders to clear up existing breakouts and prevents them from coming back. Since I've started using this wash--just bought my third bottle--my skin has consistently improved. Someone gave this product a low review because she was sent the wrong item. I hate when people do that! This is a great wash and that review doesn't reflect the opinion of someone who has used it. For the record, I've bought the other wash she was talking about and it's great too, just too harsh for daily use for me.I also use the Mandelic Acid toner. I used 3% at first and then switched to 9%. I didn't do as well on 9%--too drying for me. If you've tried everything to clear up your skin, give this product a shot. Yes, it's expensive, but so worth it. I'm super careful to use just a drop and that's all I need. It suds up nice. You can also use it as a shampoo, but I've never tried it that way. I LOVE THIS STUFF!I originally bought it at my local spa for quite a bit more. This has been one of the only products I've found to keep my complexion consistently clear and decrease oiliness.  I love it!!! I suffer from cystic acne. It's annoying and persistent at various times of the month and lingers.  If you suffer from cystic acne, you know the drill.I've been using this for about two months in the evening only.  I moisten my skin with warm water to open the pores and use the cleanser sparingly. It doesn't foam a lot so I just put a thorough layer on my skin and let it sit for a bit. Five minutes or less typically.  I use my Clarisonic and my skin feels clean. It is not drying. It does a great job cleaning because nothing comes up when I use a cotton round and toner.I am very pleased with this cleanser and it is the best solution for a cleanser thus far! I'm happy with this purchase. It's worth the price tag Can be very drying, so I need to use it ever other day. But love the results. Acne seems to disappear overnight! Omg I love this!!!! I even used it on my hair and it made my scalp feel so healthy. The smell is great.  I can't wait to try more from this beauty line I am extremely please!! I LOVE this stuff! It is the only thing that keeps my acne from flaring up! I love this cleanser. Gentle yet very effective. Really like this skin care product, it has cleared up my adult acne. Thank god something worked.  Used twice a week, BHA the other days. For the price you pay it is worth it. The face wash will last for several months (well depending on the amount that you use daily). When using this face wash you only need a small amount. Also, this wash is perfect to use with a cleansing device such as a Clarisonic. A little goes a long way. Love how it makes my skin feel. Has even cleared up some acne problems. Great product! great product Great stuff. This is my second bottle,  loved it so much I moved up to the larger size Very impressed with this product, had worked better than anything else to keep my skin and scalp clear. Very much in love with the product, i have recomended to my friends Great product! Just started using and can feel difference immediately. I will update after some time. Very nice face wash.  Not drying but does smooth and tighten the skin. ONLY product that works for my keratosis problem! Love! Honestly, this stuff has changed my life. I had suffered from horrible skin for 20 years. This stuff allows any problem area to lose redness in less than 24 hours. Its a wonderful prodcut and I recommend it to anyone who has skin issues Good product I am in love with this stuff. I've used 3 bottles of this and it works for my skin! This product has done wonders on my skin. I have combination skin and some blemishes I have been trying to get rid of. I heard about this product on another website and wanted to try. I have tried everything from Aveeno to Clinique and have not been able to find anything that won't over dry my skin or cause more breakouts. I also wanted to find something that would help even out my skin tone. This product not only evens out my skin, it also prevents future breakouts without over drying. I would definitely recommend this product! Excellent product. Only face wash I use. excellent face wash I purchased this product together with the exfoliating cleanser to try to treat my recalcitrant acne.  It works well in getting the oil deep down in my skin.  Beware this product can be very drying to the skin.  Start by using once a week to once a month.  It helps, but I have not found anything to totally clear my acne. I've used this for years and truly can't get enough of it! I do a lot of chemical peels and use glycolic acid religiously in my regiment, plus I live in Florida which is the official sun damage state, and this cleanser really does miracles for my skin. Mandelic acid has amazing properties for minimizing melanin production in the skin, plus it works as a soft daily peel to maintain the skin exactly how you want it. I also love this formula because it can be used through the hair, on the face, and on the body if I need to. Vivant Skin Care simply makes amazing products! This is my ultimate favorite from this line! the mandelic acid is a gentle acid  that is derived from almonds, and I am convinced it is a miracle! I first went on my hunt for mandelic acid after having a facial at a spa with it, on my seach and after reading many reviews I foud this product line and actually bought the 15% mandellic acid serum first. I started using it in my normal regime and was happy with the results since it was making my skin so clear and smooth like I had from the facial.The 3 in 1 wash is different from the serum... you can use it every day. The serum, I reccomend using once every 3-7 days just because it is higher concentration and you really shouldn't be putting that much of any acid on your face. The 3 in 1 wash is great though and will give you a fresh, smooth, clean complexion that will leave people complimenting your ""natually beautiful skin""... The first time I got this compliment I laughed because before this I had sensitive acne-prone skin. Where most medicated shampoos did not relieve scalp itch, this product did. It also is gentle on your hair. Will be ordering again. Packaged well. Received on time. Good price. It's not a cure, but it is the best wash I've found thus far for my ongoing fight with hormonal acne. Omg what a shock to find something that works for hyper-pigmentation, gentle exfoliation, acne bumps cure, and smooth skin . Wow! The key ingredient -mandelic acid !!❤️  I’ve been using glycolic and kojic acid which seemed to cause irritation and more hyper pigmentation . Everyone especially colored skin should absolutely try this !!! As someone with sensitive combination skin, I am VERY picky when it comes to facial products. I have used Jan Marini for over 10 years, but due to their price increases, have started to try out next products.I have only used this face wash 2x & I can already see a difference. My skin is visibly clearer, brighter & smoother. It's also softer, which is a bonus!I will definitely buy again. Follow the instructions - lather on with no water, let it sit for 2-3 minutes, then wash off thoroughly. I only use at night & use a full regimen: different AM/PM cleanser, salicylic acid toner, benzoyl peroxide 10%, AM glycolic mattifier, PM glycolic acid cream, AM/PM eye cream & AM moisturizer with SPF. Best product so far. If you are looking for a product that clean your face including every bit of makeup. This is for you. It does not dry your skin out like other products. Try it for acne especially if you are older. Wish I could show you my pictures before and after using the viva t skin care. Keep up the good quality work.Doris Struggled with acne for 10+ years, even 2 rounds of accutane. Then I found this face wash and it completely changed my life. I dare you to give it a try -- I hope it works as well for you as it does for me! Contrary to other ages here, I am 77 and love this product.  I do not have dry skin or acne pe se, if I don't take good care of my skin, I can get small break outs. Shouldn't it end by now?  I have larger pores from having oily skin thru my life. Helps my pores to not fill up as much.  People say I have beautiful skin.  When I have facials they say, ""if it works don't change it.""  keeps my skin from getting oily in the summer. I can't believe I am using this product as a senior. I've suffered with acne for as long as I can remember! I've been to my dermatologist for many years. The only thing that really cleared my skin was taking antibiotics. I didnt want to be on antibiotics for a long period of time so I stopped. I've been trying Acanya and Differin gel with a separate bleaching cream. This has not helped by any means. The bleaching cream does clear my dark spots.I ordered this 3 n 1 wash and the toner <3%> from Hautelook. It's been 3 days since I've received my order. My pimples that were visible are drying up.!  There are a few that are coming to the surface. So far so good. It's also very drying which is perfect for my extra oily skin. My face stays matte longer.I haven't used this on my back or scalp <severe dandruff> as of late. But I'll try to update.Demographics: Black, 27YO female, resides in Louisiana, combination, oily skin, and suffered with acne for 15 years. Vivant Skin Care has created a body wash and shampoo that has become a game changer. Thanks to the Mandelic 3-in-1 Wash, I can now take my long showers, during the fall and winter, and not worry about my skin. My hands, legs, feet, and yes, even my scalp, have never been softer. The 3-in-1 Wash helps to hydrate even the driest of skin. As a bonus, it also assists with acne prone skin; which I normally deal with once a month. ;)Since we are putting it all out there on the table, there are also times when I get ingrown hairs under my arms from shaving. At the ripe old age of 33, I have even found a few in my chin/neck area … talk about nightmare! BUT, no more! The antioxidant wash does crazy good things to your skin that honestly I don’t even know how to describe. Now, I am not a doctor or dermatologist but I know what I like. I am considering getting my sister a bottle when I place my next order. I don’t know a woman or man, for that matter, who would not want softer, smoother skin and the Vivant Skin Care Mandelic 3-in-1 Wash can help! This really works on rashes and I will never be without it now that I have discovered it. Also is exfoliating much more effectively that glycol acid I've used. Give my skin a very nice soft texture. I have always had problems with my skin and this soap has completely changed my skin! If you have any type of razor burn it will clear that up as well. It does cost quite a bit but you only use a tiny amount at a time and it's completely worth it."
B001ET76EY," Great buy BUENO Great great best deal ever. My favorite body wash Great product, we use it daily Just as expected wonderful product. Was running low and had to restock this stuff works great! good Hands down the best for removing makeup even waterproof mascara yet super gentle Good cleanser, haven't had problems with it. Great value. Keeps my face clean and refreshed daily! Very gentle. Perfect if you have acne prone skin. Not drying or greasy this is a super buy on the double pack. will never use another face wash again! I swear by this product! My dermatologist recommended that I use this because I have skin sensitivity to the Sun.  While the consistency feels somewhat like hair conditioner, I feel really clean after using it and have less skin irritation.  Love it.  I also use their sunscreen. Love that too! This is so gentle on our sensitive skin. My youngest has so many allergies and can’t use commercial soaps. Fortunately that isn’t the case for Cetaphil. This cleanser has been wonderful and we are so grateful to have a product like this to use. I love this wash. I can actually understand all of the products that make up this wash. I have many allergies, and sensitivities, and this product does not contain any of them. It really does clean the skin gently, but does not dry like soap. This is my new cleanser for my bath, and sink cleanser for hands and face. I've been using Cetaphil and its associated moisturizer since I was a teenager. No other product cleaned my oily skin without drying it horribly, and it took care of my acne and later it helps with Rosacea. One thing, put it on your dry skin, then remove with either tissues or a moist washcloth. If you start with your skin wet, it doesn't work as well. It takes oils off your skin like a miracle cure. Also, I keep a little in a container in my purse. Because its so easy (put on, wipe off with tissue) to use, I can freshen my skin anywhere. Been using Cetaphil for quite a few years. What I like about it, is that it is quite mild; yet cleans very well. I use it for face wash everyday while showering. Leaves my skin clean and gives that clean, tight ""feel"". I hope they never change the formula. Its the best! This has always been my favorite facial wash. It is very mild for your sensitive skin. You can even use this without using water.Simply lather it on to your face and wipe it off with clean towel. I think this is ideal to use for babies. I've always used Cetaphil since I was 7.It's been my go to Cleanser, sometimes makeup remover.It is gentle to ALL TYPES of skin.Highly recommended if you want a no fuss cleanser that does its job. My dermatologist recommended this product to me years ago and I have used it ever since. I wash my face with it in the morning and evening. It never irritates my skin and leaves my face feeling clean and soft. The large bottle lasts about 2 months. I have been using this facial cleanser for years. I love it and will likely never use anything else. It leaves my face clean and smooth. I don't break out when using this cleanser and it doesn't dry out my skin. I highly recommend it! Been using this product for years. Removes mascara with no eye irritation. good stuff Nothing beats this stuff when you have sensitive skin. Even if you don't! this melts away my make up at the end of the day with no hard rubbing. This wash is the only thing I will use on my face - is not drying and is nice and gentle. Price is half off what they charge at the store. Best skin cleanser I've ever used, hands down (and I've bought WAY MORE EXPENSIVE face cleansers).Definitely going to purchase again. Great stuff. Wish it didn't have parabens, but only thing that cleans my face without irritation or break outs. Works well on my son and me I use for mousterizer on face body and same my son has eczema. I had a small sample of the product & liked it.  A small amount goes a long way & it is very gentle for sensitive skin.  The sample lasted a very long time so this probably will as well. Recommended for me to use on my eye area.  Super gentle and effective.  Very happy. My dermatologist recommended this a few years ago. I've been using it since and love it. Love this product  I have been using it for years.I love the photo. Please use it anytime. Probably the best face wash I've used. It doesn't feel oily and it does it's job of making my face feel refreshed. For someone with fragrance sensitivity, this is the only facial wash that works. Gentle and effective cleanser for all skins types. My skin is sensitive. I've used this for years. This is the best price I've found. family recomended….Much bettr that the expensive items from name proucts you find inn departmet stores….and half the cost. I have been using this product for years.  It keeps my skin clean and clear.  Recommended by my dermatologist. Makes my skin feel so soft. I use it on my face and it makes it feels clean and not too dry. And it doesn't leave my skin feeling oily in any way. Great product, works very well ! Great cleanser, would recommend. Always use Cetaphil cleanser Great Price, Fast Shipping Works great with my sensitive skin! Used this today.  Love it. My everyday cleaner. Good skin cleanser Very good product Excellent Product Great product Great cleanser! Thanks! Great price! good item This item is exactly as described and pictured Absolutely love this for my sensitive skin. Removes make up and no scent. This is the big size and if you buy at target it's at least 15 plus for one so great deal for 2! keeps my skin clear without drying it out. And works well on my daughters face too who has really sensitive skin. We love it great stuff love this stuff Very good Been using for over 10 years. Love Love this.  Very gentle and good on my skin.  I love it.  Would recommend. Works great. The best cleanser I have tried! arrived in timely manner, as described love it! awesome works good Great for cleaning face & body. Very good cleanser for sensitive skin, does not irritate baby's skin. Love this product and great that I can buy two at a time I've been using this cleanser forever and find that it helps clear up my acne more than the harsh cleanser that I used to use. Works great on my sensitive skin I have extremely dry skin.  I have a water softener installed on my home and I still have to use coconut oil as a moisturizer.  This product cleanses without leaving me dry.  I don't use it everyday (due to the cost) but I use it every other day (I use Neutrogena on the days that I do not use this product).  I love it. Great for me and my 3 year old who both suffer from eczema. Bought for my wife who washes her hands frequently and needs a gentle cleanser to avoid the ""caustic-like"" reaction most soaps give her. good value in large 20 oz bottle and the multi-pak. I have eczema, and my dad is a dermatologist. I used to have bleeding and cracked hands.  My dad put Cetaphil Cleanser in our bathrooms. So now when I wash my hands, I use Cetaphil. In less than a month, my hands were normal.  I also suggest using Aveeno moisturizer after washing hands. I have been doing this for many years now. Use this product all the time and this is a good price. 100 Does not lather, but thats okay, that means it has no sulfates, which are bad for you. You will eventually get used to it, and its so good to your skin. I love how these are actually bigger than the ones from convenience stores, for a cheaper price! I use this everyday, both in the morning and evening. It has been great! Sensitive skin made worse by an allergic reaction to a bug bite drove me to look for this old standby. There are 2 bottles in this package, I have one in the shower and one for morning and nightly face wash. It doesn't foam like regular soap so I added some body soap for sensitive skin to use in the shower. I and my daughter use the other bottle in its pure form on our faces. This skin cleanser is incredibly soothing for dry, itchy skin and leaves your skin looking and feeling as if you have applied moisturizer. It is gentle enough to be used on your face without rinsing. I first used this product over thirty years ago at the suggestion of my child's pediatrician. My sensitive redhead would get rashes even from bathing in plain water. This product and UCERINE lotion were life savers back then. I'm so glad I looked to the past rather than apply prescription chemicals to my itchy skin. I suffer from perioral dermatitis which is difficult to manage. This has helped clear it up significantly. Great product, I have used this for over a decade.  Good price. Reliable non-soap cleanser that is safe for sensitive skin. Every now and then, I get tempted and try another productthat promises to be safe for my highly sensitive skin, but only Cetaphil never causes the skin on my face or hands to dry or cuticles to peel. silky smooth Exactly what I needed, could not find locally, and a great price!  Arrived quickly.  I'm happy. Professional dermatologist used this after a treatment in his office in 1997.  I've been a fan ever since. It honestly works great.  I struggled with bad acne up until my early 20's and tried just about every product under the sun.  I use this and Cerave lotion twice a day and my skin looks better than it ever has.  Simple, yet effective! A++++++++++ item.so good. Great for problem skin. The Cetaphil was recommended by my dermatolgist and I have super dry skin where it cracks and bleeds in the winter.  This leaves my hands feeling soft and moist without burning. Regular lotion burns my hands on the cracks. It's also great for baby dry skin. I just love this prodsuct.  I started using it 4 years ago after my dermatologist recommended  it.  I have dry, sensative skin so this works good for my skin type.  It cleans your skin and rinses off easily without leaving any residue.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  I don't use any other cleanser.  Before I started using Cetaphil, I was spending way too much for Olay, L""Oreal, Neutrogena and other cleansers, when all I needed was a simple product that gets the job  done.And also, buy it from Amazon.  I got 2 20oz. bottles for the price I used to pay for 1 16oz bottle at the drug store. Wonderful product for my face and body which is dry.  Recommended by my Dermatologist very  good ! I have used this product for years.  I have skin that is easily irritated and dried and love Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser.  I have tried the Wal-mart equivalent, and it is not the same at all.  I highly recommend. This is a quality product & was at a fair price. Not too thin or thick, just right. Using for years. Great for removing makeup and using as a bath soap for my mom's sensitive skin! I use this as a non toxic lice treatment when my kids bring those annoying things home from school.  (Google it.  It's ""a thing"") Great price for such a large amount of this stuff! I need to use it because I've become allergic to most soaps. Not allergic to this one! Have used this cleanser for years.  It was recommended by my dermatologist. I've used this for years and love, love, love it.  Not greasy.  I have skin that dries and flakes if I use soap.  I use it every day.  Does not dry your skin out like soap or foaming cleanser. The Cetaphi Gentle Cleanser is great for use by people of all ages! My 3 1/2 yr old granddaughters doctor recommended as she has dry skin. Within a few days my daughter & I noticed how much brighter her skin looked & it was soft to the touch. I pamper my skin & have used some very expensive products to keep it smooth and wrinkle free @ 63. I decided to try it. I absolutely love it! It's not greasey or oily. Cetaphil is what I have been using for many years with my severe hand eczema condition.  It is gentle and you  don't have to use water every time you need to wash your hands.  Doctor recommended. Excellent I can't even calculate how much money I've thrown away all these years on over-priced cosmetic products.This Cetaphil Cleanser is all I will ever need from now on. My face feels baby-soft, even before I put on Moisturizer!Highly Recommend! perfect. Perfect Great value because of the 20-oz. sizes This product is wonderful for people of all ages!  It is especially nice for use when camping since it can even be used without water. Excelente producto This is the only cleanser I have used for years. Will reorder! Great value compared to store Thank u! Great cleanser. My dermatologist recommended it and it works fantastic. the best! My favorite soap! I love this stuff. First time trying! Very gentle. I am always looking for saving on Cetaphil.  I love this brand so anyone that give me good savings I approve.  If the deals are here, I will be here forever. Gentle on my skin and my dermatologist  recommended  it. We love cetaphil. Everyone in my family uses it. Great product. Doesn't aggravate my sensitive skin. Amazing cleansers. Extremely gentle and not harsh at all. Great product by an excellent seller Great product for gentle cleansing of sensitive skin. Delivered as promised. good size for home and travel. Cetaphil is a great substitute for soap.  Less drying and cleans nicely.  I use it for everything including my face and my husband uses it to shave.  It's a great product! My Dermatologist recommended this product for my extra sensitive skin. I got tired of always having really dry skin after taking a shower. Areas of my face would start to peel and flake which was not attractive at all. I just dealt with it because what is the point of taking a shower if I don't use soap to get clean? Well, I found my way to a forum about people who stopped using soap and shampoo entirely for a year and talked about how great they felt (and smelled, oddly enough). I wasn't quite ready to just rinse under warm water yet so I decided to try out a recommendation from one of the posters about using Cetaphil instead of soap and shampoo.At first, I didn't like it because Cetaphil does not get sudsy like soap does. If it doesn't get sudsy, how is it supposed to clean, right? It's just a liquid that I rub all over me and then rinse off. However, I just kept using it because I did not want to go back to soap and I wasn't ready to ditch cleaning products altogether. A few days later, I was half-expecting to smell bad. I even had my girlfriend smell me to make sure I didn't stink. The paranoia went on for a couple weeks before I realized that Cetaphil does, in fact, work. And it works well.I have been using only Cetaphil for about two years now on my body and my hair. I will NEVER go back to soap and shampoo again. When I travel, I make sure I take a small bottle filled with Cetaphil. My skin no longer gets dry and flaky. In fact, my skin is very smooth; my girlfriend says my skin is ""buttery smooth."" After the good results I had seen with Cetaphil, my girlfriend is using Cetaphil as well. Always a winning product words Used it for years and love it. It causes no breakout, cleans gently and thoroughly. Its fragrance free. Thanks very good Love, Love Cetaphil.  Great product for very allergic people like me. Best skin care product available, hands down. Excellent! good Excelent for allergic skins.  My dermathologist suggest me to use it every day instead of regular soap in one allergenic part of the body.  It really gets better Great product. Just as I thought. Thank you. Great product for sensitive skin. Excellent quality product. I use often . Love this soap. Other soaps leave my skin too dry. This won't. The only thing I use on my face for the last 25 years I m 72 & every one ask if I am in my 50 love it Good Good price worth it's price. Great savings. my son has used this cleanser for year ad loves it. Gentle on your face but gives a great clean. Fantastic soap/cleanser.  Gentle and hypoallergenic.  Highly recommended. as expected Good deal! Better than soap for sensitive skin. wonderful product Arrived on time. Good for the price. I thought I was getting the face wash and not the body wash but that was my fault great! Great stuff. Use it all the time. Great gentle cleanser for sensitive skin conditions. Love it. This is what I use for my baby's bath. Does NOT dry out his skin (since he has eczema). It is gentle and foam free, which is what we need for babies! Good I love it and I would purchase it again. Great for my dry sensitive skin. perfect! These are so gentle. Love them. a classic.  a standard.  Love this little size. I'm now 60 but started using this product in my early 30's on the advice of a dermatologist I was working for. My skin is very dry and occasionally prone to break-outs, particularly if not cleansed thoroughly. In my younger days, i just slathered it on and wiped face clean with tissues. I've also used Cover Girl Lush Lash Mascara (never runs or causes raccoon eyes) for over 30 years. This Cetaphil cleans it off easily because it's a gel-based mascara. This Cetaphil doesn't work as well on waterproof mascaras. After menopause, I got pimples more than I ever had them as a teen. It was like being in menopause and adolescence at the same time. My skin became very sensitive to any new makeup, and I love makeup. Now, I wet my face, slather on Cetaphil, wash with my finger tips, and rinse. Then I repeat the whole process with a washcloth to get off every trace of makeup, rinse again, and follow with Cetaphil Cream at night and Lotion for day (although now I need special sunscreen from dermatologist as well). Works for me! Great price (2 cost about $10 less than drugstore). Fast, fast shipping with Prime. Great value, excellent product. My son and I have sensitive skin and this is the only product that works! It's a great product, very gentle. I like it a lot. My skin hasn't looked better than this in a long time. I have tired several products and even a dermatologist and nothing has worked... But, I havewthree Words for this product: It will work After years of trying several different face cleansers for my acne and dry face, my dermatologist suggested I try Cetaphil. My face has never been so clear, smooth, and moisturized! It is seriously the best product out there! I only use a dime sized amount every night to wash my face, which is all I need, so the product lasts for a really long time! There is seriously no need to use the strong, over-medicated cleansers out there. Cetaphil is the way to go! It has seriously made a huge impact on my life and my face rarely breaks out. This cleanser works great on all skin types, mine being sensitive it works great. It's the best of any tried! I have very sensitive skin and needed a gentle cleanser, this fits the bill.  It also has mostly healthy ingredients which has become very important to me recently. I use this every day, in return I have very few wrinkles.My skin is smooth an silky.  It's the best!! Best for complection! This cleanser is the ultimate for at-home sensitive skin care. Buying in bulk from amazon also saves bucks! Exactly as ordered, works great. I do like it slightly more than the generic for some reason. Nice I use this as a shampoo and conditioner.  This was recommended for my dry, flaky scalp.  I was so suprised to find out that I no longer need to use hair conditioner, which I have had to use my whole life having such long hair.  My hair feel wonderful and this saves me time in the shower. Use it all the time - good product for sensitive skin. Same as bar soap. Cetaphil should be used by all ages. Good price. I use it regularly. my husband loves it My skin has become sensitive to face care products and this was recommended to me by my dermatologist.  It is a wonderful cleanser and my skin is loving it. very gentle All time favorite! Love it especially for a morning routine :) I've always had issues with my skin either being too oily or too dry until I came across an article saying that you should use cleansers that are gentle and Ph balanced.  After spending too much money on other brands for these issues I took the articles advice and tried Cetaphil.  Not only does my skin feel VERY clean after using it, it does a good job of removing all of my makeup, cleared my breakouts and made my skin so much more balanced.  I do not even wear makeup any longer!!  It is the best skincare wash and most affordable as well. Gentle formula helps keep skin clean without drying it out or causing oiliness. So easy on your skin. Helps heal from cracking. Use it to wash our hands GOOD I've used Cetaphil for years and I love how my skin feels; it is so soft.  I have very sensitive skin and feels itchy when I use soap.This is so gentle and haven't found any other product that worked as well for me.  My dermatologist recommended Cetaphil so that is good enough for me. great product cetaphil is like the best lotion on planet earth.  enough said.  it sjust plain legit.  super good for sensitive skin Wash your face very clean, and there is no burden. Used several bottles of these cleanser, very good and like it very much. This product was recommended by our dermatologist. It works. Love it. I love the way this product gently cleans. I find I can even use it to remove eyeliner without tears. love it Worth buying Excellent product, delivered on time, very useful for my kids sensitive skin.

None of us have ever had a problem with breakouts or acne.  We also use it as a make-up remover. Nice product!

I love the quality of the product and it is exactly what I wanted.  Everyone should buy this it is worth the money Love it I use it on my face and love the gentleness of it. Have tried many of the multiple facial cleansers and this does a great job and was a great price! Good product I really like this product: it is not drying nor does it make my skin oily. I have sensitive skin and prefer products that are aroma free and this fits the bill. I have used it for years and have never had a break-out or skin irritation. I'm a loyal user. Though I live in New York City, it is often difficult to find the Gentle Skin product in my local drugstores so I order it from Amazon. The Gentle Cleanser has a very different consistancy and feel than the Normal Cetaphil Skin product. I am now using it with the Clarisonic MIa 2.  So far, so good. Cetaphil is also  recommended by a host of dermatologists who have nothing to gain financially by recommending it.  It's really great for sensitive and aging skin.  It's not sexy; it's expensive and I think it works just great! I recommended to everybody to buy it . It is one the best skin cleanser I have ever had good for my skin 真的不错，下次还会考虑购买在，谢谢了！Really good, the next will consider buying in, thank you! Relly good for my sensitive skin. does not neccessarily have to be rinsed off with water, non irritating, for very sensitive skin, use it sinceabout 8 years daily. after recommendation by my dermatologist Have used this cleanser for years... particularly when traveling & there is a chance that rinsing soap will be somewhat difficult. Works great! Great buy and this cleanser works good for me. I've dealt with hormonal acne for long enough on my jaw and chine area and this really cut down all the break outs. I've been using this for 3 months along with a face cream and my skin looks decent. Here's a recent pic to show progress, no filters or editing or anything, just my skin after washing. I'm glad that my dermatologist recommended it. z I like this cleaner it the most gentle on the market.This is the only one I use for my hole body as it doesn't dry me out. great My husband's dermatologist recommended this product for him and it's very hard to find in local stores so I""ve ordered a couple of bottles for him. If a person has not used this cleanser they are missing the best. I've used Cetaphil without water to clean my face for more than 20 years. My dermatologist recommended it when I had an outbreak of rosacea, and I've used it ever since. If you use it as I do, twice daily, you won't need extra moisturizers or anything else for your face. Ladies, it's also great as a shave cream for your legs, as you don't have to worry about rinsing any excess off. It makes your legs silky soft.I love it when a simple product does a great job and is reasonably priced. Can't beat it! Very good product。Emulsion texture, very gentle, I love it.

It cleanses without leaving the face feeling parched and itchy.  An old favorite. Love this face wash, If you have sensitive skin this will do the job and yes I would recommend this product"
B01N00YT3P," A really nice thick facial ""gel"" cleanser, which s exactly what I was looking for. I dislike those foaming cleansers that are becoming popular (where you pump out already created foam). I end up using those kinds repeatedly throughout one single washing. With this product, one little dollop and I'm good to go. It smells fruity floral - not exactly like a powdery rose as the Eriobotrya Japonica Extract (loquat fruit, btw) adds a fruity tone to it. Still a lovely scent. The scent doesn't stay on the skin after rinsing, so it isn't overpowering. My skin is soft and clean - exactly what it should be after cleansing. I do follow up with my favourite moisturizer, however, so I can't say whether this is drying or not.I have dry skin, and a skin condition (patches of extra dry skin that get red and severely itchy in low humidity), and this has not aggravated my skin at all. I am also allergic to certain things (including coconut oil, which seems to be in *everything* these days)... so I am glad that it does not contain any of my allergens!Good product! I am happy!"
B018H32LHQ," good for sensitive skin Love this product. Definitely will buy it again. Affordable and effective! Love the feeling after the scrub. I love this scrub, not to harsh great smell and rinses extremely clean Wonderful, top notch scrub!!!!! Love it So good! Been looking for a good exfoliating scrub. Made my face so soft. very nice product.Delivers what it says it will do.Very nice scent and not too abrasive. Works great. Amazing product!  Smoother, softer skin with just one use!  Best exfoliant I've found so far!! Great exfoliator This is the second time I have ordered the Revive. I love it. It really does clean your face, and after using your face feels soft. Will be ordering again I am sure. Love it and highly recommend as a once per week routine. Rub softly, it's quite abrasive but not too much. It leaves your face feeling like silk! I have only used it once, but my face felt very refreshed. The consistency is very nice with just the right amount of abrasive compound mixed in. Love this product.  Makes my skin feel soft after use and very clean.  It is gentle on the skin.  I recommend this product.  I use it 1-2 times per week.  Leave it on for 15 minutes or so before washing off. This feels amazing and after using it, looks like I polished my skin. I enjoy this very much & will keep using it. I think this jar will last months! I love this product. I used a small amount as a facial scrub every other day after cleansing my face. It leaves my skin soft, supple and free of dead skin cells. I did not experience any negative reaction whatsoever. I love this scrub.  It is a pretty coarse grain which I wanted.  Oh, I found an additional use for it.  My hair is thinning a bit on top so I rub some on for about 30 seconds before I shampoo.  It is kinda along the idea that men essentially exfoliate every time they shave.  Anyway, seems to be working a bit for me.  No guarantees for anyone else but thought I would pass that along.  It can't hurt to try it on your head! I really like it. Yes it wasn’t full to the brim but there was enough product for me. When it was delivered it was really cold and I used it right away and I loved it! I’m going to put it in the fridge befor I use it from now on. Didn’t make me break out or anything. I used it as a mask. This is a very nice face scrub.  It leaves my face feeling so smooth and refresh feeling.

Wonderful face scrub. My face feels fresh and clean afterwards. I have noticed that my face is less oily. I also feel refreshed and rejuvinated after each use. My face does not break out like it used to either. This stuff works great! I use this about twice a week. It has made my skin so soft and clear! I have to use a moisturizer after I wash with this scrub, but I expected as much. Love it! I've been using it for several weeks now and my skin has become quite clear!  I would most definitely recommend this! Love this product! My skin feels great, and it got rid of the irritation bumps I had on my forehead! Took only one use to see a difference.

Leaves my face smooth and clear. Loved this scrub!  It does not feel as harsh as other scrubs I've used and I got just a touch of honey scent.  Skin felt refreshed and wonderful! I was very pleased with this product. My skin is quite dry and not only did the product exfoliate, it also moisturized. It can be used as either an exfoliation scrub or a masque. This face scrub really feels nice. It has a hint of cocoa smell when you first apply. It has a nice amount of scrubby things in it so you really feel like it is exfoliating your skin. I leave on for a few minutes and it has a nice cooling effect. I would order this again I love this face scrub.  Makes my face feel super soft and doesn’t cause breakouts.  Will definitely buy again!! This micropaste is awesome. It removes dead skin and makes your face smooth and shiny. This stuff is amazing!  It’s just the right amount of exfoliating and moisturizer. My face felt incredible after the first use! I will be buying this again. I really really like this scrub!! I use it weekly and my skin feels refreshed So far I love this product. I used it before going for a makeup consultation and the makeup artist remarked about how great my skin looked. Nice scrub, is not too coarse, the smell is not overwhelming, it and it has a nice consistency. This product is great!! Love this productIt really helps to remove all rough areas on face Great face scrub. Not too rough or harsh on my skin, felt very smooth after use I love this product!  Makes my skin feel soft and it looks brighter after using it.  Would buy again. GOOD SCRUB ----MAKE FACE FELL SMOOTH- HAVE NOT USED AS A MASK YET makes my skin smooth Very nice product, not too harsh or drying.

I tried it two times already.., keaves my skin smooth and clean, love the texture of the scrub and smells nice too LOVE. I use it 3 times a week. Not too harsh but makes skin soft Leaves your face feeling very smooth and removes blackheads. I just used this last night, and OMG what a big difference! I love it! obsessed with the product, however i did expect it to come in some sort of official container with instructions or background about the company but THIS WORKS! skin so smooth after. all texture and dryness was gone. exactly like when i got real microderm. “The product is wonderful and the seller are too! Thank you very much! I'd like to suggest/ask something: we will buy more from you but we were wondering if you could make bigger packages? That way the product would last longer, because it is very good!! My skin is super sensitive and this product doesn't hurt it at all!"" This is already gone! I saw an instant improvement with my face, it was exfoliating, but wasn't rough on my face at all. I used it at least 3 times a week, and a little goes a long way.  It left my face feeling refreshed and bright! I will definitely be purchasing this again! one of the best face scrubs I've used; definitely glad I came across this and satisfied with the purchase. would highly recommend buying if you are needing a good exfoliant or mask. Leaves my face super smooth and my make up goes on so nice after using this. This is working well for me. It's a gentle and effective product I have enjoyed using this product. It has my skin visibly smoother and softer. This is definitely a product I will continue to purchase and use. So far I've only used this once. My skin was SO SMOOTH after using it to exfoliate. I haven't had any adverse reactions or breakouts from the product, which always scares me when I'm trying something new. It is a small jar, however I did not need much to get the desired effect. It spreads well, and isn't too rough for my sensitive skin. After only one application, my skin feels and looks smoother. I love it! As always a great product and will continue to purchase. Leaves skin feeling extremely soft and does not dry out the skin. Love all the products from Era Organics!!! Great product! This scrub leaves my face feeling so incredibly soft. I use it 2-3 times a week sometimes while in the shower because the vapor opens up the pores so using this is extra amazing. And before bed. I'm obsessed! This product works really well for my skin.  I use it once or twice a week as a gentle exfoliator on my face, neck, and chest and it leaves my skin bright and smooth! I have been using it for a month now and still have half of the jar left. I recommend adding to your skin care routine if your skin seems dull or if you have mild acne. I've used it twice now - noticed a difference after first time already.  My skin was dull and tired looking.  The improvement is remarkable.  My skin is glowing after only 2 uses.  Awesome product! It surprises me everytime how gritty feeling this scrub is. I am used to more gentle scrubs but it feels good. My skin is so soft and bright after each use. Very gentle on skin. Makes skin feel super soft. Absolutely love it! Jar comes fully packed with product so it will last you a while. Smells wonderful and feela amazing. Love this stuff, it works like a dream! I really like this scrub facial.  Works well, Remove the dirt. Clear your skin and leave your skin absolutely smooth.  I use it gentlyand almost everyday. Love this stuff, leaves my face real soft This scrub is fantastic. It leaves my skin feeling soft without the redness and blotches that typically accompany other scrubs I've used from the drug store.  Thanks for the great product! I love this, my skin is very sensitive and this exfoliating cream is gentle but does a good job. It's creamy and hydrating while still not feeling too heavy. Definitely have noticed a difference using this product.  I use about twice a week.  I have not used it as a mask but have used it as a scrub and it is heavenly.  My skin looked noticeably brighter after using this.  I have sensitive skin that gets dry during the winter months so this is definitely helpful as an exfoliator. Excellent product! I love the smell and it makes my skin feel amazing afterward. I will def buy this again and tell my friends/family This stuff is great makes my skin nice and soft and gives me a beautiful glow Love the texture and smell. Do not overscrub or use too frequently! It takes very little product, effort, and time so definitely worth the price. Amazing! Perfection! Can't live without! Makes my skin super soft, glowing, clear and supple. Love this stuff! “Clear pores & makes skin feel so soft. Love it!"" Love, love, love this scrub!  Will continue to purchase.  I'm 50 years old and it made my face so soft and clear. Don't be fooled by the fact that this stuff looks like St. Ives in a tiny tub- it is like St. Ives on steroids, lol. My skin had become dull and congested. I was looking for a microdermabrasion product when I saw this on Amazon. I was skeptical because it had soooooo many rave reviews, but I had a credit in my account so I figured I had nothing to lose. My skin looked better from the first use- the microdermabrasion granules are the perfect size and firmness to really get off that dead skin without feeling like you are scraping your face off. The other ingredients really soothe and brighten your skin. I love it as a scrub and a mask. Very impressed. I still think it is too expensive for the size of it, but I am very pleased with the results. I love it is great the skin looks smooth any time I used Highly recommended. Reasonably priced. I used it last night and my skin is extremely soft! Used as a face mask first and then exfoliated and rinsed.  I used to use manuka honey as a face mask but it is so expensive. This two in one is such a great product. plus you're supporting a small family business and not some big corporation. I really love this facial scrub. Good for exfoliation and makes my skin very soft without irritating it For years I've been looking for products to help me clean out my blackheads from nose but nothing went deep enough to clean them. But this one is the real deal. It leaves your face baby soft and squeaky clean. It's my second time using it and the results are amazing and my blackheads are long gone . I'm never going to stop using this product. Thank you so much to the creator . I have sensitive skin and this scrub is gentle and cleans all the dead stuff off my skin. I like it and recommend it. Love this exfoliator! Makes your skin feel brand new after use. I even noticed a reduction in breakouts the next day. Excellent product! I immediately noticed a difference in the clarity and texture of my skin. My face felt very fresh and clean just after the first use. I definitely recommend this product, and will be ordering more. AMAZING!! But l think is to expensive.l got 4oz,and l wish it was $16 and the 2oz  should be priced at $11.l am a seller myself.And lf you lower the price a little you might sale even more.l have sensitive skin,and this cleand my face so good without letting my face dray. Bought this for my boyfriend to use on his face. So far, he loves it. He said he will definitely buy it again. Excellent quality product I believe in this scrub! ! I love your products, my baby's skin is better with your relief cream! I really love it, and my baby does too. This makes my face feel flawless. The jar is quite small but a little bit goes a long way. Very happy! I really like this product! I wanted something to help remove some old skin discolorations I have - some spots on my back just look like old skin that needs a good scrub to remove it.  I haven't seen any improvements for that purpose but I haven't had it long.  However, I was quite SURPRISED at how well this is helping my eczema!!!!  Its really like a miracle for it!!!  Before using the produce the eczema breakout on my neck was very inflamed and itchy - IMMEDIATELY AFTER APPLYING my skin felt 100% better, stronger, and healed.  I really mean it!  I didn't get a free anything for my review if you are wondering.  Most scrubs irritate the eczema on my neck but this felt soo good....I didn't even leave it on for a while as directed and it still worked.  Also, I like this as a face wash. Not harsh or abrasive, makes my skin very soft! SO glad I got this, it's definitely my new go-to face scrub! Not so bad! I’d used  3 times already! This facial scrub is amazing! It's course enough to remove dead skin but the base feels like silk. I love using this scrub, my face feels so soft after one use. I'll definitely buy more when it's gone. I've been using this for 2weeks now and I feel the difference in my skin,usually the winter makes my skin very dry, but since I've been using this product feels great. I have rosacea under left eye. Ive been to a dermatologist several times and she put me on minocycline (an oral pill to combat the bateria causing the rosacea), sulphur face wash, and left me the task of finding the moisturizer. My rosacea did start to clear up after several months but I began to get breakouts. Proactive breaks me out as well as the mainstream wahes and creams. I've tried EVERYTHING in all combinations possible. I decided to try some new stuff as a last ditch effort so I ordered some new, not-so-mainstream products...After applying Prosacea cream for several days days, I have noticed a significant reduction in redness, swelling and texture that is associated with rosacea spots. It does dry out the area so use a decent moisturizer. I have been using The Mother of All Creams as my moisturizer and it's been terrific. It can be used on your face and body for a variety of skin conditions. I also purchased Phat 5.5 Rosacea Deep Cleanser face wash. All three products come from Amazon and in two weeks, I've seen better results than from dermatologist prescribed regimine. Use this trio and see quick results in combating rosacea! Good luck! another amazing product from e-ra organics! feels and smells great, I use this in the shower before my normal face wash to clear away dead skin before using a cleanser with vitamin c. love this company and their products :) Best stuff ever!! It has worked wonders for my acne and rosacea! Nice product. Skin felt smooth and silkily really good product Great product! FABULOUS! The best scrub I had! The scrub is excellent without being too harsh and keeps moisture in the skin after use. This scrub is just right Works great Works well. works well Good stuff I like it My face felt softer and smoother after I used it. It was also very refreshing. Lol well you really gotta laugh at some of the negative reviews. The scrub/mask is made up of natural ingredients with no fragrance added. So for people saying they don't like the smell, what did you really expect honey and crushed walnuts with oils to smell like? To me it literally smells like walnuts. Not pungent or gross just a natural smell really. Also, it is no where near the same as st Ives apricot scrub. This is a gentle exfoliant with no cleanser added just natural oils and honey for moisture. It says on the jar it's for dry skin types. Also I feel like I should add that st Ives is composed of sharp large chunks of apricot seed that can actually scrape and scar your pores and skin, where this product is not. my skin is already super soft and smooth after the first use. I purchased this product because my best friend has been using it and loves the results. Very nice Makes my skin feel so good! love it great product Deep cleaning I absolutely love this product! It leaves my skin feeling so smooth afterwards! It also has a nice smell and has helped tremendously with some acne spots on my face. My skin is beginning to look much brighter. I would definitely buy this product again. Loving this product. This face scrub is wonderful. It smells really good and feels great. Great scrub/ mask Would buy again.  Leaves my skin very smooth with a healthy glow. GREAT Great It doesn't have the greatest smell, but this stuff works amazing. I've been using it for the past week and my face is really smooth and less dry. I haven't been able to see the difference with my acne yet but my skin definitely been feeling better since I started using it. Works wonderfully. Perfect texture.  Not for sensitive skin. Leaves a skin very clean and smooth. I love this facial scrub. It makes my skin nice and smooth after using it. It was a perfect addition to my weekly routine. Really enjoying this product - scrub isn't too hard so that I feel like I can use it every day. Love the ingredients! Second time buying it, love it so much! my face feels so smooth after it, i love it I have always been a fan of microdermabrasion. In the past, I've purchased devices that had sponge attachments and they worked wonderfully. But anytime I've used microdermabrasion without a device, I never seemed to get the smooth, clean and clear skin results I wanted. However, I have not found that to be a problem with this product. I use it as suggested 2 or 3 times a week and I use it along my face and neck and I get the same wonderful results as I used to with a device. An added bonus is that this product can also be used a facial mask. This is a wonderful product. I have tried so many different exfoliating products and this is by far the best. It smells great and it's not harsh on my skin. Will definitely purchase again. Left my face feeling great and really helped to remove some of my black heads. Love this very much. Feels great. I bought more of this brand after this. Buy this This smells amazing and is super moisturizing! It is more of a mild exfoliator, not too harsh. Love it! I can feel it working right away, seems the Skin is a lot Smoother , overall This is the best exfoliator I've ever used! Immediately after use my skin has never felt softer. It also helps with the skin dryness I've been dealing with lately. Definitely worth every penny. Works well!!! SMOOTH AND CREAMY , YET HAS ENOUGH ABRASION TO EXFOLIATE  BUT NOT IRRITATE! This stuff is amazing!! I have oily, acne prone skin and it gently massages away the oil and dead cells on the surface. Leaves my skin looking and feeling clean and refreshed. All natural too with no parabens, sulfates, or pthalates. Highly recommend!!! Thick scrub. My skin feels fresh and rejuvenated. Excellent product. Quality ingredients. Love this scrub. It's easy to use and does an excellent job of removing dead skin. My skin feels smoother. Absolutely loved it. It Made my skin feel so soft and evened out my skin tone. I look forward to using it every time! I definitely recommend this product! Great product and company. Customer service is more than courteous and accommodating. Thank you. This scrub provides me with smooth beautiful skin. Love this product . Left my skin exfoliated and really smooth with no irritation. The tub will last a while too as you don't need to use much. Will purchase again. Love this product Works so well and my face is not dry and tight after using it. Absolutely love these products. Started with the moisturizer and decided to try this one out. Love how it makes my skin feel! I recommend it to all my friends. Great product for such a reasonable price everything lasts me months This facial scrub I use daily it has done wonders for my skin. I would cry if I ever couldn't buy it. Love this scrub, it is a light scrub if you use your hands to spread and clean. Use a cotton flat or wash cloth for more exfoliation. I've only used it once so far but it left my skin glowing and clean. Love it Best choice that I have ever made! I brought this because of my acne scars. I have to say that I started noticing the difference from my first week. I am on my second week so far and I have to say there is a major difference. I will definetly be buying more from this company!! I feel comfortable enough to not cover my acne scars with concealers!!!! I was very pleased with this product, just the right amount of granulation to provide a good cleansing effect without being too abrasive.  Good product, This scrub is outstanding and very helpful for my skin.  Love it. Makes my skin skin look great and smells nice. This is the best, I thur out all of my other scrubs. Tried it on my legs and their so soft now. I love this product. This stuff is amazing. Smells great and the beads exfoliate my skin so well. Will be buying another as soon as i run out! Having run the gamut of skin care products over the years, I was modestly hopeful when I found this facial scrub. However, when the product arrived and I used it for the first time, I became a committed customer and advocate. I am 60+ and have developed a thick skin of skepticism with the empty promises of so many other products with all of the disappointment to match. However, after just one use I noticed a profound difference in the texture of my skin. The product is exactly as advertised with the turbocharge of a ""wow"" factor. My skin felt so healthy and moisturized that I didn't even want to apply night cream after my shower. So, I didn't. I slept with just the clean and revived feeling I got from my first use and by morning, my face still felt great. I'm going on line right now to see what other products this company has to offer. It's the real deal, and 5 stars just isn't enough to define my satisfaction. The integrity of the ingredients - all organic - with the absolute satisfaction of its effectiveness is unsurpassed! I have oily skin and absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. It is going to be hard to notuse the exfoliator on the daily given my sensitive skin and all but I will manage. Love this face scrub! It's the best I have ever used, leaves my face brighter and smoother. Doesn't smell the best but definitely worth it for how well it works. Amazing stuff! Can't wait to use again! This leaves your skin looking and feeling great with just a few uses. I noticed results the next morning. Gentle and smells good and love the way my face feels after using. I'm in love with these all my acne and dark spots are almost gone. :) I just started using this as a mask 3 times a week. Love the smell of it and my face feels clean and soft until I do it the next time. I was looking for a facial scrub for my problem skin and ran across the e*raorganics. I have perioral and contact dermatitis, so I cannot use any products that contain chemicals. So far, this scrub works for me. It exfoliates well with no harsh ingredients and no overpowering scent. I am really glad that I found this one! Great product, leaves my skin feeling soft and fresh. love their products I works a lot better than I expected! I notice after the first week that my skin was more even toned, there were a lot less blackheads. I love love love it I really love the way this makes my skin feel! So happy I came across this product and decided to give it a chance. I think the price is reasonable too. Really impressed with the seller also. They've made a point to reach out and make sure everything was okay. I will definitely be purchasing again! Love it!! This stuff is the bee's knees! I love it so much already. I've had the chance to use it a few times now, more as the scrub version. Everytime i use it, it exfoliates without over doing it. It leave my skin feeling so soft and smooth everytime. I can feel the honey just soak into my skin. The next morning i wake up with soft glowy skin, i love it. I have been noticing a difference in the stubborn acne in my chin area. The swelling and irritation has gone down drastically. I've been suffering with my chin acne for months now and nothing else has worked for me until i tried this scrub. I will definitely be repurchasing and recommending to everyone. Love the amount if scrub. It makes my face feel so soft. I have very dry and sensitive skin and am constantly looking for organic products after the first use my skin felt refreshed and rejuvenated- I couldn't be happier and highly recommend this product Absolute amazing product! After using just one time my face is smoother and healthier looking! Best exfoliant I have used and it smells good too! Customer service with the company is top both! Will order again!

Thank you for such a great product Works well and skin feels smooth after wards. “I absolutely love this scrub. My face feels so smooth and clean after using this. I haven't had a chance to use it as a mask yet, but wouldn't doubt that I'd be happy with it. thank you for such a great product!"" I've used this twice already and I love it. It makes my skin feel so smooth. You can use this as a mask, but I haven't tried that yet. Great customer service! Great product! Maybe I'm imaging it but my skin seems to look better even after just a few uses. I would highly recommend to everyone, but especially for people with sensitive skin like myself!! Came in a small jar but you don't much each time. Can feel smoother skin after using this. 2-3 times a week, no need to try every day. Purchased this for my 14 y/o son who is having breaking out issues. Used it once thus far. Seems to be gentle enough. Absolutely love this product so far!! I had issues with really dry skin on my face and since using this product in conjunction with the lotion my face stays moisturized throughout the entire day! works as expected First night using it my face felt soft and all the blackheads and Whiteheads were literally gone. Must buy along with the complete moisturizer it’s a perfect combo. love this!! recommending to friends The first face scrub to make my face not feel like a desert afterwards. Love it! Will update later on effectiveness on blackheads. I love this stuff. My face feels so smooth and soft after using it. I use it once a week as a mask and a couple times per week as just an exfoliant. Liked the face scrub. It really gives a sensation of light and clean skin. I would recommend this product. After I used this product for the first time, I told my husband 'feel my face, feel my face!' and he was quite impressed.  A few days later, my husband asked me, 'do you think I could try that face scrub?'...now my husband is a GUY's GUY...all tools and hot rod fixer-upper so I just about died when he asked me if he could use it....I am still chuckling about it actually but told him his secret was safe with me.  Let's just say that now this is a family product and will definitely be purchasing it again...as I have very sensitive skin, I was very very gentle with the first application to be sure I wasn't over scrubbing and now it has been two weeks and have used it 5 times...great results every time.  I am quick to follow up with my face moisturizer as soon as I use this product and it feels like have a new face every time.  Thank you Era Organics! Love this scrub. Face feels great after every use! This scrub is great! It is gentle enough to not feel like you're scraping your face off yet scrubs well enough to get your dead skin off nicely! My only critique is that the container is rather small. However, you only need a small amount to do your entire face so I suppose it is alright. Face feels great after use! This stuff is as good as it claims to be; very moisturizing, and helps clear out the pores. Does well with sensitive skin too! Love, love love this facial scrub made my face feel refreashed and brand new! Really love this product! Nice scrub. Love this product Use it all the time.....great product.

I just had a WOW moment and couldn't wait to write this review to share my experience! This is a little jar of joy! I was happy to order this because I have been experiencing breakouts for the past few months and haven't found anything to stop it from reoccurring. When I first opened the jar the exfoliating texture was a little concerning for me because I have sensitive skin. The smell is really light and you can feel a soft smooth clear cream under the exfoliating ingredients. There are only a few all natural ingredients in this product so that's great! You can use this microdermabrasion cream as a scrub or a mask! A 2 in 1 facial cream! That makes me happy because it is one less item to buy (SAVINGS), 1 less item to store (SPACE) and 1 less step (TIME) in my facial routine. The direction says you would apply it to dry skin for 5-10 minutes if you want to use it as a mask. I wanted both so I dampened the mask after allowing it to sit on my face for the recommended 10 minutes while I was in the shower and used it as a scrub and rinsed. My sensitive skin was left feeling soft, smooth and clean after the first use. I did not put moisturizer on my face after I rinsed the scrub off right away because I wanted to see if my skin would become really dry and sore. An hour later my face felt so good I forgot I hadn't applied my moisturizer. I can't wait to see the results over the next few weeks. I can't find anything I do not like about this product expect the size. I wish the jar was larger :-) It is kind of hard to say how this works alone, because I am using it in combination with a clay mask, 10% glycolic cream, and vitamin c serum. I suffered from moderate to severe acne. Nothing worked, everything natural, everything prescribed...I was even going to a esthetician twice a month. Nothing helped. I finally got on accutane and now my skin is clear. I was on accutane when I was 15, but unfortunately in my now 30's I had to do it again. While my skin is clear, I still have to wear tons of makeup because of the severe hyper pigmentation that was left behind. I can say this cream is almost odorless, gentle, and a little goes a long way. I have noticed a big difference in my skin. My skin is smooth, pores have become smaller, oil control has improved, and the spots on my face are getting lighter. Works great, helps to lighten my face spots.  Been using it for over a year Love this, about to reorder a larger one. I just brough this face scrub and i ALREADY ️️love IT , it really leaves your skin feeling smooth and clean. I ️love the fact that its cruelty free And that it has alot OF natural ingredients👍 My face is softer and smoother than it has ever been.  I have eczema and have a hard time finding ANYTHING that will help reduce my blackheads but not dry me out really bad.  This stuff is wonderful. If i could give this 10 Stars I would! This is by far one of the best skin products I've used, and I've used A LOT. I've suffered from acne for about 12 years now, and not only has this helped diminish my acne, but it's helped with my acne marks too. My complexion has become a lot more even since I started using this, and it's only been 2 weeks. I am a paying costumer who happened to stumble upon this product. I am not paid to write this. I do urge everyone to buy this it's absolutely incredible! Love this product! It leaves your skin very smooth and does not dry your skin out. Will definitely purchase this product again an check out their other products. I LOOOOOOOVE THIS!!!! IT IS A TOP EXFOLIATE!!!! Natural feel to the touch and the way it sets on the skin. My face has improved only ONE day of use and I can tell the difference. I am keeping this one for long! Great for an exfoliator a few times a week! My new favorite scrub!!! Good things come in small sizes!!  Will for sure buy again. amazing product I really love this scrub.  It leaves my face so soft.  I also use the moisturizer and facial wash and love them too. I LOVE THIS FACIAL SCRUB AND NEED TO BUY MORE SOON! It is the only scrub that truly clears up my skin. I have very sensitive skin and this works and feels great! I haven't been using it long enough to notice a big difference in my complexion but my skins seems to be clearing up! I have PCOS.. so I break out with cystic acne often :( But this product has changed that!!! I swear by this scrub. Try it, you won't regret it It is a great scrub as well as mask.  The mask made my face feel smooth! Love it . Love this stuff! I will be buying more.... nice exfoliation. Leaves my skin feeling silky and smooth, love! I have combination skin that gets super greasy during summer and super dry during the winter. I believe oilyness/dryness cause my pores to be clogged a lot. So I decided to look for a scrub to seriously dig some dirt out those stubborn pores. I have tried other face scrubs before such as Neutrogena pink grapefruit scrub, not a fan, felt so harsh on my skin! After I got this scrub, so far I have been using it twice a week and I'm a fan. It really feels like it's getting rid of the unnecessary stuff on my face and it feels soooooooo smooth and clean after (not dry!) I even use it on my lips sometimes since it's all natural ingredients. When I first opened I was afraid the scrub went bad because of the sour scent but it's all good and I have been recommending to my other friends! Great face wash! I've only used it a couple times, but so far so good! Leaves my face feeling soft and clean :) Very happy with this product. I've used it as a face mask and it left my skin feeling smooth and calmed down my redness due to acne. Excited to try more of their products! I use this twice sometimes three times a week. I feel like my skin is getting a spa day in the most healthiest ways. Love this! When I was in my teens, I had some horrible acne. I'm not talking one or two pimples, I'm talking about my entire face filler with big, ugly pimples. Due to this, I managed to try every cleanser, mask, pills, etc. out there that claim to help. Some did, some didn't. I am in my 20s now, and I wish I had found this earlier. I still break out, although not as bad as my teen years, and this helps me clear pimples. I haven't been using this for a long period of time, but I do plan to buy one monthly and continue to use as long as I can. I have scars and dark spots, and I'm really hoping this will improve them with time.I use it as a mask and then exfoliate with it. My face feels soft afterwards, but unlike the other exfoliators, this one doesn't dry my face, and I can feel the softness for a longer time. Give it a try for a couple of days. I didn't see results at first, but after a couple of uses, my face is really clear. I have even gotten compliments! When you have suffered with acne for half your life, hearing some say ""your face looks really clean"" is the best compliment you can get!I just wish it was a little bigger. So I rarely write a review but I felt I needed to after the first use! I love how this stuff makes my face feel afterwards!Pros:1. Skin feels light and soft2. My face actually feels clean and not so oily3. I can't stop touching my face!!Cons:1. Sensitive skin!! I left it on for about 3 minutes and when I rinsed it off my face and neck were really red. Not sure if that was from the product, using too much or rubbing it in my skin too hard trying to get as much dead skin off as possible; however, right after I used the moisturizer revive and it started to feel so much better! The red went away pretty quick. I applied a generous amount (basically did a little bit to make sure I wasn't going to break out from that, then after a few minutes applied more all over -- it feels so soft now!!)2. The bottle is smaller then I expectedOverall, this is the first face scrub/mask I have used and loved fell in love after first use! Also love the revive for after scrub! My gave doesn't feel tight, oily or dry. It actually feels moisturizer and clean. Highly recommend!!! So far, so good. I have really sensitive skin and this is mild on it, but works very well. Love this! Feels great as a scrub or a mask. Works great for oily skin. Saw improvement after first use. My dry skin has a new life!! Love this scrub. It has minimized pores, softened and smoothed. Smells like honey. With a healthy list of products, being from a small family run business, and being made in the USA it hit all of my preferred boxes- the added bonus was that the product is just absolutely amazing! I have very sensitive, dry skin with light rosacea on my cheeks. After traveling north for work, my dry face felt like it needed a good exfoliator but it's usually harder for me to find anything that works right away without further drying me out. It scrubs the face very well and hydrates your skin at the same time which I didn't think was possible. I'd purchase it again and am very pleased with the product. It does have a heavier grit and a slight smell of honey that quickly goes away. Can't wait to try their other products. Love your products! Thumbs up! Works great.  I love the way my skin looks afterwards. Amazing I have only used this once but my face feels amazing!! Great face scrub! This was my first purchase from this brand and I was not disappointed. My skin feels brand new after each use. It's helped keep my skin glowing and free of bumps. Highly recommended, even for sensitive skin! It leaves my skin feeling fresh and smooth. It is not to abrasive and it has a lovely smell. I have used this product for two weeks now and already am noticing a huge difference. I have followed the instructions that recommend washing with it three times a week and love it. It makes my skin feel soft and clear up. I have not yet tried it as a mask as I wanted to give it a go just with the washes. I use it when I shower by applying and allowing to sit for around 2 minutes. By the time I wash it off, my skin feels wonderful. It doesn't hurt when rubbing on my face like some of these scrubs can. Also, it doesn't dry out my skin the way some others have. I will be continuing to use this product and am excited to try it as a mask! Just after one use, my face already feels a lot softer. Going to continue using it and see how well it keeps up. Love it already! I did a lot of research to find a more natural way to take care of my skin! I just started using it and I love  the way it makes my skin feel! I haven't been using it long .. but I love that it's all natural ... it's not as abrasive as you would think pieces of walnut shell would be.  I like the way it leaves my skin moist and hydrated.  I'll have to use it more to determine the overall effects .. but so far it's a very nice product. I love the company and what they stand for.  I am currently in the trial period to find out how well my skin reacts to the scrub/mask, and I haven't had an allergic reaction.  Everyone's skin is different, so what works for may not work for someone else, and vice versa.  It feels smooth, and smells nice...to me it's faint and very pleasant.  I've had terrible issues with combination skin, between oily and dry, after moving from ak to wa.My experience with this: my dry patches have been healing, and skin has been improving with the oiliness, which for me is a miracle (in a tub).  A little goes a long way, but it depends on how you use it, as well as how much you need to cover your face when applying it as a mask.  I find that when I'm using it as a scrub I need less.  I'm going to be exploring their other skin care products!  Again, fabulous company - very passionate about customer care and product quality! Good product. This is a great scrub and mask. The walnut bits are a good size so you can feel them scrubbing your face. Afterwards your face feels really clean and fresh. The best part I think is using it as a mask. Just leave it on for 5 minutes then wash it off like a scrub. Your skin feels really smooth and hydrated. I've bought several skincare items from this company. They use high quality ingredients. Really enjoy using This product and I've never received an item so quickly. Very satisfied. I love this product !!! Love this Pretty awesome! I have a dry, very sensitive Skin and I am kind of really picky to choose the right product for my skin. This one is so far the best product I have ever used for my skin. Best part you can use it as a scrub and as a face mask. No irritation, not itchy at all ! Best purchase I've made all month. This stuff is so perfect as it gently exfoliates and moisturizerizes my skin at the same time. It's helping get rid out and keep away my acne as my skin has cleared it legitimately one use. My pores are also smaller and my skin is so soft. I have crazy sensitive skin and this does not irritate it one bit nor dry it out. I'm so grateful to have finally found something that works. Pretty neutral scent.  Makes skin very smooth, like that you can use as a cleanser and a mask. Love love love it. I use it on dry skin which intensifies the scrub Excellent product!! Would buy again"
B00A0J088U," Very refreshing This is the best face wash ever, doesn't make me break out or leave me feeling like it stripped 5 layers of my skin off. Up until Amazon, I was only able to find this face wash in travel size, and that was just by fluke at our local grocery outlet. So far I have yet to find any major retailer in my area that carries this face wash, so naturally I was stoked to find it on amazon. The product came faster than expected and was full sized! This was great face wash.  Wash really deep into pores and you don't need to use a lot every time.  Does keep me oil free throughout the day.  I would recommend. I have been using this stuff for about a year before ordering it on amazon because the local stores stopped carrying it. This stuff works great for oily skin, I haven't found anything better. If I consistently clean my face with this, it pretty much guarantees no break outs. As soon as I skip a cleaning I can expect something to pop up, so it definitely works. I noticed that long term use also improves overall complexion and reduces pore inflammation. This face wash works best for me. Feels very clean and oil free after using I love this product, everything I've ever tried doesn't work as good as this. My skin is very sensitive and it doesn't irritate it at all. I just wish i could buy a case of it at a good price. Instead of getting 2 or 3 every couple months Why these were discontinued in stores baffles me.  Best foaming face wash ever.  Axe bring tbis back out! This is very good face wash. I was skeptical as to if/how it could reduce the oily feel of my face; but it scrubs nicely and leaves my face feeling non-oily, but not dry or overly dry/chapped. First day of use and it feels great. Best face wash around. I have used several men's face scrubs and this one is by far the best, and it smells good too. Cleans my face just like I like it 😉 Originally purchased for my husband now I'm hooked!  Gets rid of make up and leaves your skin very soft and not shiny. Good way to wake my up in morning. I love this product. It really has reduced my skin from being so oily by at least 80%. Great to control oily skin without drying Great product inexpensvie and quick I have oily skin and have tried variety of facial cleanser including more expensive ones (neutrogena, kiehl, clean and clear).So far, this was what I was looking for.  It pulls out oils from my face and keep it clean, which suits my purpose.  I always use moisturizer afterwards so that my skin stays not too dry.  I would strongly recommend this product for men with oily skin.  Good price and does the job. Hubby loves this face wash, I guess it makes him feel manly :) he loves the cooling sensation. This Axe Face scrub makes my face feel nice.! AND it has a beast smell , so the ladies can be touching AND smell my smooth face. C; helps me with my oily face Perfect Product I like it  .  it can makes my face dry in a whole day . 100% recommended. make you feel absolutely fresh when you aren't. I loved the product. Long lasting and very effective too. good product I like the sent. It leaves my face feeling clean. i ordered this for myself just to try it out and it worked good for me. i know everyone is different but i would recommend this to friends and family I bought this because Amazon ran out of Neutrogena's invigorating scrub. Looking elsewhere, I found this for even cheaper, and in a bigger size. This stuff is great! It does exactly what it says, it made my skin smoother than ever, and my acne has gotten much better (even though its not really acne treatment). This stuff won't dry out your face like other products do. There isn't too much of a scent to it, which I like, and it's been lasting quite a while. A this rate it may last me a total of 2 months, which is great considering the benefits and its low price. I highly recommend it. Love this stuff! This is just the best aftershave. I have relatively sensitive skin. I have tried many different shaving creams/oils, many different aftershaves. This is the only one that kills the bumps. The scent is light, the cooling sensation is fantastic even if your razor is a bit older and you probably should have changed it but it's too late now. Not rough on your face like body wash is. Face is left moisturized, clean, and has a nice cooling effect. Bottle is a bit pricey, but works well for the price! Great scrub! Works to get dirt off the face and smells nice. It also leaves you clean without dryness or sticky feeling! I am buying more! Beats st.ives and has a clean manly scent whichIs not too strong! I tried all four of the Axe Facial Washes for men including the Axe Cooling Face Wash, Chilled, 5 Ounce which was nice, the Axe Oily Skin Face Scrub, Controil, 5 Ounce(their sp error) which did what it was supposed to but I'm a little unused to efoliating products and found it a little harsh. I then  tried the Axe Energizing Face Wash, Boost, 5 Ounce which I liked quite well , but then I finally I tried THIS one, the AXE Foaming Face Wash, Shield 4.2 ounce.  Sometimes it's good to try an entire line.  From just looking at them I would not have guessed that the foaming face wash would be my favorite but there ya go! It is simple to use in the shower and that may be what won me over.  I don't have to pick up a tube, open it up and squeeze out product.  The dispenser can sit securely on my in-shower shelf and I just dispense what I need.  I then foam it up, work it into my face and especially my beard, leaving it on while I shampoo my hair and do everything else.  I rinse it out before rinsing my hair conditioner. I find that this product, used in that manner, helps soften my beard better for a closer shave.  Like all Axe products, it has a scent but a mild one that fades very quickly.I'm not a really fussy guy about my appearance and Axe's earlier image of being for guys who go to clubs to hit on women never sat well with me.  It seems now that they've gotten away from that and are making things for your average career guy who just wants to up his game a little and look more put together.  I now use a couple of their hair products regularly and the Foaming Face Wash is  getting added to my list of preferred grooming items.  If I had to pick one thing about it I liked better than the convenience and beard softening effect it would be that my face didn't feel tight afterwards like it does with some soaps and body washes nor did it feel greasy and slimy like when I tried my wife's Olay Total Effects Body Wash Deep Penetrating Moisture, 8.40 Ounce (Pack of 2) and stupidly washed my face with it as well. Now THAT was a mistake of epic proportions!  I'm gonna stick with the Axe Foaming wash now.  it's a very simple routine and costs a lot less than the department store mens products my wife has bought for me in the past.Axe Foaming Face wash is a good inexpensive product that I will continue to use. This does not have a lemon scent. I like lemon scents, and I always think when I see yellow it'll be lemon, this isn't. It does have a very nice manly scent and it isn't bad, it just isn't lemon. So if you think it is lemon because it is dyed yellow, it isn't.It does however seem to clean very very well. I've tried a few different brands recently and I like this one the best. I have very oily skin and it cleans it very well.Additionally it has little exfoliating bits in it. Many face washes claim to have the little beads, but often there aren't enough, or they aren't abrasive enough, or they settle to the bottom of the bottle and they never come out. This bottle is designed to dispense from the bottom, so the latter problem is not encountered. Additionally it has plenty of beads and they're quite abrasive.All told, I think I'll buy it again, though I do wish for a lemon scent, I find it refreshing. This is a good facial cleanser that leaves your face feeling like you just wiped it with a nice menthol or very subtle witch hazel. There is no witch hazel in this, but it leaves the feeling that is somewhere in between the two.These Axe products also all have a very nice invigorating scent that is often too musty, too generic or too obvious in other men's line products.I've since restocked this product but only wished that it came in a larger size, like a 10 or 12 ounce container. 5 ounces? Honestly, that's a bit ""girly"" LOL. Women are typically more conservative with the use of their product and not wasteful. Men on the other hand, are more prone to blast out a big gob of this stuff in our hands and accidentally wash our whole body with it first. This stuff needs to upsized. I got this for my husband, he always picks it up at the store but never actually buys it for himself. He really liked it and it smells nice to me and him. I think after using this, if he ran out he would actually buy this himself now! It cleans well and has a nice pleasant masculine fragrance. Did not dry his skin out either. Axe makes surprisingly good products. Ok first of all this is actually a great product that would get rid of acne. I been having acne break out for as long as I can remember. I used so many face wash out in the market and they don't really work as it is advertised. One thing that I loved about this product it that there is no salicylic acid!!! When I use face wash with salicylic acid, I tend to break out more. In a plus side to this is that it removes the oil in my face and with the beads it makes my face pretty smooth. The wash is not really rough that it can damage your skin but not too soft that it won't the job. Also don't be alarmed that this tube is kind of small, you don't really need to put that much on, about a size of a dime would do perfectly fine. I can't stop saying how much I love this product, I would definitely get more when I run out. (I did not buy this from Amazon, I bought it at a store near my house,  it was cheaper than the one online). My husband has very sensitive, dry skin that reacts to almost every face wash he's used except for Aveeno Calming Cleanser. Although the Aveeno doesn't irritate his skin, he says it doesn't feel like his skin is properly cleansed after using it. I was hoping that maybe this Axe Foaming Cleanser would be worth a shot since it's made for senitive skin. He's given nothing but positive feedback since he started using it. The pump works easily and is super convienent. He loves the scent of this cleanser and it doesn't irritate his skin or leave it feeling dry. He says his skin feels throughly cleaned and he would prefer to use this instead of the Aveeno. This product is a winner! I gave this to my 15 year-old son, who is obsessed with all things Axe, and who has a mild acne problem.  He uses it daily in the shower, and loves it.  He says it makes his skin feel clean and controls the acne, but that it also makes his skin feel soft.I notice that when he does use it his face look clean and oil-free.  And I REALLY notice that it isn't nasty and over-stinky like some Axe products.One note: His acne problem is fairly mild.  I can't speak to how it would work on severe acne.BOTTOM LINE: Feels good, controls oil, leaves skin soft and clean, not too stinky. It really does the job for oily skin as well as exfoliates more effiently than the slew of other products that I've encountered throughout the years. I'm not fond of AXE products, but surprisingly, this product really works. Axe Cooling Face Wash facial scrub is a great product for us guys. All you have to do is rinse your face, apply face wash, massage in gently and rinse (be careful not to get the soap in your eyes).  After rinsing you'll not only get a great cooling sensation but you'll smell nice as well.  You will have to fend off the ladies at work when you use it.  I am really digging Axe's products and this facial wash is no exception.  If you want a long lasting cooling facial wash then you'll definitely need to get a tube of Axe Cooling Face Wash today. This stuff smells great and works in well. Has a nice and pleasant manly scent that is not to strong over overpowering (I am highly sensitive to chemical smells and things and for some reason I seem to be immune to AXE and that's something for the plus column) - I also have pretty sensitive skin and I have no quirks about this product at all.Pros:Rich LatherSmells NiceLeaves Skin Feeling RevivedThe Female AttentionCons:None - Duh!? :P Excellent product and very eye pleasing. Axe new line is great the ingredients in their new face products are surpringly good like cucumber, grape seed, and jojoba. My face is very clean after using the chilled face wash and has a slite menthol feeling but not over powering at all. The smell is fresh and all there new face products smell very good. Also I have the shield shave gel and is very pleased excellent ingredents and great shave gel. I will keep bying there new line of face products. Using this face wash early in the morning does a lot to clear out the cobwebs and put me in the mood for activity as opposed to sitting with my coffee and often drowsing off again.  I do appreciate this product.  I know there've been complaints about the scent of earliet Axe products, but I find this one healthfully masculine and not overpowering.  Makes one glad to be a guy. I'm so glad I found this product. I I bought another one for my brother. It well worth the price ! I picked up this AXE Foaming Face Wash for my teenage son because he won't wash his face with a cleanser because he doesn't see the need to (Ugh), so when he saw that this was an AXE product (He's a fan of All AXE Products) he took the bait. I could immediately see the difference in his face and haven't noticed any outbreaks since and now he always has a request for more of the AXE Foaming Face Wash.The foaming wash helps removes dirt and oil and gives your face a natural glow. I love how this makes my son look and I'm sure that you will enjoy the benefits of AXE Foaming Face Wash. I love this product and the majority of Axe products as a matter of fact. This specific face wash has a mint ingredient that produces fresh mint sent and cooling sensations on my face. It doesn't try my skin either (Cetaphil face wash actually dries it). The cost is reasonable and after feeling is clean and refreshing. Highly recommended. I used the scrub to slough off dead skin after shaving or waxing to avoid in grown hairs. I had the teen in my house try it on their face for two weeks. I saw some improvement, however, that person has cystic acne so realistically I didn't expect the Axe Oily Face scrub to do miracles. I wish we could find this product still in the stores!!! It works very well on my skin so I keep ordering! Both my son and my husband love Axe and all their products. It keeps them smelling good which is always important. They both loved the face scrub and both found it cleaned well without any harsh reactions. A+ Very happy with this product. This face wash had a lot of foam and large bubbles, I felt that my skin was very clean afterwards. The cooling effect left a tingling feeling on my skin that felt refreshing. This is an upgrade to my current face wash and the fragrances wasn't too strong either. I have used this for the past 30 days and prefer the scent and that this Foaming Face Wash has. Either you like Axe products or you don't, but this is worth checking out. I have noticed a visible difference in how clean and clear my face is. This is nice stuff. It is mild and gives a nice ""cooling"" sensation without it being too harsh. It washes clean and lathers up nicely. I am pleased and it does what it is supposed to do. Not much else to say about face wash ... What man wants to use face wash? This one! It has a great smell, texture and cooling sensation as you would expect from Axe. It foams up well and is not too strong on my sensitive skin. Good scent, good feel, good amount. Face feels clean and fresh after usage. What more can you ask?"
B004HK2I5E," I love this foaming cleanser!  The packaging is right up my alley as it is in my favorite color (green) and it's a top down which ensure your product is ready to use due to the gravity of the situation.  This green tea cleanser is a part of my nightly routine because of how well it works with my regimen.  I appreciate that this product is gentle on my skin, yet gets the job done.  Note that I have sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin and wear makeup just about every day.This foam cleanser also is in the top of the class because you don't need much at all to get foaming action out of this product.  When applying the cleanser simply wet your face and hands before hand then spread the product on your face in small and gentle circular motions. To remove the product I recommend using those same circular motions as you are rinsing the product off as well with warm water.  You can apply this cleanser with either your fingers or a brush.  My experience has shown that this product worked well with a silicone bristle brush and a traditional facial brush.I love this foam cleanser and will be purchasing again.  The product is amazing, but in the time that I have had it, it has come undone at the sealed end. So I have had to take extra measures to ensure that this product isn't compromised due to the packaging defect.I would recommend this to my friends, and I do on Snapchat all of the time. This face wash lathers very well and it makes my face feel super clean and refreshed! I've been using this since high school, which was years and years ago. I recently stumbled upon this on Amazon and I'm glad that I did. You will feel super clean and fresh after you use this! I was pleasantly surprised by this face wash. If you have oily skin it is PERFECT because it helps keep the oil down. Keep in mind though if you tend to be a little oily/dry it can make your skin feel a little too dry afterward, so make sure to moisturize after. I use this the most when I need to use an oil based makeup remover for tougher to remove makeup. It's good for double cleansing. Very good smell. ""Good"" means not strong, a little green tea feel, a little jasmine feel... and all of my friends like it.I agree with another buyer's review about ""the cap doesn't close tightly"", this needs to be improved.Will buy again. Highly recommend this! I have little bumps on my face, and now they are gone and my complexion has never looked better! this wash feels great, leaves your face clean, but not striped. smells wonderful! Favorite foaming face wash ever. Very soothing scent and leaves face feeling fresh and clean. Great-soothing for my sensitive skin. I received samples of First Green Tea cleansing foam and was impressed with how thorough it cleans, leaving my face fresh and smooth. Very little product is required for foam to develop.  I remove makeup first, then splash water on my face. I squeeze a small amount of cream (about 1/4 of the size of a dime) into moistened hands and pat on face to develop foam. I use Clarisonic cleaner to distribute foam on face, under chin and down neck. Rinse off with water. I do this routine twice a day. Product has a very pleasant fragrance, is not drying nor does it feel tight after washing. I am nearly 64 and have a fairly good complexion. I have extremely oily skin and it's very hard to find something that will leave my skin feeling fresh without causing it to become more oily over time ! This is my 5th tube!! I love the way how this feels on my skin! I use it in the mornings. It's not too tough on my skin and honestly my skin feels really good after. I have bad reactions to other cleansers, but this one does well on my skin! I will buy in the future! It took a little while to arrive, but the product is amazing! It smells like Elizabeth Arlen's ""Green Tea"" perfume, foams very well, so I use only a tiny amount, rub it between my palms with a little bit of water and use the foam all over my face. The skin feels clean and tight right after, so don't forget to use the moisturizer. Gives veryclean feeling. Love this cleanser. Make my skin smooth. I will buy this again. Thank you. MAKE YOUR SKIN LOOK AND FEEL AMAZING! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!!!!! Very good. I love it!!! LOVE this product!! i have combination skin and this really leaves my skin squeaky clean without over drying it. i use a toner and apply a moisturizer after and my skin feels clean and refreshed all day. i use it morning and night, even my husband has noticed the difference in my skin; its glowing!. i highly recommend this product! After washing face with the green tea natural facial cleaning, I feel like cleaner and especially less irritation. THE BEST"

It is exactly what I am looking for. very good soap I just love this stuff.......I have this and matching moisturizer, and it's just awesome! I've struggled with Acne my whole life......But, between using my Murad, and alternating with this, my skin has never felt and looked better !!!!! Ty ! I use this every morning and night does what it say my face feels more smooth to the touch which is good oh and I am a male  so yes this products says alot coming from me cuz I am very picky Love this. Cleans extremely well. I wear Dermablend makeup & that can be hard to remove but this does the trick. The little beads do not scratch my skin at all like other products. I love these cleansers! Use them every day, I hardly ever break out. Not sure they really wake me up or calm me down.... But, they smell great and get my face clean so, I'm happy! I am a 56 year old man that takes pride in my personal hygiene. I was introduced to this product by my 17 year old daughter. I t leaves my skin feeling so clean and refreshed. I recommend this product to anyone that washes there face ! the morning one feels great, you can actually feel your face freshing, and smells so good. The night one is ordinary and does not have that feeling of freshment on your face. I absolutely love these products! They have really cleaned my skin up and I keep one in my shower and it has helped get rid of the little bumps on my arms. Nothing to complain about it, I love Clean&Clear facial cleansers. Does the job, foaming, does not dry your skin and great scent.Also great price. I love, love the night time cleanser. I had never used before, smells great. Face feels clean and not overly dry wth both these products I have been a long time user of Clean and Clear! I love having the pack for day and night, it's so convenient. Great product! Clean and Clear is the only brand that works for my super oily face. If you have dry skin this might not be for you. Both cleansers smell of citrus and work well. Always like their products because they are good and economic Bought this for my son - he loves the daytime one and says it helps him wake up in the morning. I've tried it too and love the the clean fresh scent. We have not tried the evening one yet. Happy with our purchase. Got this for my daughter She uses other. Clean and Clear and she liked this one alot.Great product. Love this stuff and it smells amazing. I keep having to tell my husband not to use it on his hands! Great The morning burst has this minty feel and leaves the face feeling refreshed while the night one leaves a soothing feel. All in all they are pretty good This is great for acne if you get breakouts on your back or you want make completely off. Great price for a product that I've been using for years... Significantly cheaper than what's available in stores near me. This product was purchased primarily because it is not readily available in local stores.  The one-time offer of free shipping made this purchase more desirable.The Clean & Clear blue bottle is the better choice for normal skin (non-oily, non-dry) because the other Clean & Clear products that are available in local stores  (orange or other colored bottles) are designed for different skin types and may dry out your facial skin or leave your skin with an oily feeling.  The blue bottle is targeted for Oily, Normal and Dry Skin types and doesn't target just one skin type.Although I use this product sparingly and for when I work under strenuous workloads, the Clean & Clear Facial Cleanser helps keep my face feeling refreshed and invigorated, more so than ordinary soap and water might.The cleanser beads, according to the Clean & Clear product website, are designed to break down during cleansing that release the oxygen-infused formula for a cleaner and more healthy feeling.I just know that the Clean & Clear Morning Burst Detoxifying Facial Cleanser with Oxygen-Infused Formula, 8 oz. Pump Bottle does what it is designed to, well.That makes it worth considering and purchasing this product for your normal facial skin. my son says this is the best product to keep his skin clear. he is 15 and so far its working great I have always purchased this product at large retail stores. First time buying it online because it is way cheaper with the double pack. UNFORTUNATELY, I received the package with both pumps broken; nothing too drastic.As for the actual product, the morning burst is my favorite! It does wake you up. It is also great if you happen to sleep with your make-up here and there. Makes your skin feel brand new. I love this cleanser!  I have the nighttime deep cleansing one, and it calms me down after a long day.  This cleanser removes tough dirt and grime without leaving my face feeling squeaky!  This cleanser (the morning burst shine control) has a citrus-y, invigorating scent that gives me a little pep to start my day!  It also helps control my very oily face, and I love love love this cleanser! Great smell, cleans my face, not much more to it. Its a good face wash... Wakes me up in the morning and relaxes my at night. Face feels so clean The morning invigorates me and leaves a fresh feeling. The night smells nice and soothing. Both have helped clear up acne caused by coffee and an oily lotion that wrecked my face. Really good product.  All the beads explode when you put even the slightest bit of pressure on them. Works well to keep my face oil free and it helps with acne. Oh I love it to clean my face with this product, I am glad I found it! Awesome! Fast shipping with no issues as usual! Great product.  i use this every day and my face looks great. scents and feel after use are freshing and the price is good I bought this for daughter and I ended up using it!  Great products!  I especially like the night clean & clear.  Now I need a moisturizer. Bought this as a gift for my wife. She was very pleased. I used the ""night"" face wash in the morning.  Setting aside all philosophical questions about the irrelevance of time, I can honestly say these are both great products. Use after the gym, works well for oil. Love the feeling this leaves on my face at nice I love these and I will definitely buy them again! love love love love love love love clear face I love love love this stuff! The morning burst is my favorite of the two as it has a cooling sensation when you wash as the beads burst on your face. It has also cleared my acne tremendously :) Works great if you use it every day Love this will order more The product worked really well for me. I really like these face washes. Love it face feels fresh! worth it I love this product, have been using them for years Fantastic deal and awesome fast shipping!! Great cleanser! Defiantly takes the bumps and pimples away! I have always loved this product. Same price as going to the store without having to leave my house. It ships within a couple of days! Excellent They feel really refreshing on my face, if youre not a fan of tingling/or pore opening sensation then I dont recommend but for someone like the that likes that feeling I love this product on my skin, just if youre wondering I'm combo skin and it hasnt broke me out at all Yes! I first though it would be gone in no time. Was I wrong! All it takes is a tiny drop and you get this rich thick lather that really cleans your skin! Great product The only face wash I will use. My husband really likes the night time one. Clean & Clear has always been my choice of face wash, and I have to say this is and always will be my favorite pack! It keeps my face clean and I have no blemishes! I fell in love with clean n clear a few months ago and now i wont use any other brand. GOOD PRODUCT Great face cleanser Love the night / day difference.  I don't know if there's any real science to making one for night and day, but I like them both all the same. The first time I used this product I got the facial glow feeling, interesting to say the least.  Now I don't get it anymore. I guess my skin has gotten cynical about the whole glow effect. Smells good and seems to clean well. Just a little goes a long way. One pump is all I need. Good product to use in the morning and night to feel a bit refreshed and clean. It seems to help a bit with acne and smells nice too. If you don't like to go salon quality for your facial cleanser then this is a good, affordable cleanser for your skin. Definitely will keep your skin clean I love this stuff I use it every morning during my shower last a few months if doing half to 1 full pump . Highly recommend Love these, I use them everyday for acne and I have seen a big difference! I like it! I have heard ALOT and I mean a lot of negative reviews on this CLEAN & CLEAR but I love it ! I guess each person is different , I use it 2x a day morning and night , my skin feels great !!! My daughter loved this cleanser especially cause of the bursting beads inside of it. Very refreshing and skin looks very clean and clear when done just like the name! Everyone in my family uses this wash from me to my daughter and my sister I've been using a mix of this and cetaphil for the last several years.  It's a mild cleanser and it reacts well to my face.  I have moderately oily screen.  I haven't had any skin irritations or significant breakouts either. Good deal and good quality [[ASIN:B00JFV5X3E Clean & Clear Day/Night Cleanser 2-Pack i love them so much Works well. The day one had little pieces in it so if you are sensitive to texture change..... great i would buy this again it didn't give me any allergic reactions to break out in bumps The day dries my face a little, but the night is perfect and cools my face. The morning works because I put a light cream on my face, but if you just wash your face and go au' natural, this might dry you out a bit. Always love clean and clear products. I keep stocked up on this stuff - it does the job, as long as you're not looking for all that anti-aging stuff.  You can pay alot more for that if you want to, and I'm not sure any of it works. So far I have only used the nighttime with my Clarisonic and it seems to be working beautifully.  Very pleased that there is no sensitivity or rash from using this product.  I will update if any issues occur. Fantastic product, just wish it had instructions for opening the pump :-) Smells great and always leaves my dogs coat shiny! Works great but does dry your face out eventually Amazing face wash that keeps my face clean and clear, just like the name. Great product Morning and night versions together make this a great product!  The orange will wake you up in the morning and the nighttime scub helps to soothe you to sleep at night Will definitely order again. The night-time cleanser also functions as a makeup remover. Love it! The morning one sometimes dries out my skin (I have combination skin) but I just follow-up with a skin moisturizer. Awesome product and a steal deal. I use both regularly and faithfully. Makes your skin feel smooth in the morning and nighttime. Wakes you up perfectly and calms you down at nighttime. I love this product so much it works so well and it does take away the oils so well that you need a moisturizer but it's so amazing and I definitely recommend it Great buy it is quiet clean after wash face.with some small blue balls, it is interesting.anyway, it is good for oil face. My face feels super clean and refreshed after. Great at removing make up including mascara Both nozzles were broken but over all the shipping and product were great I have always been happy with clean and clear products and love this one, it just smells so clean and feels great. great price to buy 2 pk Very refreshing feeling. I will buy again. Great price. Face feels very clean and fresh. great deal, great product Love this it works well for my oily skin very good cleanser. i thing is not for every skin, but i can recommend it. very very clean a a Just as advertised This is my favorite face wash and I really like the morning and night option. Best product to keep  skin clear I like the way it is working in my face This product we're AMAZING, my skin felt soft and clean right after each use. My granddaughter loves washing her face with it these products have done wonders for my skin I love it. It feels great after applying. Good stuff, has kept my face spotless for over 2 weeks now Works wonders.  Would definitely recommend. It has been great in getting my face clean morning and night Very fast and feels amazing This is the best, inexpensive face wash I've ever used. Been using clean and clear products for years and if you haven't yet, it's wort a try. If you're one of those people jumping on the bandwagon against the evil micro beads, do some research. These are not plastic, and disintegrate after a little rubbing. I haven't seen any company use plastic beads since the idea first came out. Not saying they aren't out there, but these items here are in every picture attacking micro beads, and it just makes people who are against them look foolish. I'll continue to use this product as long as they are making it. Good price I was on the hunt for a low price but high quality face wash and I found it! These two cleansers have seriously changed my skin for the better. After a month of use my acne is almost completely gone! The Clean and Clear Morning Burst is hands down the best cleanser I have used in the drugstore for mornings. It does not dry out your skin and makes your face feel unmistakably clean. The orange beads in the cleanser make it remarkably refreshing. It makes me feel energized and ready to start my day! The Clean and Clear Night Relaxing face wash is also amazing!! It removes all my makeup (including waterproof mascara and waterproof eyeliner) and has an aroma that helps me wind down. And just like the other cleanser it does not dry out my face. I  was extremely impressed by these products and I promise you if you buy it you wont regret it. Awesome perfect amazing great This soap is great I've been using it for years and the seller was great they wrapped them well, we're have to have quantity and quality and great timing! And good price.  Would definitely recommend the product and seller I've had problems with oily skin for a very long time. I tried different facial products, they all would clean my face once I apply them on but by the end of day my skin would become oily again. I thought it had something to do with my hormones... Because no facial washers could help my problem. And now I tried this product and I must say I am amazed with results! After using this product every day for 3 weeks now I am happy to say that I have no more oily skin! No more tiredness either. That is amazing!!! I love everything about this product: It does not make my skin itchy, it helped me to get rid of oily skin, it is very refreshing and it smells fantastic! I would recommend it to everyone. This product is a change of pace from the usual facial cleansers. I love the feeling after rinsing the product, it opens your pores and allows a cool and refreshing breeze. All while keeping your face clear of acne. Great product and I will be purchasing again. The cleanser beads in the facial cleanser are nice compared to straight face wash.  I really like the abrasive feeling (though I've since moved on to apricot scrub, which is much more abrasive).  It smells nice and works well. What a nice product. I like this very much and wish I would have tried this a long time ago.  The Morning Burst is so refreshing without drying and it leaves my face feeling clean and fresh. The Night Relaxing cleanser is the perfect cleanser to remove makeup and wash away the days debris leaving my face feeling revived, clean and soft.  I have used other facial cleansers costing so much more money and from now on will be using Clean & Clear Morning Burst , Day/Night Pack. As usual Amazon delivered my package on time and packaged well for shipping. This makes my face actually feel clean every morning and helps me to wake up. This is my first time trying this product and I really like it and my face seems to have cleared up! I leave...and I always come right back.This has been the only face wash that works for me since I was a teenager. I never feel quite as clean as I do after I use these. The smell of the morning wash is invigorating, the night wash is relaxing.I want to say that they finally got rid of the microbeads in the day wash, as I could not see them on the list of ingredients, but I'm not 100% sure. They did appear to be dissolving.Combined with a konjac sponge, my face has never felt better. Love both of the face washes! They lather nicely and leave my skin feeling clean. Price is good and comparable to the local stores. Smell is light and non lingering. Product is not too harsh on sensitive skin. Will buy again! This was purchased as a sample size with a credit toward future Clean and Clear products.  As I order one of their products fairly regularly, this was an easy choice: The face wash seems to work well and does not irritate sensitive skin.  The travel size is helpful for overnights and/or plane trips.  Will probably purchase this product in its full size. Bought this on a whim for myself, I'm not usually into all this pretty boy stuff, but sometimes after a long day at work this item really helps to wash up my face and provide a little burst of cooling sensation.  Also works great in the morning to perk up my face. I love Morning Burst. It cleanses my skin and won't overdry it.This would be my first time using the Night One, and just like MB, it left my skin feeling clean and super soft.I'm 26 years old but my skin is still as oily and sensitive as always, so I can't use those harsh, adult-oriented cleansers.For some reason I'm no longer able to get C&C products at my location, so this combo is great for me, and it shipped quickly This product worked better than any other face wash I've used. After a week my skin is significantly clearer and feels healthier. Any pimples and blemishes I had cleared up a lot in a few days. It also feels so nice and refreshing. When I first started using it, it pulled my skin and it felt tight. I put on some moisturizing cream and it felt fine. Then my skin peeled a little. After about three days my skin was used to it and feels great. I would suggest this product and I will be buying it again when I run out of it. I've been using this face wash for about five years. I use the morning burst version both in the morning and at night - don't worry, it won't keep you awake at night. One of the best things about this face wash is that a single bottle of it lasts an incredibly long time, maybe 6-8 months, because you only need a tiny bit each time you use it. I don't notice the beads when I am using it, but the scent is very nice. This has been great for my skin. I kept breaking out and needed to make a change. My skin cleared up after I started using this. It didn't dry out my skin at all. I don't really understand why there is a separate one for morning and night, so I just put one in each of my 2 bathroons. I love this facial wash! It does get your face clean and clear! I have used this for about a week! I use one in the morning and the other at night! It has a real tingling feeling when you wash your face! That is a good thing because that's how you know your face is really clean! It has a really good smell and it doesn't dry your face like other washes do! The morning wash really wakes you up because of the wonderful smell! Try it you just might like it!! This product is for everyone who hates waking up, or is not a morning person.  When the cleanser hits your face your eyes start to open more and more and you have a very clean  face, but you don't want to stop the beads are fantastic. I love it.I saw the night item at a local kmart and it was the same price I payed for both of these here in amazon!Anyways, I feel like this is the perfect item to start my day, end my day and feel my face fresh and alive throughout my daily life.Even if it you aren't using this for acne treatment, it's a great product for washing your face throughly, and I'm happy! I love, love, love this stuff, it  definitely wakes me up and gives me a refreshing feeling. It cleans very good, the little blue dots break once they are in your face and release a ""detoxifying"" feeling. I use it both in the morning and at night before going to bed, since I wear makeup everyday to work, I wash my face at night but I noticed that only cleaning it with a makeup remover cream that I have and washing it with another facial cleanser, was not really cleaning my pores and that would make me break-out sometimes...so, to make the long story short, I started using this, plus the other products and my face is now break-out free and very cleanse. Definitely recommend this product. I've used this product for years and absolutely love it. It does a great job of giving me a clean feeling and the beads in it make it tingle just a bit after you let it soak on your face. Good product, great price. I was having a really hard time with acne and really oily skin. It's very frustrating because I'm 24! I didn't know what I was doing wrong.  I decided to try this and I LOVE it. I've been using both for 5 days and my acne has gotten an out 70-80% better. I am very happy and will continue to use this product.  I also love the morning burst it really does help me wake up in the morning. I've been using this face wash for a few years now. I used Clearasil face wash previously and that one always had a medicinal smell. These smell great and get the job done just as well as Clearasil. The Morning Burst face wash has a minty cool feeling and feels great on your face right after you wake up. The night face wash just feels smoother, nothing else to really say about that one. All in all, great products! Works really well and has kept my face nice and clean. The whole day/night thing is kinda bs, the day one doesn't make you feel any more awake and the night one doesn't make you any more tired. But they are both good and make you skin feel fresh. I have purchased/used Clean and Clear products for quite a long time. They work really awesome. In addition to the product, Amazon subscribe and save works awesome. Takes care of one item from your shopping list automatically. Both products are wonderful. We have used them for years and now that they come in a pump, it releases JUST the right amount every time.The morning burst exfoliates and gets you ready to face the day, while the nighttime formula washes away the dirt and grime leaving your skin refreshed and relaxed promoting a great night's sleep. Pros:- Makes my skin feel alive again- Morning burst really leaves you more awake- Night Wash makes my skin feel light- Both make my skin feel free of oils and sweat from work/sleepCons:- In my opinion, I would of loved to buy a much bigger size bottle.Other than that nothing really bothers me. I love these products. The micro-beads make me feel like my pores are getting the cleaning they really need. No greasy feel afterwards. I use a small face sponge, and a small pump lathers up amply, One bottle will tend to last me about 6 weeks-2 months used twice a day. I follow up with the Clean and Clear astringent and face feels ""clean"" and oil free. While I enjoy the products and have no fuss with removing make up. Both my bottles were busted rendering the pump shot! I have to unscrew the unit and wipe some off the straw of the pump to wash my face morning and night. IF it weren't for useless bottles I'd be happier. My friend says my face glows every night after I use it.  I'm not quite sure what it's doing but I know it washes off all the make up on my face and does not over dry it, leaving my face feeling refreshed!  I will sure recommend and buy again. I love this duo! Having something specifically for my face really helps my skin  clear and even out which was a total shock to me! I like the morning burst because after I dry my face it tingle from the beads moisture really love! This is the first time I've ever used this stuff and I'm impressed! After only two days of continuous use my face and head have never felt better! The blemishes and oil are going away and staying gone unlike that prescription extremely expensive crap! So fresh and so clean clean..... I am not a face wash person I've never used any. I don't have a issues with acne, usually, one here and there. But it's really cleared up my husbands face. He loves it. I love it. Perfect!!😍 I love this. My face is sensitive so I usually can't use a lot of facial cleansers and this works great for me. My pores have gotten smaller, my face is clearer and brighter and my acne has cleared up. The morning burst has a tingling sensation that does wake you up. After use my face feels and looks so clean. It also works great with a facial brush and the smell is wonderful. If you need a sensitive cleaner for mild acne and a basic clean I recommend this. I can't believe how quickly this worked on my skin. So smooth and soft! My go to cleanser! I honestly thought that the Day/Night thing was just for marketing. but its actually true - to an extent. The morning face wash makes my face feel cool and helps to open up my eyes - it's analogous to the feeling you get when you drink cold water after having a mint. My regular soap/body wash/other face washes I've used in the past never did that. It's especially useful during the weekdays when I have to wake up early for work and my eyes just don't want to open up. I don't feel anything with the night wash though - maybe its just me because I've always been a night owl so products like this don't do me any good in that regards. The smell for both of them is really nice and they don't leave my face as dry as my earlier face wash(es) did. All in all, a great purchase! I am a person who suffers with acne. I sometimes find my face drying out due to the stronger products I have to use on nearly a daily basis. I desperately needed something to use during those times that would not continue to dry me out, but would give me a thorough cleaning. This is it! It does not target acne, but does leave you feeling extremely clean and refreshed. I love it and will continue to use it. This is a great deal! I use them both on the same days and they don't dry me out all. I have combination skin (my forehead tends to be oily while the rest of my face is pretty normal) and it helps cut down on the oily parts while not drying out the normal parts.MORNING BURST: I love this! I usually have a hard time waking up in the morning, but this combined with cold water just really gives me a surge of energy that I need. Also, it leaves my skin nice and smooth, so it's all nice and ready for my makeup (somedays I don't even need a moisturizer because this has already done the job).NIGHT TIME: The lavender is divine. There is something so soothing about putting this on your face. It always seems to calm me down and help me unwind. I suggest leaving it on for a few minutes (like put this on and then put your conditioner or just chill for a few moments) because it really just helps your skin soak in the moisture and the scent is really relaxing. My mom took the Morning cleanser because she likes the exfoliating beads and she is pleased with it. I have bad acne and combination skin and I use the Night cleanser as just a regular cleanser. It's on the thicker side so it stays on your skin and foams up a lot. I use it with a rotating facial brush sometimes, so that thickness is nice. It's not drying at all and it really gets deep and does its job. You're not really saving any money with this bundle but hey, a little extra for no human contact is cool. ;) I have to say there are many face cleaners on the market and I have tried many. This one actually gets rid of the shine, feels good and smells great. If you have oily skin or just too shiny skin you should definitely try this out. The shipping was super fast also. I Love it. It is a great product. I used to buy it just for me but one day my husband run out of his forever facial cleanser and he had to use my clear and clear morning burst. he loves it since then. If you have skin that ""adapts"" to your facewash this pair really works well. Its been almost a week since I've gotten these and im almost cleared up. You have to be diligent though, orange for morning blue for night. Only con is that it does leave your face dry, but that's something I can live with. I'm  23.....ok 28 lol and sadly still have acne. I thought I'd  give these two cleansers a shot and was pleasantly surprised. My skin gets really oily no matter what  i do and this helps tame my grease face without drying it totally out!! Ive been using it a little over a month and sice then I've  only had a couple of rogue zits  pop up and a lot less blackheads. I'll be keeping this part of my skin care regimen  from now on!!"

I've tried many face washes & can confidently tell you this is the best face wash in the market now. Ursa Major has a great product for a good price. You only need like a teaspoon of the product on your face & it lathers a lot so one bottle will last a long time. Your skin after use does not feel tight nor greasy; It just feels clean & nice to the touch. I use it every day & does not dry up my skin. Ingredients are all natural--- nothing synthetic. They also have a face tonic that I recommend but is not required. This is the best face wash I've found, I'm totally hooked.  It leaves a very clean fresh feel with no residue left over.  It also doesn't dry out my skin.  After using this stuff on a daily basis I can't go back to anything else so the travel size is a must have for when I'm away from home and need a small size for the airport.Yes it's expensive but you need very little for each use which means the bottle lasts a LONG time.  You get what you pay for here, this is the best stuff out there. Great face wash, gentle and great with exfoliation. love it! Keeps my skin glowing and clear I have oily skin type, I like this almost all natural face wash.  It cleans well and it's gentle on my skin.  I like that it's almost all natural, a bit expensive but I went ahead and bought a second bottle when I was halfway done with the first so that must mean something.  It didn't perform miracles for my oily skin type but I think it's a very effective face wash and I will continue to use it. I subscribe to Birchbox and received a trial size of this face wash and I haven't looked back. As someone with oily skin, it's difficult to find something that helps alleviate the oil and not overdry my skin, but this wash does the trick. It leaves my face feeling clean and fresh and eliminates all the oil from my skin without overdrying. Can't get enough of it and will DEFINITELY order more! YES YES YES. A gentle and rich-feeling face wash that's comprised of natural and organic ingredients. It smells refreshingly herbal and earthy. And it really delivers results. Friends comment on how clear, smooth, and healthy my skin looks. After many years of trying a multitude of drug store and luxury brands, I've finally found a face wash I never want to give up. You won't be sorry! Saved my face from bad blemishes without hard irritation. Maintains a balanced skin pH that yields neutral oil production and comedone/white head/black head formation. Expensive but WORTH EVERY CENT! I have been using the same face wash for over 10 years because if something isn't broke don't fix it, right? Well, I got a free sample of Ursa Major from an ad I saw where I just had to pay shipping. The sample lasted a little over a week and got me hooked. It leaves my skin feeling so soft and clean and it smells really good. The best part is the fact there aren't any nasty chemicals in it like my old face wash. I thought it was a little pricey at first glance but I'm telling you it is SO worth it! I contemplated buying it for a while but inevitably broke down and bought it with overnight shipping because no other face wash even comes close to comparing after you've tried this. Hooked for life. Also, if you order from the company's website they will send you 3 free samples of their other products; however, you can't really beat amazon prime free shipping! I am a woman and use this face wash. My boyfriend and I share the face wash and it lasts us about a month. This face wash is fantastic; no harsh chemicals or drying and it really helps with blemishes and acne. My face is clear and glowing. Cleans and almost exfoliates but does not dry - good smell for guy or girl! I'm a 22 year old male, just for reference.I have a problem with buying any new face wash I see on the shelf. I've gone through just about every face wash you can think of. When I bought this face wash I was skeptical because of the price. To shorten things up, BUY IT. If you need come convincing, read on.My arsenal of face wash has gotten so big that it's grown out of the bathroom and I have a designated shelf in the closet. This face wash can replace all of those.- Value: Originally I thought this face wash was on the pricy side. I now realize that it's an amazing value. First off, there isn't a price on a clean face and clear skin. Second, a little actually does go a LONG way. The bottle has lasted me 10 months or so and I use it twice a day.- Cleansing Abilities: I've never felt such squeaky clean, while leaving my face moisturized still. I don't wear makeup so I can't say that it's great for removing makeup but it does leave my skin brighter and clean feeling. It uses natural fruit acids to gently exfoliate. (Which is such a plus considering micro-beads just end up on the bottom of our lakes and oceans and NEVER decompose.) This face wash produces a GREAT lather for me with just a small amount. When my boyfriend uses it, it doesn't lather as much as it does with me. I don't know if that's because he doesn't wash his face as vigorously or the same as me, but nonetheless he claims his face feels just as clean as mine.- Smell: It's a very natural scent. I think it's hard to explain. The best I can describe it is an earthy, citrus, tea tree type of smell. Not so much peppermint but it does have that cooling feeling on my face which is why I say tea tree.- Completion: I have pretty clear skin, with the occasional break out. After switching to Ursa Major, I haven't had a single break out. I do get the sporadic zit but I don't think that's avoidable. My skin seems more predictable, clearer, and overall smoother.I see some people ask if this product is just for men. I believe the company originally formatted the product for men but my mother, who's extremely picky about what she puts in and on her body, LOVES this stuff. She loves the smell just as much as I do. I don't think it has a gender and honestly gender specified products are just marketing BS.I recommend the Ursa Major 4-in-1 Essential FACE TONIC 8oz as well. I'd get it with the spray/spritz cap because it's great when you're in a rush in the morning or come home from a night out and can't be bothered to wash your face. Just a few sprays on your face and you'll feel cleaner and ready for bed. This isn't a necessity but very worth it. The Ursa Major Fortifying FACE BALM 2.5oz was very nice. I actually really liked it. But it's value wasn't enough for me. I ran out of it after a month.MOST IMPORTANT NOTE!!!!!!!!!On the companies website (UrsaMajorVt.com), you can purchase the Happy Camper Sample Set. It comes with the face wash, Ursa Major Essential FACE WIPES - 20 PACK,Ursa Major Fortifying FACE BALM 2.5oz, and Ursa Major Stellar SHAVE CREAM 5.3oz. If you sign up for their newsletter, they'll immediately email you a $5 credit towards their website. THE SAMPLE SET IS ONLY $4.95. So if you're on the fence I highly recommend doing this. It's what I did to get a taste and I ended purchasing every part of the set.Please if this review was of any help, please let me know by hitting ""helpful"". Got a sample of this from a FB ad and it was more than enough to try for a week. I love the scent, light yet noticeable without being overpowering. Foams up nicely with just a dime size amount and leaves my face feeling so refreshed, oil-free and not all dried out. I've noticed blackheads on my nose shrinking and haven't changed other products in my routine. You only have one face, spend a little and take care of it! I am 35 and never had too bad of acne until about 2 years ago.  In my college years I used proactiv but hadn't needed anything special since then and mostly bought my face products at the drugstore until about 4 years ago when I started getting more natural products.  Then suddenly at age 33 my face went crazy.  I had thousands of teeny bumps all over my face and some horrible pimples that never seemed to go away.  I was struggling for several months and in desperation decided to go back to proactiv since it had used it in college.  Proactiv helped but it didn't totally fix my acne problems.  I would still always have at least one pretty big pimple at any given time and some bumps lingered.  After a year of using proactiv I decided to stop because I thought if it's strong enough to bleach my pillowcases, towels, and clothing, why am I putting it on my face!  It even bleached my eyebrows and I had neon orange eyebrows for a while that I would have to color in every morning to look like a normal person.  When i stopped using it my face went crazy again and I had several months of trying every product out there--trying to find something more natural.  Again my face had thousands of teeny bumps and I was getting so that I didn't want to go out in public. I finally stumbled across Ursa Major and got the face wash, tonic, and balm and staring using the three products morning and night.  I immediately noticed an improvement so I kept using the products.  I have to say it took about 6 months for the complete transformation to occur but since it did I have had perfect skin.  I never had skin this good even in my twenties.  I think the last time my skin looked this good I must have been 10 years old.  It's never dry or too oily, all the bumps are gone and I never get pimples.  I have even stopped wearing face makeup except for concealer under my eyes--something I've never done before.  No face powder, blush, or bronzer because my skin looks so good.  I love the fact my skin is at its best with products that are gentle and safe.  I would highly recommend trying the products and not just for a week or two.  With me the progress was slow and steady and best of all permanent! This is the best face wash I’ve ever, ever used.  No lies!  My face feels clean, soft, younger, with smaller pores, smaller blackheads, etc. etc. just after ONE wash.  It’s kind of crazy.  Haven’t been using long term yet, but could not love this more.  Highly recommend and hope this company never stops making this.  No clue what’s in here but it’s magic.  BUY THIS NOW, you will not regret it.  No one pays me for this, bough this myself and this is my legit review, don’t get samples in this house.  Love this, hope you do too because yes finally!! I have sluggish yet sensitive skin. It has been difficult to find a cleanser that helps both those conditions at the same time. If it is too moisturizing it causes blocked pores. If it is too exfoliating it causes redness and irritation. I purchased this in the travel size on a whim. I am so glad I did. This is the best cleanser I have used for my skin. In a short time I have noticed my pores looking clearer and my skin texture looking smoother. No dryness or irritation at all.I leave the cleanser on my face for about 60 seconds and then rinse. I am really impressed by the difference this has made in such a short time. I will not hesitate to buy the larger size when I run out. A great skin care product IMHO. I discovered this face wash via Birchbox a couple years ago, and I absolutely fell in love. It lasts me quite a while, and it's never irritated my sensitive skin. I'd highly recommend it.It does have a strong scent, so if you're not a fan of cedar/outdoorsy scents, this might not be the face wash for you. i have moderately oily skin and am prone to breakouts. i am always nervous to try new face washes but my mom found this one for me to try. my skin has never been so clear. i go weeks without a breakout and get an occasional pimple here and there. my skin feels so clean and refreshed! Great face wash-- highly recommend. This takes off even my eye make up. I had a sample in an Itsy (or maybe Birch Box, I can't remember) bag and wanted to use it all the time. I hate having to pay $8 + for shipping and so I looked it up on Amazon and viola! I love Prime!! I can say without a doubt that this face wash cleared my skin. I used to have constant breakouts and every face wash that I tried left my skin dry and irritated. I've been using this for over a year and love it. I'm willing to give it five stars even if I really dislike the smell because it has been so effective on my skin. This face wash is AMAZING.  Each time I use it, I'm transported to a cabin in the wood surrounded by cedar trees.  The cedar and mint scents are so lovely - I wish I could get other products with the same scents.  (Also it keeps my face clean!) I* am not the type to buy expensive face wash, but a sample of this came in a subscription box and I* used after running out of my normal face wash. 100% would recommend. Not only did my face clear up but as soon as it ran out i* started breaking out again. Smells nice too. A little goes a long way I do not think there is a better face wash out on the market. Paraben free and all natural. Great for the skin fellas! I love this face wash. Smells good and doesn't dry out my face like many of the other cleansers out there. Before I switched to more ""natural"" face washes I was using all kinds of big name brand cleansers because I kept breaking out. This lasted for years. Dermatologist didn't help and I pretty much tried every kind of cleanser I could find in the store. I received a monthly subscription box service as a gift and received this as a sample. I tried it but didn't think it was going to work. after a week of using this, I noticed that my skin was much softer and wasn't dry at all,then the oily skin was gone because I didn't need to slather on tons of moisturizer to offset the dryness that the other cleansers would cause after washing and then, the zits went away. I've been using this almost a year now and I'm so happy I found it. It turns out that my skin just didn't like all the chemicals that are in many of the name brands out there. This really is fantastic face wash I have very sensitive skin that would flare up if the face wash is too intense. This face wash goes very easy on the skin, and I've had no problems so far. I love the smell and it has just the right amount of exfoliation. Furthermore, just a tiny squeeze from the bottle can wash the entire face, so it'll last quite a while. This Face wash is absolutely the best that I have ever bought.  Worth every penny!"
B0081E6X1W," I use this product in the shower everyday. Great product, my skin feels clean and matte after using (but not irritated or dried out). Have not had any break outs in a long time, use this at the end of each day after taking off my makeup. Lasts a long time ( I only need 1 pump and it's enough to cleanse my whole face.) Good product for anyone look for a good cleanser with less questionable crap in it. I love this cleanser. It's extremely gentle on skin,  and has a light fragrance that is gender-neutral so it is great for use by anyone in the household. Great value for the quantity and it does foam when mixed with a bit of water so a little goes a long way. Note that there is a different version called ""creamy formula"" which is unscented and does NOT foam. The two look very similar. This review is for the ""foaming formula"" which I prefer. Gentle cleaning formula so that my face does not dry out. I use this cleanser with an electronic face brush every night and it works wonders for my complexion. Even on days I wear makeup and wash off, my skin feels clean and smooth. I always use this product. I find it very gentle on my face.  Priced cheaper than discount stores. This cleanser is perfect for those with sensitive skin. Love this stuff.  It has a strong yet pleasant scent that disappears quickly.  Won't help for acne, but doesn't dry out skin and leaves skin feeling fresh and nice.  Hard to find in stores, so I buy it here. My dermatologist recommended this after fraxel.  Still using it. Great product for sensitive skin. Great for my sensitive face skin. Neutrogena is great for my skin Very nice gentle cleanser.  Feels really nice. Great product. Use everyday Finally something I can use on my face that doesn't make me a *#%@$ break out I really like this cleanser and would purchase again. I love this gentle cleanser! I use it with my Mia ultrasonic brush. No irritation. Glad I can buy it on Amazon! Can't go wrong with this face wash, it had made my skincare routine so simple. It never broke me out as well, I love how it's also affordable!! Definitely recommended!! Reduces acne gently cleanses no irritation love it Very gentle foaming face wash. Face feels clean and easily removes makeup with one pump without drying my face. Very gentle on my skin as I use prescription medications and it doesn't irritate it at all. HIGHLY recommend. Love this stuff. I have super sensitive skin and it doesn't make me break out. Shipped and arrived right on time. This is my HG cleanser. Affordable, easy to find, and works amazingly. I apply twice a day with a konjac sponge. This cleanser is very gentle on my oily skin and cleans nicely. It doesn't break me out or dry my skin out. Love it! I have very oily and Sesotho every skin. It washes away all makeup, dirt and oil without leaving a residue behind. I love the Foaming Formula. It bubbles up nicely, is very gentle, and has a nice scent. Be forewarned that the Creamy Formula doesn't suds up at all - but this one does I use this every day on my face.  Washes off dirt and makeup really well, but doesn't dry out my skin. Actually the world's best face wash. Been using for two years now, and I'll never go back. Great size and bargain.  It gently cleans my skin and is exactly what I wanted. Glad to have a source and hope to continue to buy them for a long time.  This is just what my dry skin needs I use this cleanser with my clairasonic facial brush and I am pleased thus far, as I have combination sensitive skin. best face wash ever! mild and works great not irritating This helps my skin stay clear and smooth and its huge. I ordered the Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Daily Cleanser and am very pleased with it. It has no smell that I can detect and it is not drying and is gentle on my skin. Some products I have used made my skin break out, but after using product for four weeks I have not had a problem. Also, the price is very reasonable so I can afford it. Will continue to use this product. I purchased this cleanser after my dermatologist recommended it as being one of the most gentle, effective cleansers. I really like Neutrogena products and this did not disappoint. It does not have a strong scent and lathers really nicely. I use it with my Clarasonic and it works beautifully. My skin feels very clean and not too dry after using. I purchased this though amazon after seeing how much more expensive it was everywhere else. Great buy! Love this face wash for my sensitive skin Great for sensitive skin very gentle and does not dry out skin! Can't imagine what product the naysayers were using!Lasts a very long time, need very little to lather. The fragrance is very light. My husband has a wicked sensitivity to fragrances. This one he can use, no problem. Great product! This is the only soap that work for my face, it makes my face feel so soft. It does not dry my face out at all. I am now a fan! Wonderful product will be buying more... Luv this product. Very gentle on my sensitive skin. Very cleab non greasy feel aftee wash. I have VERY sensitive skin. I was given sampled from my Dermatologist. I will use nothing but this to wash my face. VERY PLEASED a great face wash This is a great product! But don't make the mistake of confusing it with the hydrating version. It was a disappointment. I am 75 and my face needs to be washed at least twice a day but anything harsh would be detrimental to my skin. This is an excellent affordable alternative to the high-priced skin care products I was using before. Excellent quality! Very gentle yet cleans. Love it! I don't really notice the fragrance. It cleans makeup off, but doesn't over dry. Thank you the perfect product for everyday use! I got a sample for this Neutrogena Daily cleanser from rent the runway. When I used it I really liked the smell. I also liked how soft and clean my face felt after washing my face. The little sample bottled lasted me for more than a week since I used small amounts of the cleanser in the morning and at night. I really did see a difference in my skin many of my pimples were not visible anymore in about two to three days. I looked for this product at many pharmacies with no luck, and then recently I googled it and found it here and ordered it. I ordered it on Friday and it was delivered to me on Sunday which was great because I got to use it right away. The bottle is big it looks like it could last a couple of months. It has a nice smell, its not as ""perfumy"" as the sample I got before. I also noticed that some of my pimples are gone and it has just been three days since I started using it. I do recommend this product! I LOVE this cleanser. I have had acne for over 10 years and whenever I would use up a bottle of cleanser I would move on to a different one, hoping it would be ""the one."" This is it for me! My skin is incredibly sensitive and I have either broken out or had allergic reactions to a plethora of different products. This cleanser does not leave me feeling tight or dry at all-- I typically only use it at night and just rinse with water in the morning, but I can use it twice a day with no ill effects. It is fantastic at removing makeup and (chemical) sunscreen on its own, though my personal preference is to use sweet almond oil to break everything up first.Normally I would avoid ANY product with fragrance as it can be irritating, but there seems to be very little in this cleanser as it doesn't smell like much of anything, and so far no reactions to it either. works great for fair skin, or for people with sensitive skin. Nice and great for my skin. Smells nice, cleans makeup off well. Leaves skin soft. Will not buy any other product. I have adult-onset cystic acne and fail with more products than I succeed with in avoiding breakouts. I love this wash. It is so gentle, and the smell is wonderful. I haven't had a breakout since starting it two months ago. I have also had changes to my prescription medications during that time that could be contributing to that, but at the very least, even if it didn't help improve my adult acne, it certainly hasn't worsened it. I also have very sensitive skin and am certain I have allergies that cause contact dermatitis and red, inflamed skin on my neck and chest regularly, though I can never seem to narrow down what products are doing this. But like with the acne, this too I can be certain does not cause it. It is fantastic!  I like it much better than other ""sensitive"" washes like Cetaphil. Foaming is better Very gentle on my face. Neutrogena never disappoints! This gentle daily cleanser pampers my sensitive skin - I have my young children use it also! Leaves skin soft and clean. Excellent product for dry skin or dry climate. Not greasy. Arrived in sturdy packaging on time. I have sensitive skin and am allergic to a chemical that is in preservatives in many beauty products.  This cleanser does not irritate my skin at all.  I even use it as a body wash when I travel since then I only have to pack one product vs packing this and a body soap. Good product! Just as advertised I used to use Cetaphil face wash but my dermatologist put me on this because it is less drying.  I actually like it much better.  It is gentle and feels great after. I have extremely sensitive skin and have to be very careful what products I use to avoid breaking out. This one has been wonderful for cleansing my face. It smells a lot like ""No More Tears"" Shampoo, so it has a pleasing scent and is very handy with the pump dispenser on top.. Simple cleanser with pleasant smell, so gentle I can use it on my sensitive skin twice daily without over drying. A must have if you are looking for a simple cleanser. I am in my 40s and have VERY sensitive skin. I break out when my skin gets too dry, and it seems most cleansers aren't gentle enough. My skin feels fantastic after using this cleanser over the last month. It feels clean, but it also feels like it hasn't been stripped! I had been using one particular product for years, and the company changed the formula and my face would not stop breaking out. I had a hard time finding a new face wash that didn't break my face out due to over-drying. As soon as I started using this product my skin stopped breaking out and got some bounce back.  I am so glad I tried the Neutrogena Ultra Gentle cleanser because my skin is really happy with whatever is in it ( or NOT in it)! I would give it 10 stars. I am a cleanser junkie, I love trying different brands since the rest of my skin care products rarely change.  I like this cleanser a lot even though it has fragrance in it. It does a great job taking off makeup including eyeliner and mascara (not sure about waterproof) very quickly and leaves my sensitive combination clean but not dry.  Even though this has fragrance, it's not too heavy and it doesn't cause issues since it is rinsed from my face rather quickly. I was using a non-sudsing cleanser for many years that was recommended by my dermatologists. However, for the past few years I've tried several cleansers and felt a bit like Goldilocks...the cleansers were either too drying or didn't cleanse my skin adequately. But this is one of the few that works well for my skin.I wash my face three times a day with this - in the morning, in the evening, then right before bedtime. The product lathers just enough to remove oil from my t-zone and oily eyelid area while allowing my skin to retain moisture. It also doesn't irritate my skin.  Love it! I have sensitive combination skin. Prior to using this product I was breaking out constantly and my forehead had many small blemishes. I've been using this cleanser consistently for over a month now (morning and night) and the results have been incredible. The bumps on my forehead are gone and I've only had a few blemishes here and there, but nothing compared to before. It does have a fragrant smell but its not intolerable. I'm very happy and would highly recommend to anyone with sensitive skin! Forewarning, this is a long review because I am very excited.Before starting a full Neutrogena system I was wearing lots of unhealthy makeup and not washing my face properly. It wasn't until I started noticing my acne was scarring my face, that I realized it was time for a healthy change. After hours of research on the different drugstore skincare/makeup products, I decided to go for a full regimen of Neutrogena. I have oily/combination skin and acne, so strictly cream cleansers do not work for me, yet most foaming ones dry me out and leave my skin feeling stripped and tight.  This cleanser, however, is perfect. It protects the moisture of my skin while cleaning it thoroughly.I also bought the pore refining toner, anti-aging cream, anti-aging perfecting foundation, healthy skin powder,  healthy skin blush and bronzer. My skin is looking and feeling better from just a few days of this regimen. I am young, but I was starting to noticed lots of fine lines, scarring, and discoloration already. I feel like this new skincare/makeup regimen was the best decision for the future of my skin. As for the other Neutrogena products I bought, I highly recommend them as well! My skin is thanking me! It feels nice to have sheer coverage that is actually beneficial, for once. My skin is starting to look like what I tried so hard for with layers of unhealthy makeup. So if you can tough out the couple weeks it takes for these products to repair your skin, it is very much worth it in the long run! Highly recommend. I've been a Neutrogena girl for about 15 years now. I have ""graduated"" to more sophisticated make-ups, lotions, and treatments, but I always go back to the basics for a good clean wash that removes all my make-up, but doesn't strip my skin. This is the stuff!!! My step-mom is a dermatologist, so I could get any number of potions for my face, but I love this above all else. People ask me frequently what my skin routine is and they're always surprised when I tell them I wash with this. I stick with what works! I really like this facial cleanser. I have super hyper ultra sensitive skin and neutrogena's ultra gentle daily cleanser works well on my skin. I really LIKE the fragrance of this face wash and my skin is not irritated or red after using it. Keep the formula the way it is and and the fragrance too! :-) I also use neutrogena's deep clean scrub for sensitive skin and alternate with st. ive's scrubs ( I use a very hydrating moisturing cream after using my toner) and it seems to help with my acne. I am in my mid-late 20s. I'm just thankful I've finally found my soul mate face wash. :-) Try it, make your own opinion and don't listen to the negatives. Your skin is going to react differently than others or mine, so see for yourself. I've tried a lot of different brands out there even trying to go natural or organic and had all kinds of skin reactions. This is the only wash that does not irritate my skin nor does it make my skin red. It's awesome! I love this stuff.  Since having children, my face has been prone to breakouts.  I have always had rather sensitive skin, but once I entered my 20s and 30s, I started having breakouts.  This has cleared it up.  I wash with this and follow up with jojaba oil during the day, which also fights acne, and almond oil at night, which is more moisturizing.  (During the winter, when it gets really dry, I use the almond both times)I am so glad I realized that my face is not overly oily, but it was the harsher face washes I was using.  When you dry your skin out with overdrying washes, it naturally reacts by producing more oil.  The current combination of this gentle wash and the natural oils have finally balanced everything out and made my skin happy. I was skeptical about this cleanser at first- I've heard about it and immediately came to Amazon to read reviews before I bought it- I'm used to using Dermalogica Special Cleansing Gel- this is very similar to that- I too don't have a tolerance for strong smells- it does have a fragrance but it does't bother me at all- infact, I only noticed the first couple times- but now it smells clean & fresh- it does exactly what it says for less then half the price I usually pay for Dermalogica- doesn't strip my skin or dry me out or make me oily- I have combo skin and this cleanser seems to make everything even out- I really like it- it takes off my makeup super easily- I will wash twice to make sure it's all gone, then follow up with a scrub- I have horses and am usually really dirty by the evening from working them and and working in the backyard- if you came here to read about it, it's worth a try, won't make a big dent in your pocket book buying a bottle- Love this product. Cleans well. No residue. No drying. No irritation. No break outs. Great sensitive skin product. I have super hyper-reactive skin and am allergic to almost all face washes, sunscreens, make ups, etc.  This is the first wash I have used and absolutly love.  Yes it has a fragerence, but it is a clean nice smell.  It doesn't bother me at all.  This cleanser works especially well with a clarisonic.  I use this twice a day, and you neutrogena hydro boost water gel for moisturizer.  My skin has never looked better.  Bye bye rashes and pimples! Using now. Wish I had checked. Prefer non foamy. But it's okay. really like this product, doesn't have a funky smell. Gentle. Will purchase again. Product cleans facial skin well without over drying. I'm 32 with combination skin and some minor hormonal acne. My T-zone is oily, but around my nose and chin gets super dry during the winter months.  After years of trying new products to help balance my skin and eliminate breakouts, I've found the answer.As I've gotten older, harsh acne treatments only make my skin RAGE.  This cleanser confirms to me that my skin is SUPER sensitive.  When I ran out of this and went back to another ""soap-free, as gentle as water"" cleanser, my face hated me for it.  I went straight back to the drugstore for this and the difference is remarkable.  I'm still able to spot-treat the blemishes, but this helps keep my skin hydrated so it doesn't crack and flake like a lizard.  (So gross!)I don't notice any strong perfumes, like some other people.  This product does NOT foam up at all, so be aware of that.  I wear a full face of makeup and this takes it all off, no problem.  I typically do two washes on my face to get everything off, but it leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated.  Your skin shouldn't feel tight after cleansing.  If so, it's too harsh for you!If you have tried everything on the shelf and you continue to have new breakouts, I recommend making your skin care routine as simple and GENTLE as possible.  Cleanse with this, moisturize with something for sensitive skin and spot-treat your blemishes with a benzoyl-peroxide/salicylic acid gel (ONLY on the spots, not all over your face).  All this time I thought I was ""acne-prone"" but I'm just SENSITIVE.  Harsh products make it worse, but this chills everything out.  Give it a try! I have sensitive skin, so it's difficult to find products that work with my skin. I usually use CeraVe's hydrating cleanser because it's fragrance-free and contains hyaluronic acid, which is recommended when you're in your late 30's.I received a bottle of Neutrogena's Ultra-Gentle Daily Cleanser and decided to give it a try. Although it contains fragrance, it wasn't over-bearing and it didn't affect my skin. The cleanser is very mild and gentle and left my skin soft.I usually find foaming cleansers are drying, but this one wasn't. Some other positives were that the pump bottle was easy to use and a little goes a long way.I'm going to stick to using CeraVe, but I was pleasantly surprised with this product and will definitely use it again. Neutrogena is a great brand and I really like that they're less pricier than others and do offer products for sensitive skin. it is exactly what you think it is.  its wonderful and it leaves your skin feeling so soft but no greasy residue.  its worth the money and i didnt think it would be. I have sensitive, combination skin and it's been more trouble since I started using Retin A. I used to use another Neutrogena cleanser and then Cetaphil, but both were too strong and irritable. I would break out immediately. I started to use CeraVe, which had a similar texture to this one and then finally ended up with this Ultra Gentle Neutrogena cleanser. It's been heaven. From day 1, there were no reactions or breakouts, and it's been consistently keeping my pores clean.A few things to know:- Yes, it does have a slight fragrance but it did not irritate my sensitive skin- People seem to think it doesn't foam but yes, it foams when you wet it and rub your hands together- The ingredients are straightforward, very few parabens for those who care- It removes heavy-duty makeup, sometimes requiring two rounds of washing- The cleanser doesn't dry out my skin, which is important because of Retin A- Some cleansers feel waxy but this one comes off completelyI do wish they made a version without fragrance because even though it hasn't bothered my skin, I develop associations with smells and this has a very common smell, so I think I smell my cleanser everywhere I go. The paranoia is real. Nice feel First, some background:  I'm twenty-five years old and I've been dealing with acne breakouts since my junior year of high school.  The first two years were really bad, but over time it's mellowed out.  I'm still classified by my dermatologist as having ""adult acne,"" but all I have to worry about these days is a small area of skin on the right side of my chin.  That said, if I miss just one day of treating my skin with prescribed solutions and lotions, I will wake up the next morning with a terrible breakout.However, before I apply my prescription treatments, I have to make sure my face is very clean.  Previously I had been using Clean & Clear Foaming Facial Cleanser.  It got the job done as far as the breakouts went, but there were some drawbacks.  First, the smell was pretty awful.  More importantly though, it left my skin (particularly around my nose) very dry and sore - almost like frostbite.  It could even appear enflamed at times.  I actually had to get my dermatologist to prescribe some Desonide Lotion, just to treat the dryness.This Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Daily Cleanser smells infinitely better than the Clean & Clear, and, while it does leave a bit of facial tightening afterward, it doesn't dry my skin out anywhere near as badly.  I also have to say that the Amazon price is a great deal.  This is a pretty substantial bottle of cleanser.In short, I'm sold as a convert.  I'm trading in the Clean & Clear for Neutrogena.  I can't afford the cleanser my dermatologist sells over-the-counter at $30 a bottle, but this will certainly suffice. Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Daily cleanser is a new development by this company which is a great facial cleaner. Not only is it gentle on the face, but has a clean, refreshing smell! This product will leave your face feeling clean and does not irritate the skin. An added bonus is the pump they give you. It makes it very easy to get the cleaner out of the bottle and you can control the amount you get so there is very little waste.  My wife really loves it!!! The product has been used for over a month by my 19 yr-old daughter.  She normally uses ""cheaper"" brands than Neutrogena but sings high praises for this product.  Coming home from a 5-6 hour stint on her feet waitressing in an indoor/outdoor restaurant, her skin can feel pretty grimy.  This product is something she enjoys using and really endorses, keeping in mind previous cleansers were either the RiteAid brand or its price competitors. I have Rosacea, so my face is extremely sensitive. I had tried every product on the market for Rosacea, and even the ones that people raved about would burn my face and eyes. For awhile I was just washing my face with oil, but missed the convenience of a pump bottle in the shower. I first tried the anti-redness line, and I was shocked to see the ingredients in them! The cream wash actually has alpha hydroxy which definitely causes redness in even normal skin. I was nervous about trying this product since I saw the word ""fragrance"", but I was amazed with how good it felt on my face. There is no burning at all, my face actually feels clean, doesn't dry out my skin, and it smells great. Definitely give it a try if you have sensitive skin. Awesome! My 18 year old son loves it! Please never discontinue this! I tried cetaphil and cerave and purpose cleanser, and they all made me break out. I love this cleanser. It is my HG. The best cleanser I've ever tried. Gentle, lightly scented cleanser that did a good job removing my makeup which is a feat in itself.  No allergic reactions, break outs or dry skin.  It says it foams but mine did not it was the consistency of clear hand soap with the same kind of pump on top.  Honestly the best part is that it's a big bottle for $8 or $9 that has lasted me 3 months and I use it at least once a day and usually twice a day. Title pretty much says it all. This is the best cleanser I've used and I'm a self-proclaimed product junkie. I normally shy away from grocery store cleansers (marketing for the high end stuff always sucked me in), but wanted to simplify my overall skin care regime (and not spend as much). This cleanser is a gem. Absolutely no faults with it for my acne-prone, although dry, skin. No parabens (I'm paranoid about them) or lots of other junk in it. I would have picked up Cetaphil's gentle cleanser (because I love, love, love, their moisturizing cream), but it has parabens - argh! Anyway, this turned out to be a great buy and I'm very happy. I've given my friends my Roche Posay, Shu Uemura and Shiseido cleansers. I'm a lifer for this, assuming they don't change it. I have mature extra dry skin. I use this daily. It is by far the only and I say only cleanser that does not dry my skin and make it tight. I am a junkie for trying things and believe me, I have not budged since I found this! If it ain't broke, don't fix it! (A review from my wife) I wasn't sure how this would work on my face as I have oily skin that is prone to breaking out.  I used this cleanser to wash my face after having worn make-up all day.  I then used my acne cleaning pads.  Usually these are really grimy from stuff having been left behind.  The pad came back almost completely clean.  I would definitely recommend this product.  I even like the very light scent. This product from reputable company lives up to its reputation. It removes makeup with no residue or greasy feeling. This is a product we will continue to use. This really is gentle and the smell is nice and light. I use twice a day, morning and evening. Take it from a girl who can't live without black eyeliner/shadow - it's good for taking off eye make upA tip I'd pass on is this : a little goes a long way. A full pump is too much unless your face is a large pizza. A pea-sized amount is plenty for me. Rinse off well as it can make you blow nose bubbles!"
B00GTC1H5U," Great size and exfoliates gently Only thing that gives me clear skin! Great deal.  Lovevtge smell! Smells so good and does the job to scrub off dirt Great scrub. Thanks! Smells amazing and feels so good on my skin. Very nice. Leaves skin feeling soft and supple. Makes your skin feel clean and tight This stuff has done WONDERS on my skin. I live in a tropical climate and I'm in and out of salt water/pools all day. I love that this is a cleansing CREAM and doesn't foam up. My skin is nice and hydrated now without any over stripping. PLEASE DON'T EVER DISCONTINUE THIS PRODUCT! Finally found the scrub in a tub instead of a tube.  Been using this face scrub for years and your face feels feel fresh after every use. I love this flavor! Haven’t found it in stores locally! I will re-purchase in the future for sure. Love the way this feels on my skin, the exfoliating beads are a plus for the dry winter months. Great scrub! Not too runny, not too harsh. I've been using this for years. Highly recommend! usually get the apricot but this one smells better and is slightly less abrasive very nice This is my new favorite scrub! It's not too tough and smells so nice. Great price for the size and definitely useful for dry damaged skin. It really seems to cleanse effectively and leaves skin very soft I've always loved St. Ives.  Smells great and provides the perfect level of exfoliation. A repeat buy for sure! Leaves your skin feeling softer and thoroughly cleansed! This product is a staple in my skincare routine. I only use it about twice a week and it works great for my sensitive skin. It's light scrub that actually does leave your face feeling fresh. Smell so good and leaves you skin soft and clean Love this product! I honestly can't say enough good things about it. I also really like that I can stock up so I never run out. Can't live without this! Great value! Deep cleans! pretty good. I love it!  It feels sooooo smooth :-) Great for sensitive face. very gentle scrub...this is one of their milder scrubs Keeps the face refreshing I love this stuff. It's a fine, gentle scrub. Works great St. Ives is one of the best and this smell is great My adult children love these St Ives products. I’m 45, been using this for years.  Keeps my skin smooth, I barely have any wrinkles or crows feet, think this is a big part of that.  Great exfoliator. Nice refreshing scrub. I am prone to breaking out and this doesn't seem to be a problem love it after 1st wash!!!!!light scent and foamy with microbeads!!!!!im shopping for more st. lves products NOW!!!! Love this scrub! It has done wonders on my oily face. I will keep using it until..forever! Nice item A+ I love this stuff and it is so awesome i can order online and it only took 2 days to get here...the smell is amazing as well ...it's so gentle Pretty good face scrub it’s definitely helped with my black heads What an awesome buy. I will definitely purchase again I thought this was going to be a small container but it was actually very big and a good size. I loved the smell and using this. I definitely recommend this! I love this cleanser and used it for many years. great product  !!!! Such a good deal I return this one by mistake. Why spend more? Can't beat the price !!! Unlike other people let me start by saying that I bought this item at full price and received no compensation for writing this review...this worked very well for me it's a great face wash and left my face clean and refreshed, I have been buying and using this for some time and am always happy wit it, it is well worth the money. I'm in a competition with my friend so [...] Smells great, feels sandy, does a great job of scrubbing. I used a brush instead of my fingers to work this into my skin and it was brilliant. Also literally smelled good enough to eat and when I accidentally got some in my mouth it didn't taste completely awful so that's a bonus? It actually did an amazing job of exfoliating my lips, way better than a dedicated sugar scrub. I've used this scrub daily in the shower for years. Have tried other kinds, but always come back to my favorite pink grapefruit by St. Ives. Gentle enough for daily use, buffs away dead cells leaving my face smooth and healthy. After several years of long-term use, a few months ago I noticed a distinct line on my neck where I always stopped using the scrub--above it was brighter and smooth, below it the texture was rough and darker. That was true proof this works!!Now I use this scrub all the way down from forehead to decollete line on my chest, gently working away the dead skin to exfoliate and brighten. No more line--my whole upper skin shines! Love this scrub!!HIGHLY RECOMMEND--affordable, works excellent, and is great for your skin. I purchased this scrub at Target, and absolutely love it!  It is a million times better than the more common St. Ives Apricot scrub.  This scrub has a delicious grapefruit scent, and feels like an ultra fine sugar/salt scrub specifically designed for your face.  Where the St. Ives Apricot scrub is made of a thick, somewhat heavy feeling base liquid that always seems to take forever to rinse off of my skin, this Even & Bright scrub has a lighter base liquid mixed in with the sugar/salt exfoliant, which rinses clean pretty quickly.I have normal to dry skin, and in the winter my face becomes extremely dry and dull.  I struggle with little bits of dead skin flakes all over my nose, and sometimes other parts of my face, and am miserable.  Using this scrub, however, is the perfect treatment for my over dry and dull winter skin.  I keep it in my shower and use it every other day.  I just take a few minutes in the shower to lightly massage my face with this scrub, and when I'm done, all I need to do is moisturize my face, as the dead skin flakes have all been exfoliated away.  I also have skin that can be sensitive and irritate easily, but this scrub has not given me any bad reactions or irritation whatsoever.  I wish the St. Ives company would have introduced this scrub years ago, as it works so much better than the Apricot scrub, and rinses cleaner too. I highly recommend for an effective exfoliating scrub.  It is very difficult to find in stores, so I am thrilled that it is available via Amazon. St. Ives Nourished and Smooth Scrub and Mask is a staple in our home. The smell gives me the sense that it is summer time and I am at the pool around plastic play toys (I love the smell of those things). The smell alone is enough for me to buy this product.When I am in the shower, I spread this all over my face, first thing. I let the product sit (it is a mask after all) during my shower and it softens my skin and gives me a spa experience with the smell of summer permeating the bath.The actual scrubbers are very light and do not heavily exfoliate which is nice sometimes when you do not need a heavy scrubbing. The product moisturizes and sloths away dead skin to reveal supple skin. I love this product and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to add a little spa like product to your line up! I just purchased this new scrub. Like the other reviewer's, I've used St. Ives Apricot Scrub for years. I absolutely love it. But when I went to my local store and saw that all of the apricot scrubs were already purchased, I found this wonderful surprise sitting all by it's lonesome. I love the exfoliating action of st. Ives products and so on a whim, I decided to purchase this.This scrub is phenominal! I'm not a fan of anything orange flavored or scented, but this smells wonderful. And although it is light and creamy (much lighter in texture/color than the apricot scrub), it's exfoliative action is  powerful!  After my very first use, my skin was bright and glowing. It looked/feltvery clean.This definitely will be my new go-to product, and I think St. Ives has found a lifelong  Even and Bright fan in me.I will highly recommend this to anyone looking for a new scrub from this company. Absolutely love this scrub! Originally, I bought a small, travel size Green Tea scrub at Walmart just to give it a try. Like most people who love St.Ives products, I have used the Apricot Scrub many times in the past, but this was a scent I have not seen before and I LOVE Green Tea everything, so had to try it out and I am so glad I did. A few days later I was so in love, I purchased this 6 Oz tube on Amazon and have used it for the past 5 months daily.Just a little bit of this product goes a long way. I use it once a day usually in the mornings and I am almost out now and will be purchasing a new tube, but 6 ounces lasted me almost half a year. For less than $10, thats an awesome deal. Additionally, every other day I use this scrub with the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz, 1-Count instead of the Olay scrub which it comes with. I have noticed that my blackheads have almost completely disappeared. It's incredible! In the evenings, I use Naturally Clear Green Tea Cleanser for Unisex By St.Ives, 6.75 Ounce because the scent is just as amazing but the cleanser helps to remove the makeup easier and cleanses my skin from the daily dirt.I have an oily T zone and sensitive skin and a lot of other products make me break out, but not this scrub. This scrub works amazingly! It is so gentle on the skin because the scrub grains are smaller and lighter than those that are originally in the Apricot scrub, but it exfoliates just as well! My skin is always glowing after I use this product, and feels so clean without making my face red.I recommend this scrub to all my friends. I'm in love! I have suffered from bad acne for over 15 years. I have tried everything over the counter and prescription, but nothing worked. I always had blackheads on my nose and chin. Absolutely nothing at all in the past has worked for me like the St. Ives Blackhead Clearing Scrub Green Tea. I love Green Tea because of all the antioxidants. I saw this new product last year and decided to try it. It works so well- my husband is now addicted to it!!I used to use the Apricot Scrub but that was too harsh on my skin.  The green tea is extremely gently yet very effective in getting off makeup, dead skin, acne, and restoring youthful skin. My acne has cleared up and the scrub also has helped with fading my scars. I am very impressed. My husband and I have been using this product for over a year and haven’t made a change since!! I have minor but stubborn acne, and prominent blackheads that are difficult to keep away. This product works like no other product I've tried. Without drying my skin in the slightest, I can use this on a daily basis to keep my blackheads at bay, tighten my pores, and flush away acne. I feel more confident, and I love how I don't have to spend so much on a scrub, or constantly turn to facial strips. I am so happy with this, and with the price as well, I was very surprised. Please never change this product, or replace it, I am definitely going to buy more of this once I run out. Love this product!I have moderate acne, and severe redness on my cheeks. I've used neutrogena acne wash (a bunch of theirs,) elf skincare products, generic (target) stuff, and this has worked best for me so far. I knew I liked green tea products, because I used a target brand one and it worked well, but it was a little too thick and scratchy for me- the saint ives one was perfect! Very gentle. A big reason I like it is because it drastically reduces redness for me. I think any green tea product will help that, but this one really is great. It also clears up my acne really fast- I use it at night and the next morning any blemishes I have are pretty much gone. My only complaint is that it doesn't help blackheads THAT much- it cleared some of the ones on my nose, but not so much on my cheeks. This may be on my part, as I've been using my hands to apply it- I may need to use a little brush to really scrub it in. Overall, great product. Smells nice, too- not overpowering and doesn't smell like chemicals like some products I've used.  I also enjoy the saint Ives moisturizer I've been using. With skincare, it's really a matter of finding what works best for YOU- it's not universal, but at this price I say give saint Ives a chance. I absolutely love St. Ives products! I'm finding that the older I'm getting the more my needs change in terms of my skin care regiment. I was using the St. Ives Apricot Scrub but because I have extremely sensitive skin the older I'm getting and with the weather being so frigid here in New England, I had to change because it was too coarse for my skin. I ended up ordering this oatmeal based scrub instead and it is smooth, silky and excellent for my skin. Not only that I have seen better visual results in terms of my pores being much more clean and it smoothes away those fine lines much better than I could have imagined. I feel great I think I look great and I'm incredibly happy with this product. Not only that you can't beat the price. St. Ives offers a true natural product that gives you excellent results without having to break the bank. Give it a try. If you have sensitive skin try this product first. The apricot scrub is harder and more rough so it's more suited for those who do not have sensitive skin issues. I enjoy this product better than the apricot scrub because the grit is a finer consistency. Smells amazing and is gentle on skin, plus I have very sensitive skin so I love that it contains oatmeal. Will definitely purchase again! like as masque, wouldn't use as ""scrub"" on sensitive skin.  Pleasantly surprised for sensitive, aging skin, 45.  No rosacea flares or other irritation.  Not using daily.  Also like Neutrogena pore refining scrub, equally gentle. Just received this product yesterday and I am already in love. After the first use you can already feel how soft your skin is and you can visually see the difference. If you are scared of buying it because of the reviews about being ""too rough"" don't listen to them! This scrub is not rough unless you over massage it into your skin. Simply taking a small amount and applying it to your face softly massaging does all the exfoliating you will need. No need to scrub it into your skin because then, it will become too rough. It has a pretty creamy, thick texture and goes on smoothly. The scrub has a very clean scent. I wouldn't say apricot-y but it is a pleasant somewhat sweet smell. These two jars arrive extremely full, all the way to the top! I have been using what's on the lid and that alone could last you a week even using it multiple times a day. The actual jar, honestly it would last you a solid year-year and a half depending on how often and how much you use. Extremely fast shipping, shipped in two days. It was a little odd to me how it didn't come with some kind of seal on the top of the jar but none the less it was filled to the top so I'm not complaining. St. Ives Apricot Scrub has already made my skin look AND feel amazing and I cannot wait to continue using this product for years to come. I have always tried multiple face products to see what works best for me and I will say this will be going on my list of products to continue to use. It is not rough on my skin and leaves it feeling great afterwards. It also smells really great and doesn't burn while using. I used it when I woke up and before I went to bed and I feel it did do a good job of keeping my face clean and also ""waking me up"" in the morning time. I noticed a slight difference in my face but mostly in that it felt a lot smoother.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. 1.Can be used daily2.Your skin won't feel parched, dry, or stretchy which every other scrub does especially when you use it daily.3. I have sensitive combination skin and I love it, leaves my skin soft, smooth and clear.4. This is my second one and I am happy I found this great product at such a great price I'm a 60 year old woman who has always had oily skin with large pores.  This scrub does the best job of cleansing my face without leaving it over dry.  The grains in the scrub provide enough scrubbing power to leave my skin feeling clean, without it feeling overly-dry like some scrubs I've tried in the past.  The creamy part of the scrub seems to clean my pores much better than other soaps or cleansers I've tried and leaves them looking smaller.  My skin and my pores are two totally separate problems, and this scrub tackles both beautifully.  My skin feels really clean without being dry, and my pores are clean and appear smaller.  After a couple weeks using this I was totally sold.Another great selling feature is the price.  Compared to other scrubs or cleansers out there, you just can't find anything comparable that's this reasonably priced.  It's a huge jar and I need only a small amount to work up a good scrub and get the job done.I will definitely buy this product again! I LOVE this!!! The smell is so yummy, not only that but it really does exfoliate my skin really good! I exfoliate with this once a day, usually in the afternoon after taking off my make up and before applying my acne preventing lotions. I love it as a start to my night skin care routine because it really gets rid of all the crud and all the dirt in your face. After I exfoliate it leave my skin feeling fresh, soft, clean, and smelling amazing. Sometimes I go ahead and exfoliate my lips with it too, it really works wonderfully. I highly recommend because it feels natural and actually works Another great St. Ives product. I've used so many brands and many near the $5-10 each range, St. Ives is more affordable and as good or even better than most brands. My skin always feels great using this and their Apricot one, I alternate depending on season and going to the gym which makes me sweat a lot and these products keep my skin blemish free and not dried out! The perfect balance in a face wash. Glad I stopped paying $7-8 for other face washes that were giving me hit or miss results. It's good. I felt like the St. Ives apricot product was really good a few years ago, and then they went to a less abrasive formula. At that point, I started using the Target brand Up & Up, because it had stronger abrasive beads. However, I just purchased this St. Ives Lemon and Orange scrub earlier this month, and the abrasives are even better. They are smaller and finer than the Up & Up. I like it. I'm in love with st. Ives products. I have used the moisturizer before and this is my second bottle. I used the scrub and it's very mild and has good consistency. Just make sure you never put wet hands into the bottle. Just a small amount will be enough for entire face. Make sure your face is wet with water first or else it will get very rough. And do not scrub for very long. 3-4 minutes is good enough. I do it twice a week and it is really good product. I use this stuff and I love it! I could tell a difference within ONE USE!!  No joke. Smells great.I typically use it all over my face. From time to time, I use on my neck/chest and shoulder area. It is perfect for blemishes, blackheads, and just having great fresh smooth skin.I even bought one for one of my girlfriends. I love this product. There are small. tiny beads that easily exfoliated my dry, dead skin. What I liked the most what the consistency, it was smooth, creamy, and once you put it on your face, it was a nice, gentle exfoliation. Because the tiny beads were so small I feel like it literally got every dead skin cell. I am a person with maximum dry, dead skin and im telling you it works AMAZING! I did not purchase my tube through amazon, but I have to share how much I absolutely love this facial scrub. In the past, I tried proactive. My kit came with a free sample tube of their green tea moisturizer. It was amazing stuff. But that left me in search of a more affordable green tea product. I heard many people rave about st ives apricot scrub, so when I saw they also produce a green tea scrub, I HAD to try it.  It's a matcha green color with a yummy scent. It has a gentle gritty texture that really buffs away all the gunk and dead skin leaving my face feeling baby smooth. You get a lot of product. It literally only takes a penny size drop or less each wash. I don't think I will ever stop using this face scrub. Hopefully it's never discontinued! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT. I have used this for a long time primarily when my skin starts getting flaky or incredibly dry. As a practice I generally stay out of the sun or slather my self with sunscreen (spf 50 or above). I'm vain enough to not want alligator skin.Today I noticed that my skin was showing signs of too much sun exposure. Basically a farmer's tan on my arms and legs from too much time gardening. Anyway, I got a little freaked out and whipped out the St. Ives. I really like the apricot scent and its small granules of what I assume is apricot pit. I applied the stuff to my skin with a scruffy pad in a circular motion and used a slightly warm shower to watch the stuff off. I allied some in shower moisturizer, gave myself a second cool rinse, and dried off.Since my skin looked really gross, I was a little surprised by the results. My skin was smooth and was slightly pink and a whole lot younger looking. I guess because I only need this scrub mostly in the summer and winter, I forget just how good it is and how quickly I get big results. Anyway, two thumbs up on this one as it is an inexpensive and effective fix that also works great when applied to feet, ankles, and elbows, too. I'm typically not a huge fan of St. Ives scrubs as the apricot scrub is way too harsh for my sensitive skin, it always felt as though it was tearing my skin apart and not helping to exfoliate at all. I was researching scrubs and came across a plethora of products, all of which were ridiculously priced. I was looking for a gentle scrub, but not too gentle. This product is perfect! It almost feels like a microdermabrasion. The exfoliant is extremely fine, feels almost like baking soda and it's loaded with it! Not too gentle and not too harsh. The color has a light green tint to it, looks almost like pea soup. The scent is citrusy, very pleasing. After using the product, my skin was extremely smooth! I used a toner and moisturizer following the exfoliation and OH MY GOODNESS! I can't say enough positive things about this scrub. My skin looks clean, fresh, dewy, and just down right healthy! The price is phenomenal for such an awesome scrub. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on more expensive scrubs, this one works just as well if not BETTER than some of the top of the line ones. I'm sold, will use this forever as long as they continue to sell it. Three years ago, I discovered this product. I have not looked back since. I have relatively clear skin, and I get compliments a lot these days. That was not always the case. I have oily skin, and I used to get a new pimple every other day. It was so frustrating! My best friend was the first to discover this, and it really cleared her skin up. She recommended it to me, and we both have been faithful to this product ever since. For reference, I am African, and she is Caucasian. We have different types of skin and it worked wonders for both of us. I don't even use the Apricot or Grapefruit scrub- only this one. Why switch it up when you've found what works? It's only $2.50 at the Commissary too. What a steal! I've always used St. Ives scrub, ever since I was in high school. This is much smoother and more gentle than the older peach scented ones. I love it! Great face scrub, helps prepare my face for shaving.  Nice clean smooth feeling after use skin is refeshed. I love the smell so much, at times I find myself sniffing it in the shower.Overall its a great scrub at a great price! I prefer this GT scrub over the apricot only because the beads are a lot smaller and less abrasive against the skin, which allows me to use it twice in a day without dry skin. This is also very suitable for oily/sensitive and acne prone skin types, for GT = anti oxidant.My suggestion:Use it after a long day in steamy shower. That allows the fragrance to spread all over I used to get athletes foot all the time (swimming, wearing pantyhose all the time, etc). I realized that whenever I would spend a few days barefoot at the beach it would disappear. Hot sand, salt water, UV rays...  I also learned to shower twice a day and wash the feet with Dial whenever they were hot/sweaty. But still, once a summer, it would crop up and be nasty for a month till the medication got rid of it. I started thinking, how could I recreate the beach at home? Rub my feet in a sandbox? I tried this scrub which I have always loved for my face. Scrubbed my feet twice vigorously a day with this scrub *before* getting any water mixed in, then finished my shower as normal. Miracle. Athletes foot vanished. I still had to use the medication for a month for if I didn’t I would start to notice it creeping back. But otherwise it was undectacable. Sure beats symptoms for a month. My theory is that the scrub helps scrub away the fungus spores as well as sloughing off dead skin cells. I am going to make this a regular summertime foot scrub. Guys:When I first tried this, I didn't think it would be ""scrubby"" enough (like my old standby, the St. Ives Apricot scrub with ground walnut shells) to properly exfoliate my face and clean the pores, but I was wrong.  Everything about this product is wonderful. First off, the product has a bright and citrus-y scent for the morning (but not chemically or overpowering).  It's a very soft and creamy lotion with very tiny and smooth exfoliating beads (which at first didn't think would do anything, but they do. ...). The lotion goes on very smooth and as it mixes with a little water and you massage it onto your face, it makes a very gentle foam (very subtle though, not big soapy bubbles...) that literally smooths the tiny exfoliating beads over your skin and through your pores.......it's hard to describe, but when you rinse it off, your skin doesn't feel dry, and at the same time it it doesn't feel greasy or like there's a film still on it...it just feels very smooth and soothed.  While I like the St. Ive's Apricot scrub too, that is definitely ""rougher"" and exfoliates tougher skin, but it also tends to dry out my skin bit more (which for me is OK in the Summer but not the Winter.....). So if you have sensitive skin, or you want something that exfoliates but is still very gentle and really works, you should give this a try.  It's my new go to St. Ive's product. First, let me tell you a bit about my skin (this under my bf's name btw). I have oily skin that is usually filled with blackheads. It's super sensitive and I haven't been able to find something that works well without breaking out my skin. I noticed a difference on the first use. And, it smells wonderful. Make sure to clean your face thoroughly when washing it off. Great buy, actually. Can be found locally, so I'll probably buy it there from now on. Nonetheless, I like it. I work out a lot and sweat often, so I needed to get a good product with salicylic acid to help control and prevent breakouts. This is a great affordable option. I love the finer particles in this scrub. It leaves you with a gentle exfoliation, unlike St. Ive's apricot scrub. The size is great too, I've been using it daily for almost a month now and I'm not even halfway through the bottle (note I only use about a dime's worth of product in one day). I'll be purchasing this again when I'm through with this container :) I brought this from Target because I didn't want to 'add on' via amazon in order to get shipped. First of all, I do not easily write positive reviews about facial products because so far I came across only few ones that actually worked on me. I used to have a very bad cyst acne since college. Few years ago, I realized that it was the sugar! I pretty much cut down on my sugars and from time to time since then I would get minor pimples here and there. Last few months, I have been out on the market again looking for a decent daily face wash because usually in the morning I am in rush in order to get to work and I don't have the sweet time in the world to take care of my ''lovely'' face. I even tried one of those Avalon organic milk cleansing which suppose to have victim C- nope! it didn't not work, made my minor acne worse, and more than half of the bottle end in the trash can.I have tired some of the St.Ives products before but it has been hit and miss. I used to love their daily micro-dermo scrub but sadly they discontinued the products. Because this one(Pink and Orange Mandarin) contains lemon, I am like why not! Plus, it was dirt cheap. Omg!  so far I love this product. I have been using this past 3 weeks, my face looks better even my own mom commented on it. Off course, it didn't help much with my old acne scars but after using this product my skin feels fresh and clean without residue feeling. Plus, my skins looks much brighter now. Thank you St.Ives and I really hope you do not discontinue this product and maintain the quality for this. The St. Ives Even and Bright Pink Lemon and Mandarin Orange Scrub is a good lightly exfoliating facial scrub.  The scrub does a good job at exfoliating my skin without being harsh or overly abrasive, the scent is light and citrusy without being overpowering, and I haven't had issues with breakouts or skin irritation.  I actually really like this scrub in comparison to the Apricot Scrub, which is a bit too grainy and overly exfoliating.  While the scrub is effective at lightly cleaning and exfoliating, this scrub will not remove makeup, so you will need to remove your makeup before using this.  Also, be very careful not to get any of the bits into your eyes - I accidentally got a tiny grain in my eye, and while it didn't hurt, it was irritating as heck trying to get it out as it got right under my eye lid...ugh!  Overall this a nice addition to my daily face cleaning routine.  It helps slough away dead skin cells effectively and leaves my skin looking very fresh. This is a gift to my neice and she rates it 5/5 I actually purchased the apricot scrub by St Ives. I have been frustrated with all the little bumps on my face as I have aged. My daughter in law recommended the apricot scrub. I was amazed what a difference it has made in just 3 weeks to my skin. I am forgetful and only use it 3-4 times a week. I love this stuff. Even with very sensitive skin this product has been great for me. I love the entire line of St. Ives scrubs.  I am constantly rotating between all of them!  If you haven't tried, you should.  They exfoliate without cutting into your skin.  Even if you have open wounds, (pimples/ zits) it doesn't hurt, just exfoliates!  I especially love the smell of this one.  Very energizing for morning showers! St. Ives Even & Bright is not like their old standard apricot scrub I recall from my youth. The base is considerably less emollient than I remember and the exfoliating particles are smaller and more rounded than those old-school crushed walnut shells. This is a good thing, in my opinion! In fact, the Even & Bright and Green Tea varieties have become my new favorites for daily use, replacing the MUCH more expensive ""prestige"" brand of exfoliating scrub I've been using for many years. The sweet-but-not-cloying citrus scent is refreshing as well - much more pleasant than the glue-like smell of my pricier stuff. I ""clipped"" an Amazon coupon and got a good deal on a product I hadn't used before, totally on a whim - and I'm so glad I did. My skin feels soft and clean after use, neither oily nor dry. I've had no irritation or breakouts or negative reactions of any kind. I love the refined texture, more gentle exfoliating beads, and fresh, lemony-orange scent. I love this scrub...more than some of the other ones. I've long been a fan of their apricot scrub for exfoliating once or twice a week.  I like the way it smells and feels, but with my skin I can't really use it too terribly often or my skin would just feel raw.  This one, however, was a little smoother.  The exfoliating bits (I don't know what else to call them) are smaller and slightly less abrasive, so I feel like I could use this every day without any issues.The smell is pleasant and not overpowering.  I ordered one a few months ago and have ordered another since I'm about to run out.  This is definitely now a part of my beauty arsenal. This scrub is AMAZING!  I have oily skin with larget pores; my skin gets clogged up fairly easily.  After just a few uses, I noticed a definite improvement in my skin tone, and after using daily for about a week I had a nice ""glow"" about my skin.  It's exfoliation is relatively gentle, but it definitely does the trick.  My makeup goes on smoother and my skin looks a lot more radiant now.  I apply a nickel-sized amount to my fingertips and massage over cheeks, nose and forehead; I try to work the product around for 20-30 seconds before rinsing.  To all the reviews complaining about getting it in your eyes - it's an exfoliant product and it says right on the back of the tube to avoid contact with eyes!  If you are rubbing this product all over your entire face, including your eyelids (like a cleanser), then you are doing it wrong!  Avoid the entire eye area as it states on the tube and you will not be disappointed!  I also use it on my upper arms/shoulders and I've had a lot less breakouts (I tend to break out there due to workout-related sweating). I love this scrub soooo much, it has pretty much ruined me for any others out there. I have dry skin that's very sensitive and will break out if its slightly irritated. This scrub is so gentle yet exfoliating, my skin feels so clean and fresh afterwards. It smooths out my skin texture and does not leave my face dry and tight like most other scrubs do. It does not irritate any existing pimples I have. Oatmeal is great at soothing your skin and making it feel baby soft. I can't imagine using any other scrub now. Works great! my leather man Hyde has been smoothed and softened to a buttery suede. Love this stuff! I use it in the shower before shaving and always have a clean shave with no irritation. Gently to soothes on my skin.I use this St.Ives skin invigorating daily.I love the result.I don't have a dull dry skin now.The application is very simple just rub gently to remove the dirt dead skin and let it soak a couple minutes if you want the best result leave it more longer and you will see the difference.I love the fragrance.It's smells really good.The amount of the jar is good enough to cover up my months of using with this best product.I would suggest this to everyone.Disclosure:I got this product at discounted price in exchange for honest and unbiased review. I've used 5 different St. Ives products and this is by far my favorite. I love that it isn't too harsh on my skin and when I used it, it suds up. I like my face washing products to have bubbles because i feel its doing a better job (i know this isn't necessarily true but it gives me peace of mind to see bubbles when i was my face). This product clears up my skin so well and its sensitive enough to use everyday. I like that this face scrub is not runny. It is a thicker formula that turns a little sissy when wet. It leaves my face feeling smooth and gives me a great flow! I have been using it for a month now and I definitely notice the difference in my skin. Also, the mandarin and grapefruit scent is perfect, not overwhelming at all. Its hard to find in my local target or walgreens and was so glad to have it in Amazon. LOVE THIS. Makes my face so smooth, fresh and clean. Been using this for close to 7 years and have been VERY pleased. Exfoliation is wonderful and it doesn't leave my face all dry. Other salicylic acid containing face washes leave my skin very dry; Noxzema is the biggest offender. I use this about 3 times a week and one tub will last me a couple of months. This is an unbeatable value.Words of warning, the significant other cannot use this due to very sensitive skin. She must use all natural face cleaner. Although the container states ""100% Natural Exfoliants"" do not confuse this for a 100% natural face wash. The container does not lie though as the walnuts used as exfoliants are 100% natural; not the plastic exfoliating beads found in other face washes (which are banned in my local). I love St. Ives' face washes because 1) they use natural exfoliants; i.e., not microplastics or beads that end up in our waterways and foodwebs, 2) they're affordable, and 3) they work (at least some do, and for my combination skin)! I've used St Ives' apricot scrub the longest, just tried the green tea, and have to say, the pink lemon & mandarin scrub is my favorite. The apricot scrub is the most widely available in drugstores, so it's my go-to, but the exfoliants can be a bit abrasive. Somehow, after using the green tea wash, my skin never felt clean, so I won't be purchasing that one again. My skin has looked and felt the best when I've used the pink lemon & mandarin regularly - it's a bit more gentle than the apricot and leaves a nice, clean feeling! I like all the other stuff out there made of charcoal, wood, ash, plantains, banana peel and antelope horn wrapped in discarded pizza boxes.Look, for all the new stuff this is the best I have found.It is made of seed and walnut shell pulverized.It is the best exfoliator in my considered opinion.I have used exfoliator creams from Italy's Santa Maria Novella, and some stuff by J. Black, Nordstrom brand and even some of the modern goop you get from the places where the above mentioned pineapple peels and lemon wedge zest mixed with fine French clay and mud tracked from the sacred aboriginal gator nests or whatever. Save your money and go with a classic. You won't regret it. I have sensitive skin and usually, any facial cleanser or scrub that I use on my face breaks me out. I've tried a range of products and I had given up and just went to natural ingredients instead to cleanse and hydrate my face. This scrub showed up as a recommended product for me and I figured I would give it a try since it was so cheap. I want to note that I had tried the St. Ives grapefruit scrub and that product made me break out before. But the oatmeal scrub/mask is very gentle and did not irritate or cause my skin to breakout. I have been using this for about a month once a week and I am very pleased to have a moisturizing scrub that is so gentle on my face. I really like this cleanser. I have oily-ish skin and dry skin around my mouth. I needed an exfoliater, originally wanted to try the oatmeal one but they were out at Walmart, and bought this one instead for about 3$ or less. It's UNREAL how soft my skin is, even, and all! I love this stuff! And can't wait to try the oatmeal one. I use this every day. Definitely check other retailers, it was about 4.50 at Kmart, yikes! After self-diagnosing my husband with seborrheic dermatitis (he wasn't going to go to the doctor so I took matters into my own hands), I began to research products that would potentially help with my husband's skin. This product seems to have helped in the beginning, along with two other face moisturizers.  I'm not sure if he uses it as consistently as he should, but when he does, there is a difference.  He is only on his second bottle, and I believe he started using it around March of this year (2017), so I'm not sure if the bottle lasts a long time, or if he just doesn't use it everyday.I can't remember all of my specific research back when I began looking for products for his skin, but I chose this one due to it's ingredients and recommendations from others suffering from seborrheic dermatitis. I'll preface by saying I'm a 31 year old female with combination skin (dry on cheeks and oily on forehead, nose and chin). I have used many face cleansers over the years, including toners and moisturizers supposedly geared to help with my combination skin. I've even tried brands that are more ""natural"". I have hormonal acne which accumulates on the chin and jawline. Some weeks it seemed like I had a new pimple popping up every day. Since using the St. Ives exfoliant facial cleanser almost two weeks ago,  I have not had a single zit appear. I wash in the morning with the Even and Bright and in the evening I use the Blackhead Clearing Green Tea scrub. I'm not sure what makes this product superior to others (perhaps the natural exfoliants? I don't think it's the salicylic acid as I've used it in many cleansers before), but it's done great things for my skin. I don't feel like a girl going through puberty anymore. Hopefully they never discontinue this line of face cleansers."
B01GPCZUQK, Good for price All of the three products work really well. The Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Clear Skin Kit has really made my skin smooth and soft. I have noticed a much clear skin after using for a month. This is my go to brand for Acne related issues. Great
B00DTHJW64," Works well. Has a nice texture. No fragrance. Love PUR products! I use the BB cream/Sunscreen, Dirty Girl Mud Mask and this cleanser. Awesome stuff! Love this cleanser.

I have tried cheaper cleansers but keep going back to this one. It will is well worth it and lasts a long time. This is my second time buying this product, I love it combined with the get a lift cream for afterwards. I have been using it for about 3 years. My face feels clean and refreshed. The product has a nice orange smell to it. No issues, I love this product and will continue to use it. Lovely scent, and washes away waterproof makeup. I have sensitive skin, and it's been giving me a nice texture and glow. Love it! This is a great facial cleanser. It easily washes away my makeup and my skin feels great afterward with out feeling too dry and tight. It's my first time using and I definitely see myself buying it again I absolutely love PUR minerals cosmetics. I tried this cleanser about a year ago and have tried other washes but this is the best. It's worth the money and lasts me about 3 months. I use it with my MIA 1. It leaves my skin soft and clean without drying it out. It also does a great job at removing eye makeup and pairs well with PUR minerals Soak it Up moisturizer! I bought this  for a second time...my favorite. Love it! Arrived fast and does the job :-)"
B00T3ECKTS," Still giving my skin time to adjust to the change in products but seems to be going pretty well!  I've been fortunate most of my life to have nice skin but after reaching my early 30's suddenly I'm breaking out more often than I'm not.  After reading multiple reviews on this product, I decided to give it a shot and have been quite happy with the results!  The best price I found was here on Amazon so I ended up with free shipping too!I recommend slowly integrating it into your daily routine using it only once a day or every other day for 1-2 weeks then to twice a day, depending on how you respond.  This is especially a good idea if you have dry or sensitive skin. I have been using this for a few days and I love how bright my skin looks after patting it dry.  It has the appearance of a light dusting of foundation. Love this product! I have sensitive skin and have been looking for a glycolic cleanser. This fits the bill!I used it last night and woke up with soft, smooth skin. My other facial cleansers are going in the garbage.You will not be disappointed! I really do like this facial cleanser Everything was meet Love this product.  Gives your face a smooth clean feeling.  I use this, rotating with Lavo Microdermabrasion cream. Love this facial cleanser!  Not too harsh, but gets the job done.  My face feels clean and smooth. This product has helped get rid of fine lines.  I use it in the morning and before I go to bed. Love this product. Wait for the tingle!!!! This is a great product, and you will definitely see a difference in your skin. I highly recommend it."
B001E96L9A," daily Love this product Perfect and nice the best product love it Working wonders on my sensitive skin. Most products will cause irritation and dryness. Aveeno is one of the few brands I can use. Item shipped was the Aveeno Clear Complexion Foaming Cleanser. The item ordered and shown in pictures/description is Aveeno Positively Radiant Brightening Cleanser. Not sure how to get the right product now...However, the Brightening Cleanser is amazing. That’s why I gave it 5 stars. I have been using it for years. Very mild on the skin and does not mess with my natural skin oils like many soaps do. I have rosacea so I have to be careful about what I use on my face. This is nice. Cleans with no drying out of the skin. Good price and good customer relations. Order for hubby, he likes it because it's light. Aveeno my only skin are choice :) This is a great face cleaner.  I use it with an battery operated face cleaner.  It keeps my skin clean and soft.  I use it twice a day. My mom used this for ears as I was growing up and now I’m my adult years I am doing the same. Does not dry you out and works well with acne prone skin. I'm postpartum and dealt with some hormonal skin issues and this was the one product that helped to neutralize them. 10 months after and still using it every morning and evening. It's also great with makeup removal. Great cleanser, have used for years. Great for my sensitive skin. Excellent product, have been using it or years.  It keeps my skin looking healthy and youthful even without makeup! Great deal!!! I love this stuff. I found it while on vacation in California and it has become my go to fash wash that doesn't dry out my skin and always does a great job! already looking younger my entire family uses this product.  best product for the price.  the expensive ones don't have anything on this, except that they sting your eyes terribly!  this one does not.  good for my adolescent son. Love the feel and smell of it when you first open the bottle and with the cleanser and toner my face seems to be getting back to the ph level for nice skin. Highly recommend I have used this product for years. The product work great as always. It really cleans without being to harsh on my skin. Have used this for several years and found it cleans well and gently. It's the cleanser not the moisturizer but it says it on the description, I just didn't pay attention. Used this as a wash and loved it Makes my face more radiant and clean. Love this cleanser I'm 61 and this makes my face feel clean, fresh and soft. I love it! Great product, glad I can buy it off Amazon! THIS AVEENO SOAP MAKES MY FACE SMOOTH AND BABYLIKE. THIS IS THE ONLY SOAP I TRUST MY FACE WITH,& I'M VERY PICKY WHEN IT COMES TO FACIAL CLEANSING . IT ALSO MADE MY FACE A LITTLE LIGHTER , BUT OVERALL I'M A SATISFIED CUSTOMER. DELIVERY WAS EXTREMELY FAST... I always come back to this cleanser, and even if I use other things, I usually start with this to remove my sunblock and /or makeup. It is mild and not irritating, lasts a loooong time, and works great with my clarisonic. I have been using Aveeno for a long time.  It is my favorite cleanser.  What can I say about it, other than it is a good product and does what it is supposed to do.  But just like anything else, you have to find the cleanser that works best for you.  I do not wear liquid make up.  I sometimes wear powder and blush, and I have tried other cleansers (Oreal, Neutrogena), but I like this best. Works wonderfully Good product No matter how much makeup I wear (evening out, concert, etc.) I simply grab this, lather it up, spread it on my face and Voila! All make up comes off! No longer is the pesky makeup remover needed for my eyes (*& boy have I bought some expensive removers so my eyelashes wouldn't break).  This is gentle and powerful at the same time.Won't live without it.A definite must have. Great! great I really like this product...have reordered it several times. I have used this product for years and I love the way it makes my face feel like.  I have started other family memebers to use it.  Mostly my nephew who did not like washing his face uses it now every day. It really works and is soothing/calming. Not like harsh bleaches----VERY good alternative. Just love this stuff it does not get rid of brown spots lol as it states just a nice facial moisturizer is about it My Favorite facial Cleanser, my face looks bright always. This is the cleanser my daughter loves.  She is very happy with the quality of this product.  Thank you for making this possible! My skin looks great! The cleanser make my skin softer and with one use. Use the lotion that comes with this product. I've used this Aveeno facial cleanser for years. I tend to be a bit oily, and this one strikes just the right balances of cleansing my oiliness without drying me out. Love this product! Cleans all the makeup away without drying! Easy to use in the shower...bonus! This product has been my favorite facial cleanser for many years. Works great Great product, it's all I've used on my face for years now, doesn't dry out my skin too much This is the product that I use everyday to clean my face, throat, neck and chest area.  It leaves my skin soft and smooth.  I will use this product forever.  I will recommend this to my friends and relatives. This product is one of the best I've found (among other Aveeno skin products) for improving the quality of my skin, evening out the texture and tone, helping control breakouts, and making it nice and soft. One of my favorite cleansers.  Doesn't dry out my skin and does seem to improve my skin texture.  Also seems to mildly lighten dark spots. I am an avid fan of Aveeno skin car products and shampoos... This is non drying gentle cleanser. I like this product. I have used it before in the past. A great price for a favorite of mine. This product is great The best cleanser I've found yet. Smells great and verygentle. Goes on nice & gets makeup off well & yet doesn't leave my face feeling dried out.  By far the best facial cleanser I have used! Love aveeno products! Wonderful product and packed very securely. Gentle, doesn't irritate my sensitive skin.  No overwhelming perfumes.  I like how well it cleans and, the price is right . Wonderful It takes the fatigue look after a long day of work!! I first purchased this last September, just to have something easy to use on vacation.  I couldn't believe how well it removed makeup, especially mascara.  With this Aveeno cleanser, I don't have to use toner anymore.  Put one in your shower and by your sink, so you can use both morning and night. I love all Aveeno products but this is my favorite fash wash. It doesn't feel oily, and I feel clean all day. Love this wash, even my teenager steals it out of my bath to use.  Very gentle on the face, non-drying i like all products of Aveeno brand. Hight quality and geed price as usually. Thank you so so much Aveeno. Love this stuff.  No dry feeling.  Removes all makeup.  Leaves me refreshed and feeling like I'm squeaky clean!  I love all the Aveeno products I use. I've always loved the Aveeno skincare line. I went away from it for a while and used Olay's fresh effects products. I thought they worked for a while but my oily skin only worsened and I began to break out a few weeks ago. I have the same skin care routine every day and it wasn't helping my skin. I started using Aveeno positively radiant and Aveeno clear complexion moisturizer just last week and thus far, my skin has cleared up so much. My skin is not oily at all or shiny and it is so great for sensitive skin. Some people complain about how the formula is ""too soft"" and they don't feel it's cleaning their face. I use a silicone facial scrubber and it works wonders. Hope this review helps! A++ When I was younger, I struggled with acne and would use products that were definitely stronger than this. As I grew older and my acne subsided, I realized that the stronger products were drying my skin out even after a moisturizer was applied. Switching to something softer took some time for my skin to adjust, but this keeps my face very clean and nice. It doesn't stop the occasional hormone or stress induced acne flare, but it keeps my pores and skin relatively clear.I wouldn't recommend it to someone with acne issues, but for the average woman this is a refreshing and effective cleanser.Bonus: it's a cream instead of a foam, I hate the foam. Great! thank you There are tiny beads in this cleanser that help softly scrub your face clean.  I keep one in the shower and one by my sink and use it every day.  It has a very tiny fragrance that just smells nice.It doesn't leave a residue on your skin either.Perfect product.Make sure you get this one and not Aveenos basic cleanser as it won't have the beads.  I made that mistake once. I really enjoy the Aveeno line.  Nice products.  Now if I could just look like Jennifer Aniston (spokesperson for Aveeno if you didn't know.). I know some people say it doesn't lather, but from experience lather doesn't always mean it's working, that can have a lot to do with the hardness of your lather. I love the iridescence (make sure to shake the bottle!!). Not only does the iridescence make me feel fancy and indulge my girlish side, but it really does give my face a nice glow. I first used a natural cleanser by a company called Fresh and it was just way to expensive. This was my economical replacement and it feels just as gentle and soothing on my face. After just one use my skin felt so soft, and even though its natural and gentle it worked magic on removing my mascara. I'll be putting this item on my subscription list. I have never used an Aveeno product that was not good.  This is a nice cleanser that does not dry the skin and does not clog the pores, yet cleans very well.  I am waiting to see if it actually improves the texture/tone of my face, but that may be asking too much.  I would love if my face looked clearer of age spots, etc.  And maybe it will.  As it is, my face looks better and that is all I might hope for. This is the only facial cleanser I've used that cleans my skin without stripping it of all healthy oils. I have combination skin and had a hard time getting rid of a few breakouts that seemed to never go away on my chin. This did the trick. It smells good, has a light lather, and rinses clean. My face feels so good every time I use it! I originally purchased this after getting a Clarisonic. The face wash that came with it was great, but a little pricy, and everyone recommended Philosophy... but it was also too expensive.I knew I wanted a gel based cleanser and Aveeno is usually great on my very moody skin. This was perfect! It's hard to tell by the packaging, but yes, it is a gel.I have combination skin and this has really helped even everything out. My redness is gone (also with help from the Clarisonic). It's consistency and the way my skin feels immediately after rinsing are really similar to the expensive, department store brands.One of my favorite parts: I used this daily and it lasted me for several MONTHS. I couldn't believe it. You really only need one pump, maybe two.It's definitely an inexpensive partner to a Clarisonic system, but an absolutely perfect face wash on it's own. I'm usually not brand loyal in this area, but I won't be trying any others any time soon. Really leaves skin smooth. I receive this product on its scheduled time.  So far so good with this product.  My daughter turned me on to the facial wash.  She has been using aveeno for years... I thought that I would give it a try.  It does not dry my skin out and it leaves no residue as some soap or other facial cleanser does.  I am happy with this. doesn't dry out my face and cleans deeply. always makes my skin feel soft and clean. very happy with this product I love how this feels.  It gives you a feeling that your skin is firmer and glowing.  I won't be using any other product after trying this. I am a big Aveeno fan.  This product arrived quickly, was well packed and in perfect condition.  I use it daily and am extremely pleased with both the price and the product. My package came early and this is a great facial wash,  it doesn't dry out my skin! Will be buying more soon. Aveeno is my go-to skin cleanser for every occasion.  No negatives.  I have recommended to friends and relatives who desire a gentle cleanser. Received as scheduled and is a great product. I bought it to use with my power face scrub brush and it does a great job. Leaves my sensitive skin clean and soft. Great product for older skin. This is the only facewash I use (my skin is very sensitive and reacts to just about anything else). It's very clean without being filmy and has a lovely neutral scent. best ever so gentle keeps skin shinny I'm very happy w/this cleanser! I have sensitive skin & really have to watch what I use. I've done the trial & error method & I'm glad to be done w/that (so is my skin) :) I put my Hempz Original lotion(great stuff) on afterwards & I'm good to go! project arrived on time and as advertised TY Mild and gentle.  You just FEEL clean after you use it - very refreshing and good at getting off light makeup (although I still use an eye-makeup remover along with it).  While it's not over-drying, it's probably not the best choice for someone with extremely dry skin. This product is a perfect addition to my skin care program. It leaves my face feeling clean without drying it out. It's perfect for my needs as a woman with aging skin. As expected This cleanser works magic on my skin. I recently tried the smart essentials scrub when I ran out of my regular scrub and I was amazed at how my skin glowed after the first use. I became obsessed and went and bought a bunch of aveeno products. The positively radiant cleanser being one of them. I use this at night and my skin is so soft after using it. With some cleansers your skin feels right after cleansing and you can't wait to get your cream on. With aveeno my skin never feels tight after using it. Since I switched to all aveeno skincare I haven't gotten any pimples. My skin is even toned and bright and I don't feel the need to cover it with foundation. Seriously my skin looks like I'm wearing tinted moisturizer that's how bright and even my skin tone is. I use this with the positively radiant night cream and my skin looks better than it ever has.  I used to work in a department store selling super expensive skincare and cosmetics. I used to cringe at drugstore brand skincare. My skin never looked this good when I used the expensive stuff. With aveeno I can buy every product I need for less than 100$. I've been telling everyone how great these products are. I hope this line of products never gets discontinued because they're amazing. I used to get so many whiteheads and my skin without make up was pale with red blotchiness. Now my skin is clear and radiant. I wasn't paid to say this. Im not exaggerating. I'm just blown away and had to share. I was only using at night and with the radiance night cream and was very happy with it.  Have switched to using it in the morning followed by daily moisturizer with sunscreen and I am so pleased! My darks spots are lighter and my over all complexion, I feel has improved. I have used this product for years and I love it.  It really does brighten and even my skin tone (I'm 38).  I was pleased to find it here a a reasonable price. I always liked getting new face washes, It was finally time to purchase one. I decided to get this one because ""brightening"" caught my eyes and I definitely have some sun spots from this past summer just chilling on my face. I've always liked Aveeno lotions so I figured I'd give this a try. I was surprised in the instructions it says to shake before use, which I did, but it didn't ""feel"" like anything was shaking in there. I've been using this product for almost a week now and I have to say, its not so bad. It feels gentle on my skin and especially with the fact I have very sensitive skin and acne prone, this truly did not make me feel bad. I had no redness, no allergy, no rash, or irritations. There is a scent to it but its definitely no bouquet of flowers, its light. I love this product! I am noticing that my skin does look brighter and smoother. I am of Indian origin and have oily/combination skin. I have tried neutrgena, oil of olay and proactive. Nothing has done the changes I see when I switched to Aveeno. I decided to go with it because a hispanic friend of mine who has similar skin type showed up one day with this radiant face that I asked her what she did to make her skin so clear and radiant. She told me that all she was using was Aveeno moisturizer and cleanser (positively radiant line). I decided to take her advice and bought all three, cleanser, serum and moisturizer. In just 3 weeks I have had 2 people ask me what I have been doing that my skin looks so ""glowing"". I currently am recommending anyone with combination to oily skin to use Aveeno's line of products. I finally feel content that I have found something that actually feels good after putting it on and really makes a difference. I now love taking care of my skin and dont find it a hassle. I dont have to hunt down ""Fair and lovely"" cream from the Indian store any more.Great product. Only thing is in my area Virginia, I cant find the serum anymore. I have been to target, rite aid and walmart and no one is carrying the serum. I have no idea why they are not carrying it. I bought mine a month ago and now cant find it. So online is where I will have to purchase it.You will not find my reviews this elaborate on any products. I really believe in this product because of the difference I have seen. Love this stuff! Loving this face wash. It leaves my skin silky smooth and my skin does look brighter and more radiant. My skin loves aveeno. Been using for years now and no complaints. Gentle. Cleans face well. Smells good. I love the feel and texture of this product. Makes my skin feel smooth. It is a relatively mild cleanser.  I have been using it for about 6 months now and it has been very reliable.  It is very good for my sensitive, somewhat oily skin.  I have used other products specifically for sensitive skin that did absolutely nothing for my skin. This works much better.  I also love the scent and how shimmery it is out of the bottle. Been using this product for years!!  Terrific for my skin!! I love this cleanser! This is the only cleanser I use to wash my face. I love the radiant line and how it makes my skin soft and glowing. Would recommend combining with witch hazel toner. I had heard that Cetaphil was one of the top recommended facial cleansers by dermatologists because it didn't contain soap and other harsh ingredients.  I never liked it though because it failed to remove all of my makeup and left my face feeling greasy.  So I switched cleansers several times until I found this one.  No soap, gets my makeup off, and smells clean.  What more can you ask for?  It's very gentle too.  I have fairly sensitive skin and whenever I switch products my face always breaks out.  Not this time though.  I think I've finally found my cleanser. :) Been using it for years - glad it hasn't been discontinued. excellent Good. Stopped my ocassional breakouts at age 40, still using it. Great product!!! I have *extremely* sensitive skin and this has been my daily cleanser for years.  Love it.  Hope they never change the formula. If you are looking for a not very expensive and the quality is very good product, then I think this is worth your purchase. I love how beautiful this looks The product meets or exceeds everything in the product description. Five Stars High cost efficient, special design make me love it very much. you won't be disappointed This product is a great value for the money.  It works as well as some of my favorite more expensive brands, like Bliss Fabulous Foaming Face Wash at a much lower price.Because I have sensitive skin that also tends to be acne prone I am very particular about what types of facial cleanser I buy.  This product perfectly fits the bill.  It is oil free and soap free and easily removes my makeup without being harsh and drying.  Best of all, it leaves my skin soft and residue free.  It strikes the perfect balance of keeping my skin supple without aggravating it and causing redness or provoking acne.Those who do not like heavily perfumed cleansing products will also appreciate this facial cleanser.  It has a very light, and neutral scent that is neither floral or medicinal smelling.  Because of its gender neutral scent my boyfriend has also repeatedly purchased it after trying it at my house.I have also tried Aveeno Clear Complexion Foaming Cleanser, 6-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3), but prefer this product.  While the Clear Complexion Foaming cleanser is equally gentle and keeps my acne at bay I find that it is less effective in cleaning away make up.Overall I am quite thrilled with this facial cleanser and plan on continuing to purchase it in the future. smells nice and makes my face feel soft after drying. i also like that one pump is the perfect amount to wash your face. I love it! My face doesn't dry after using and feels smooth after. I've been using this cleanser for years. It takes off all of my makeup, including mascara! That's why I love it so much, one cleansing step that gets all of the makeup off. I use my serum, night cream & eye gel and my nighttime skincare is done.Also, it is the most beautiful glowy liquid. Just very pleasant to use all around. Best face cleaner ever I'm loving this product, I had blotchy skin discoloration, this product is clearing my skin it's been almost a week of usage. You have to try it to see the amazing results, I also use ambi fade cream for acne scars its working amazingly as well. Order this now!!!!!! I searched this on Amazon just so I could leave a review for others, because this inexpensive cleanser blows those expensive sephora brands out of the water!!I LOVE it. It looks like pearls, feels like silk, and has a gentle clean fragrance. I use it once nightly with my Clarisonic and it has improved and transformed my skin. I have combination skin, prone to acne, redness and dryness. I have tried probably 50+ cleansers, philosophy, Neutrogena, cetaphil, Michael Todd, Simple, St. Ives, clean&clear....etc! This is the only one I recommend. It never dries out my skin. I have clearer skin and a more even skin tone. No more redness, and the bottle lasts for months. I typically try new products but I will never stop buying this. Love love love this stuff! I noticed brighter looking skin with in 1 days use. I accidentally ended up leaving it while we went out of town and I couldn't wait to buy another! I needed it now. It makes a difference and doesn't leave your skin shiny or oily. In fact I've had a reduction in blackheads since using this. I've been using it for a month now. This is an affordable face cleanser, which works great! I have sensitive combination skin and this is gentle and effective. I highly recommend it. Something to keep in mind is that a little goes a long way--two pumps are enough for my entire face and neck. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. IT HELPED CLEAR MY ACNE. I AM VERY PLEASED. I use two pumps twice daily and my skin is now super bright and glowing. When you pump it out you can tell that its luminous. Its not harsh on my skin and it has defintely helped my skin clear up. I've used some other cleanser and it made my face feel waxy which I don't like because that means your skin is not breathing.PROS:Lots of product, two pumps twice a day lasted me 3.5 months!Makes your skin bright and luminousGentle on skin and everyday useCONS:None! Aveeno's Positively Radiant has saved my life.  I have rosacea plus oily/sensitive skin.  I have tried prescription washes and so many over the counter for sensitive or oily skin or rosacea I thought I would never find a healthy cleaning regiment till this.I have been using this cleanser for years now.  It is amazing.  It keeps my rosacea to a minimum and totally takes care of my oily skin without overdrying or irritating my sensitive skin.  This product is hypo allergenic and oil/soap free which is what is recommended for anyone with problem skin.This cleanser leaves my face ultra soft and fresh looking.  I highly recommend it to anyone with skin issues.  It is also so much better than the expensive brands you could buy.  The quality for the price is amazing. I can use this to remove my face and eye makeup with no stinging.  This is a big deal as I have sensitive skin. The Purpose and Neutrogena liquid cleansers were too harsh for my fussy skin and since I found this I have been giving it to all my friends to try.  No need to spend big $$ on expensive dept store brands when this works.I use this each morning and evening.  See my other reviews for other products that have worked well for me in my battle to keep my skin calm, soft and clear.  Cetaphil is also a gentle cleanser, but I found it did not remove my makeup. Nice Really like this cleanser! It's gentle enough for everyday use and I see a brighter appearance in my skin just after one use. Definitely give it a try! Leaves my skin smooth, soft, supple, and clean without residue or an overly powerful scent. i just love it... short of words, its amazing in conjunction with the moisturiser. i love it. its just briliant You read it right. I have combination skin, no acne but a weird swollen looking texture issue around the nose and cheeks.  One application, no bs, my skin looked smoother and more radiant. It was the craziest thing. I normally wash my face with water but decided to use it bcuz my face was itching. Needless to say, no more itch and I'm even cuter than I was before. I moistened my face and applied. It didn't have much of a lather. I kept it on my face for 10 mins and washed off. My face was more radiant instantly but the texture thing happened over a couple days. This is my 2nd time using it today, if there's a negative impact, I'll let you know. The best review in comments to give-you must try it for yourself. The only cleanser I will use for my face during the day and at night. Refreshing everything morning! Love this stuff! My 57 year old face feels better already. Pretty sure it's looking better, too. I first used a sample of this cleanser from my dermatologist's office. After using it, I was hooked. My skin tone had been blotchy with uneven skin tone. My skin improved to the point I was willing to go out in public without foundation although still wear foundation for everything other than everyday running around. And it doesn't dry out my dry skin. I ordered 3 bottles elsewhere, could have saved money by purchasing it here. BTW, within the last week, have had 2 people remark that my skin looks like a baby's. Pretty good for an aging baby boomer.Robin Barr, 60 yrs old[...] what an awesome cleanser! gentle yet cleans all make-up. doesn't dry skin + works superb on sensitive, combination skin. floral fragrance is yummy-licious. makes skin care amazingly simple + at a reasonable price too!"
B0027TY3T6," I love it very much.I will buy again in the future. Nice stuff My niece love it I love the scent, and the texture. It doesn't feel super rough but it takes off everything. This is one of the few products that doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. It's also one of cheapest mostly-natural products out there. Say no to parabens! Def scrubs away surface impurities and evens out the skin tone.  My husband says it works for his body acne. Great for exfoliating. Use it 2 - 3 times a week. I love this facewash. I used to use Oxy Face Wash because it was the only thing that really kept my acne away, but the Burt Bees is a great substitution. You don't need much, maybe a quarter (MAYBE) and it leaves your face feeling really clean and really fresh. Bought it for my granddaughter who has begun the acne outbreak.  Many other products she could not use because she would end up with a rash or a red face.  This one works when she remembers to use it everyday. I have adult acne.I dont feel like it's waxy at all. I've used it in shower and just at sink. I think it's a great product and my face has definitely cleared up. I'm on my third bottle of this now. I won't use anything else again. This has helped clear up my skin, wears beautifully under make up and moisturizers very well. Great product that doesn't dry out your skin and has a nice texture to it so it exfoliates. so far so good... Exfoliates without plastic microbeads, adequate acne treatment Great face scrub I LOVE this face wash! It leaves your skin feeling refreshed! Good i love this product very much ill used every day its keeps my face clean & beatifullits the best one ill try Excellent product. I've been looking for something that actually *works* without being too harsh and without causing my skin to dry out. I took a shot with this because nothing seemed to be working and because it's a Burt's Bees' product. Although it's pricey at almost $9 a tube, it lasts a while and it's been very effective. I've been using it for a couple of months now. Often people don't like this because it leaves your skin feeling somewhat oily. I didn't like that at first either. But after sticking with it, it's done a good job of keeping my skin clear and not drying it out as much as other cleansers.See if you like it. Not everyone's the same. Smells delicious, has nice scrubbing action - not too rough. Does a nice job cleaning out my pores. Absolutely loving this product!!! Excellent product I've been putting off leaving a review for this product because I was thinking it might be too good to be true... but after using this over a week I can already say with absolute certainty this is the best face wash I have used. The main reason being it does not dry my face out like almost all other products I have used and it doesn't leave me with that instantly uncomfortable tightening feeling on my face, which has ALWAYS been the biggest issue for me. I was starting to think I would never escape it. Even with face washes that claimed to be for dry skin, it still made it worse after use.I have acne, scars, sensitive skin, dry skin, big pores, pretty much every big issue you can think of that you can have on your face and have been dealing with it since I was a kid and now I am 27 so I have been through a lot of products. I've kind of given up the idea of a magical product that will completely clear up my skin so I mainly focus on just keeping it clean and not drying it out and this is what is working out best for me right now.Everyone is going to have different needs and expectations but if I still highly recommend trying this if you haven't and have similar issues and needs as me. I know I am going to be continuing to use it as long as it keeps working as well as it has been! Very creamy and pleasantly scented. The exfoliating beads were larger and much softer than I expected, which is nice because it felt gentle on my skin. The beads don't feel like they are tearing into my skin, unlike apricot scrubs. There was a residue-like feeling after I dried my face but I believe that was the oils in the cream which kept my skin from feeling very dry and tight. I was pleasantly surprised when I did not feel like I needed to moisturize! My skin feels soft, and un-oily. This will be a perfect exfoliate to use with my weekly glycolic acid peel. Great All Natural product that smells and feels great, and actually works to reduce minor acne problems, however if you are looking for a solution to major acne problems, this is not your solution. You would need to go with something stronger and more medicinal. This is an all natural preventive solution to be used once or twice a day while in the shower. This stuff is really good, and it does help, Come on now it's Burt's Bees! I love Burt's Bees. And adding this to my collection was a good choice. The scrub beads are gentile, they don't scratch my skin or irritate it. I will definitely continue to use it. Leaves your face soft and seems to eliminate pimples. We will see as more time passes. This is an excellent scrub! It seems to refine the surface of the skin, but does not over-clean. If you have ever used an exfoliating cleaner (or any cleanser for that matter) that seems to remove every bit of oil from the surface of your skin, you may have noticed that your skin can sometimes pour out extra oil to compensate. Use it enough, and you'll discover that it can make your breakouts worse because your skin is so irritated. Burt's Bees will leave your skin feeling smoother, softer and most definitely not irritated. Give it a try, and I think you will be very satisfied. Over the last year or so, my acne has changed.  Instead of getting a few large, easily popped pimples that clear up mostly on my cheeks, I seem to have a smattering of very tiny but plentiful pimples across my forehead that are extremely difficult to pop or get rid of.  Any time I squeeze them, they would fill right back up the next day.I've been looking for something that would help right this change back to normal and after using this cleaner for a couple of weeks, I believe this (combined with the spot treatment stick) have done it for me.  I was taken aback at how delicious and natural this product smells.  It is really sweet and nature-y, and a little hard to describe but very good.  (The spot treatment stick, on the other hand, smells exactly like licorice.  Bleh!)I want to say something about the ""greasy"" feeling people have mentioned.  No, it won't leave your skin squeaky clean (or dried out for that matter) like many cleansers do.  This product utilizes jojoba oil which closely mimics the skin's own natural sebum.  THIS IS A GOOD THING!  For me, this was actually a very pleasant surprise.  Your skin won't be dried out after washing and while it may feel weird at first, it is quickly absorbed and you don't peel, itch or flake as a result.  I will leave you with something to think about and research, so keep an open mind when I say this: oil does not cause acne.  One more time, oil does not cause acne.  Dead skin cells and bacteria trapped in the pores cause acne.  I won't spend more time in my review on this, but you can research for yourself.  It is called The Oil Cleansing Method.  Please look it up. 5 stars because it didn't make me break out more and I have really sensitive skin. Also, it didn't dry my skin out and the exfoliation beads feel nice. Can't go wrong with Burt's Bees.  Works as intended Like others, I had been researching alternative facial cleansing products after having used Proactiv for years. Proactiv helped me tremendously during my teens but once I hit my 20's, it stopped working altogether. I began using a natural facial scrub by Desert Essence, along with diluted tea tree oil as a toner. This combination worked for a little while but the acne came back. I ran across Burt's Bees Acne Solutions while perusing at Target, read some reviews before purchasing anything from the line. I finally bought the Pore Refining Scrub as my daily cleanser (gel and cream cleansers don't work on my skin) along with the Toner. I have been using those two products for over a month now and my skin looks fantastic! There was a small initial outbreak once I first started using these but then it quickly went away. Now all that's left on my face are a few acne scars that I cover up with Bare Minerals Bisque Concealer (fabulous, by the way). I would recommend the Burt's Bees cleansing line to absolutely anyone. I wasn't expecting my skin to get completely clear, but man was it a nice surprise! As for just focusing on this scrub, I think it could use more of the scrubbing beads, but maybe that's because I'm just used to thicker scrubs. Someone below me stated that they felt as though this is just a cold cream. No, it is not thick like a cold cream at all. It is easy to spread across the face. Someone also said, maybe the same person, that it is hard to wash off. I don't find it hard to wash off, nor does it leave a film on my skin afterwards. You just need to take extra care in making sure those beads are washed off, as they like to hide along my hair line and in my eye brows. Plus, a nice damp wash cloth does the trick with washing any excess cleanser off of your face. If you're thinking about trying this scrub, or any products from this brand, just do it! You need to give it a month or longer before giving up, as sometimes the skin breaks out when a new cleanser is introduced to it. I bought this from my pharmacy, but it was 99.0% natural, opposed to the 100% natural. I read the reviews on here and was so surprised to see how much hate it's gotten! this has been my holy grail in combination with cetaphil's gentle face cleanser following the burt's bees acne solution. i had very very very bad acne before using this product and now my face has never been clearer!! I strongly recommend people purchase the new formula that is out in stores, MAKE SURE ITS 99.0% NATURAL. I think the ""waxy"" film that people were talking about was because the product was 100% natural. Burts bees fixed this with their new 99.0% natural formula - no waxy film!! great product!! As advertised. My very dry skin loves it, and misses it when I run out! It keeps my skin tone and color even, gets rid of dry patches, doesn't over dry, and smells lovely - light, almost citrusy, not as strong as most Burt's products. I use it every evening, followed by coconut oil. I'm shocked at all the bad reviews because I absolutely LOVE this stuff! This waxy film people speak of did feel a bit waxy, after all, it's Burt's BEES, but to me it wasn't thick or weird, it was nice and smooth and my face is the smoothest it's been in years since using this product! (On second bottle now) I bought it because my 30's have been a blackhead nightmare! Never had bad skin or issues until my 30's..ugh! It's all cleared up and my skin looks really great now.Female age 37 with combination, very sensitive skin and mild Rosacea. I've used various facial scrubs for years since I was twelve, I've tried them ALL. This is the only scrub I've ever come back to! It smells amazing, feels great on the skin, doesn't leave your face dry or feeling like its full of chemicals like some facial scrubs. Pair this with a burts toner and I promise you're going to see some major changes! Okay, here are some facts you will notice after your first use:- Scrubbing particles are too big and not abundant.- After washing off, your face is covered by waxy filmThough I wanted a more exfoliating experience, I think the size of the scrubbing agents is still useful for this purpose, and I do LOVE the waxy film it leaves on my face afterward. I have combination oily skin with a tendency to having breakouts often and this scrub has been working wonders. It does NOT make my face oily, quite the contrary, it's been helping my complexion. My skin looks more radiant and my acne scars are clearing out a bit. I like the fact that I don't have to use a moisturizer after this, but I do like to wash my face thoroughly and using an astringent toner before applying, though that's just me. Give it a try and don't worry about the ""residue"" because it's full of rich emollients that will help your complexion and as long as you're not in really hot weather it'll not make you feel greasy at all. In fact, your skin absorbs it in minutes! Love this stuff. Works well as an exfoliant and hydrates my skin like crazy. I definitely notice my acne diminish when I use this few times a week. I have very sensitive skin and it never effects it. I think the formula has recently been changed, because the bottles now say ""99% natural"" instead of ""100% natural,"" and the scrub no longer has a waxy feel. With the new version, you definitely get that ""squeaky clean"" feeling that everyone likes so much. I think I actually preferred the old version, because it felt a bit gentler and I got used to that waxy after-feel, but the new one's great too. It's still gentle on my skin and seems to help with my mild acne. Great for butt acne! I use this everyday. It doesn't dry my skin and it keeps it clean. Working great for my son's acne...almost completely gone! This is my fourth time ordering this scrub and I love what it does for my skin. I've found that it is gentle enough to use daily and I apply it in the shower after cleansing with my Clarisonic. I would recommend any of the Burt's Bees acne products. love the feeling and it makes me look great .. :)  Nothing like having your face clean before leaving the house. Addicted to this!  Love it and it's cleared up my face and controls oily skin. I bought this product in a pharmacy in the US, used it at home and I must say It is AWESOME!Struggled with red under-skin-pimples, tried Clerasil and all the aggressive facial cleaners but my skin always felt itchy and irritated or dry after using them. This product is different, it gives me the feeling of gently removing old cells and really cleaning the skin without irritating it. Someone here said it leaves a film on your skin. It does, but for me that is a good thing. It helps my skin to ""relax"" and makes it soft and just nice. The fact that it's all organic makes me giving this producs 5 stars.It is just a natural way to clean and prevent your face from getting ugly big pimples again.So, if you have problems with the aggressive clean soaps and creams and whatever they want you to buy out there, try this scrub! :) I have been using this product for three days now, im on my fourth day. I can honestly say the first night that I used it and woke up the next morning I saw a difference. Everyone complains about the waxy layer feel that it leaves behind, I love it, it makes my face feel soo soft and my skin is never dry and it eventually gos away, I mean come on its BURTS BEES, kind of expected if you ask me..Definitely feel like I got my moneys worth and this is the first product ive tried that i can tell a difference, and in the past few months ive tried many different products. It says use it two to three times a week but I use it every night. BUY IT! You wont regret it. Think i'll buy the whole set.. Good product, have used it for a long time. I use this face wash every night in the shower. It does not leave my skin dry. After trying multiple brands that leave my face overly dry or overly oily I discovered Burts bees and it definitely does the job. Soft acne free skin. I absolutely love this face wash.  I used my sisters before buying my own and it cleared my acne up within a couple of nights, better than Cetaphil ever did. Plus this is cruelty free! And it does not dry your skin out. I've used this scrub for almost 3 weeks and I love it. I've integrated the scrub into my nightly routine 3 days out of the week. When I first tried it I noticed the smell wasn't the most pleasant. It doesn't have a horrible smell, I think I'm so used to other companies putting fragrance into their products to make them smell good. The smell reminds me of a natural plant odor. The product does not have a large about of ""scrub balls"", I kind of wished it had more of them. After thoroughly washing my face (I have combo skin) my skin felt healthier and did not get tight (which normally happens after I dry my face). By the third day I noticed some of my pores where smaller then before and my acne prone areas begin to smooth out. I defiantly recommend trying it! I didn't see much change at first like everyone was saying, but I continued using it anyways, two weeks after, I small my pores get smaller and did not break out any more even when I got my period and midterms started! My acne scaring has also faded since using this product! I just bought this product and have only used it once so far, so I can't comment on it's effectiveness in terms of reducing acne, but.....  I do really like it!  I agree with the other reviewer about the thick film it leaves on your face, but I thought it was great because it was very moisturizing and felt great.  My skin felt extremely soft after using this scrub.  If you want a cleanser that leaves your face squeaky clean and dried out, this product is not for you.  If you want a gentle scrub that exfoliates and leaves a nice moisturizing after-effect, you may be happy with this product."
B004CQXYYC," Been using for 20 yrs This is a really good cleanser.  It is the first one that I ever used that felt creamy like a moisturizer.  Goes on thick, but adding water it is creamy and very soothing.  Rinses a little more difficult, but cleans real well.  I notice that some reviewers broke out using this cleanser, perhaps it was that they didn't rinse or wash off their face enough.  I do think it could plug pores if you don't.  Personally though, I liked it and it had a very light pleasant smell. I've been using this for awhile, and really like it. It's the best of the ""sensitive skin"" moderately-priced cleansers I've found, cleans well without drying, and lasts quite a long time.  Initially, I used it either with my hands or a soft washcloth, but recently I've been using it with a Philips skin cleaner with good results.  You don't need to use much at all for it to do its job.I'm older, so need something that is gentle enough but still cleans well. This is it. I've had no problems at all. All good, received in good condition and well-packaged, as anticipated.  Great price also, which was nice.  Will reorder when needed. I have sensitive skin, and I'm one of those people who likes to try new products all the time. But not face cleanser. Every time I've strayed from this I've regretted it. Removes all my makeup easily, doesn't dry or otherwise hurt my skin. I have been using this product for many years, ever since it was suggested to me by a dermatologist MD. I have mature skin that is sensitive to many otc lotions and creams; this product removes my makeup without making my face feel dried out afterwards.  I always follow with a moisturizer. I’ve been using this for MANY years. It removes my makeup with just a light touch/fingers and a light lather. Does not irritate my sensitive, combo skin. Use it every morning and evening to wash my face. It will not dry my face, just leaves a clean feeling. Very nice, inexpensive basic cleanser. Doesn’t dry out skin, I recommend. Does not make face dry with residue.Great price on Amazon. This is just a basic face wash but that's all anyone needs. It takes off my makeup and foams up very well. It's gentle and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin.  Best part is the price! Love this face cleanser.  Olay is always the best ! used this for years.  Would never switch! very foamy and will has worked well. Love this product Cleanses well, removes all makeup without drying out skin. Exceptional value. Love this product. Been using it for a few years. delivered as advertised  easy on the skin and cleans well I have been using this face wash for a couple of years now after trying product after product for my sensitive skin. I was surprised that this worked so much better than all the more expensive wash's out there! I highly recommend it. I really like this product. I love this even though it doesn't foam Great facewash! Removes makeup very well and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. I HAVE USED COUNTLESS BODY WASHES SOME VERY HIGH END,  THIS OLAY SENSITIVE FACE WASH  IS EXCELLENT  FOR A ALTERNATIVE TO THE ACTUAL BODY WASHES.  IT IS VERY GENTLE,  DOES NOT OVER SUDS , RINSES CLEAN , LEAVES SKIN SOFT AND MOISTURIZED.  IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN YOU SHOULD GIVE IT A TRY. I have ultra sensitive (very dry) skin and it's hard to find a cleanser that isn't too oily or too harsh.  Maybe it's psychological, but I like for my cleanser to suds up and this one does the job nicely without drying my skin out.  It works well and has no smell.  I use Oil of Olay body bar to bathe with and it's wonderful. Having sensitive skin and minor skin problems, I've tried various products over the years, I was pleasantly surprised with this product especially because it was inexpensive. A moisturizer is definitely needed as well, but that may be due to the winter season and the harsh water where I live.  I highly recommend this product and will continue to buy it. I've had sensitive skin my whole life and trying to find products that I can use that don't make me break out or get a rash is difficult.  I like that this face wash is very effective (takes off mascara and other makeup without a problem) and it doesn't bother my sensitive skin. Like this product. Use it every day for face. Foams up well, face feels clean and soft.Recommend instead of soap. I love this foaming face wash.  It does everything that it says it will do, and makes my skin feel smooth without burning. I have many issues with my face.  I have oily skin which is at the same time very sensitive.  I also have rosacea so the product I use is very important.  I have gone through many different facial cleansers all promising what I wanted/need but not following through.  Till this one. Olay foaming face wash for sensitive skin is 100 % soap free and oil free as well as allergy and dermatologist tested.  Oil free is very important for skin that is oily and that truly needs a gentle touch.  Many products say they are oil and soap free and then have a minimal amount of the ingredients when you read the label closely.This product has been a Godsend for me.  It cleanses my face fully, removing all oil and dirt leaving it clean and fresh.  It is also sensitive enough for me to wash twice a day which I need to do due the oiliness of my skin.  Now my rosacea is totally under control.  I highly recommend this product and it is an amazing deal here if you lock into the subscribe and save price.  Much cheaper than my local drugstore even when on sale.  If you have sensitive skin or need a clean and pure product I highly recommend this. I've been using this face wash for several years, one of several Olay products I use on a regular basis.  It cleanses well and the pump is so convenient.  Highly recommend for sensitive skin. been using for 20 years. does good job love it so much that I wish I had tried it earlier nice This is the best product for what it is I will order again and again and tell my best friends I have extremely sensitive skin and unable to use soap, so I found this works wonderful on my type of skin. Great price. I have been using Olay Sensitive Foaming Face Wash for several years and don't use anything else to wash my face as my skin is sensitive to most soaps and cleansers.  It leaves my face feeling so clean and fresh and I use it every day. A cleanser is a cleanser, they are all the same...that's what I used to think. I have oily skin, and most facial cleansers for oily skin leave the skin feeling ultra clean, dry and tight, the problem is that that effect makes things worse.So after doing some research I found Olay Sensitive foaming face wash, and it's incredible, excellent product. I've been using it for more than 4 years. A couple of times (because I couldn't find it) I tried other brands with bad results.I highly recommend this cleanser to everybody! My wife has very sensitive skin so she can't use bar soap in the shower.  This foaming face wash is very sensitive. I have used this for years - gentle on my skin and a clean feeling, as opposed to creams I have very dry sensitive skin, I have to use special soap, detergent, etc. I don't have bad acne but breakout a lot with stress. This product is awesome! I usually do a lot of research before I buy a product especially with my sensitive skin, i'm glad I went with this. It isn't really foaming, but it lathers up well with a little water. Takes a little more water to wash off, but helped clear up my skin in a few days! Doesn't dry out either, also good price too with subscribe and save! This is thee best cleanser for acne prone or oily skin types.I started using this cleanser about 5 months ago because of a suggestion from a mod on acne.org. I've been dealing with adult acne for around 6-7 years (I'm 26 Y.O.) and nothing seemed to work for more than a couple of weeks controlling breakouts. I've tried everything from proactiv to clearasil to biore and nothing seemed to do the trick on my hormonal and painful acne until I tried the Olay foaming face wash.The lady on the message board (acne.org) gave the advice that if you want to clear your skin, the cleanser is NOT the step to use benzyl peroxide or salicylic acid because it's literally washed away and down the sink. (Your acne fighters should be used in the lotion.) She recommended the foaming face wash from Olay stating that of all the products she's research (and believe you me she had research A LOT) this cleanser left the least amount on the skin that could potentially cause a breakout.Anyhoo, 5 months later and while I am not 100% clear, my skin is 90% clearer and I am happy with that after the battle I've had with pimples. Gone are the deep hormonal bumps that plagued my chin and jawline - most bumps I get now are small and easily treated with a spot treatment. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product in the pump bottle. :)My routine:*I wash with this face wash most mornings and every night before bed.*I pat my face lightly to dry my skin.*I apply Neutrogena Acne Stress Control Gel Moisturizer - - LOVE THIS STUFF [...]*I spot treat with Burt's Bee's spot treatment using a q-tip - -[...]I hope this helps you! I have been using this product for nearly 30 years; a dermatologist recommended it to me.Not only do I have sensitive skin, but within the last year was diagnosed with Rosacea.  This product thoroughly cleans - removing all traces of both facial and eye makeup beautifully.I've tried numerous high priced facial cleansers formulated for sensitive skin and for Rosacea, but nothing compares to this. Not to mention the price for something that's used daily can't be beat. While I did not purchase this item on Amazon, I just have to leave a review because I was shocked to find the overall rating f four stars.This product delivers it's promise. It's gentle, non-irritating and leaves your skin feeling fresh and clean with a bonus. The bonus is that it leaves your skin moisturized. And, if you appreciate a dewy young skin appearance, you will LOVE this product.  It is perfect for normal to dry skin! If you are the person who needs your skin feeling squeeky clean, this product is not for you. Love this product. I've been using Olay cleansers for years. Keeps my face clean but not oily or drying. I LOVE this face wash. It has no scent, which is great, and it also doesn't have those exfoliating microbeads, which I also like. I don't know if I would agree that it is ""foaming,"" but I like that about it as well - I feel that most foaming washes have the tendency to dry me out, whereas I can use this one twice a day without compromising moisture. I don't have sensitive skin, but I imagine that this would be good for those who do because of the aforementioned lack of scent and drying effect. Also, it's not medicated so you can use whatever other medicated products you want together with it. Perfect for sensitive skin Works perfectly for my skin! Great face wash.  I have used this product and Neutrogena face wash and find that this product seems to produce a thicker foam and I feel fresher after using this soap.  That being said, I'm a man that doesn't use any type of makeup or product on my face other than aftershave.  As I get older I'm finding that I need to take better care of myself.Highly recommended This is a great facial wash. The smell is nature as it doesn't have strong perfume. I hate perfume so this is the perfect product for me. Highly recommended. The price is very reasonable if you wait for the discount. I got pack of 2 for less than 4$. this face wash is perfect! i work at a fast food restarunt so my face gets really oily and breaks out and this product cleared that up in days. i also had dry skin in patches on my face and it made my skin smooth and refreshed! for such a low price this product deffinetly works Item is great. Thank you! This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described. I am very happy with my purchase. I was happy to see this cleanser for a reasonable price.  I works great & makes my face feel fresh."
B01MXFI5TD," Love it! Great It is  a great product for sensitive skin Lasts awhile, great product for image lovers My favorite facial cleanser! I love this cleanser. I've been using it for about 4 years. It does what it says- balances. My skin is so clean after washing and it isn't left dry or oily. As with all cleansers, if you wash your face twice after you've had makeup on then you will get the best clean face ever! Add a sonicare brush to your regime and perfection! Excellent product. Will buy again. The Ormedic Facial Cleanser is wonderful!!!!! Hopefully more women and men will discover what a wonderful product this is for your skin. This product is very mild for my sensitive skin.  This large pump works great for the shower. Love this product for younger and mature skin!! This is the best and most genital product I have ever used on my skin, I have very sensitive skin and this product does not dry my skin out! Great product. Gentle on skin. Leaves it feeling clean and soft. I love this cleanser. Awesome. My wife lovesmthis product. Super good cleanser for my combination skin, but too harsh for my DIL's more sensitive skin. This is the only cleanser I will use. Keeps skin clean and hydrated. I love this cleanser!!! My face was super oily from using proactive and this cleanser helped balance out my ph. Because of that my skin is nornam instead of oily!! Also, it's a great makeup remover, cuts through my makeup so easily!! This is a great product Love this cleanser - it leaves my face feeling clean and free from any residue. It may be pricey, but a little bit goes a long way, I only use a pump the size of a popcorn kernel and it provides enough lather for my entire face and neck. It has a good scent and has made a huge difference in my complexion"
B00FJ2LU2Q," My favorite foam cleanser.  I would recommend getting the oil cleanser as well. Go to - new staple!!!It's a must have for all skin types & way better quality product than the expensive department store brands. It doesn't irritate your skin but you can tell it's working - you feel and see a big difference after 1st use. I was introduced to the product from the beauty gurus at Beauty.9DYNASTYINC.Co and skeptical at 1st to try but for the price and I trust their opinion because their team is diverse of beauties with all type of beauty knowledge! Overall I must say I'm very pleased and will be purchase regularly! Also a little goes a long way so you really get your monies worth!!! Love this Rice water cleanser! Leaves my skin extra soft and smooth! Skin looks immaculate and brighter with just one use! I received free samples with this order too! Thank you! I LOVE ITTTTTTTTTThe shipping is so fast. I love the product since it is quite cheap but serve the purpose greatly.I love the smell so much. I feel like awake and fresh everytime I used it. However, I like the old version more cuz the new version seems too ""light"" for me. The cream isn't thick so it doesn't absorb on skin longer than the old one. Still I totally recommend it!!This is already my second time using this product, so I may tried other ones. So far I love this. Hopefully my results continue and if they don't I will update. I have used this twice so far already with a noticeable difference. I generally have good skin but lately I have been noticing irritation and dry patches with my face washes (Ive used a few different ones). I used this once and my skin was not red at all after rinsing which it usually is, and even my small pimple spots were smooth and lighter. This is NOT whitening (thank god) but it's definitely brightening. My skin seems very happy with this product and I hope it continues. I am considering buyng the rest of the rice water line from this seller. I have oily skin and this cleanser just makes my face feel so clean and happy. ~^^~ I can't say if it's drying or not since I tend to follow up with other skincare products, but my skin has definitely been brightening and clearing up. Also, a little goes a long way with this cleanser (at least for me) and it has a light scent that I just love and a pearly sheen that's so pretty. Before I use this foaming cleanser, I use the Rice Water Oil Cleanser that's paired with it and the combo easily removes any makeup I wear. I love this face wash and am a loyal customer. I am an Asian woman and this formula works very well with my skin type which changes from dry in the winter to oily in the summer - this is a one size fits all cream cleanser. I work the cream into a lather and use a facial silicon scrub to work it into my skin. I pair it with the same makeup remover (same brand) when I have heavy eye makeup on. The best I've ever used and is very very affordable. So far, I really enjoy this product. I have dry combo skin. Pretty normal everywhere but my nose can get pretty oily. This cleanser doesn't foam as much as some so it's a cream hybrid. The clinque cleanser with the same texture leaves my skin sooooo dry and thirsty compared to this miracle in a bottle. It's super light, gentle and smells great. If you have dry or sensitive skin you're going to like it. Leaves my skin super smooth and comfortable. Probably not best for oily skin. I think this maybe my favorite cleaner to date. There was little to no foam as I thought it would be, but then again I only used a pea sized amount each time, which is enough for my face. I have really oily skin on my forehead and nose and this cleaner work well in getting rid of them as my face feel squeaky clean after washing the product off. It gives my face a bit of a brightening effect too and I noticed that my face is less prone to break into acne after several weeks of using this product. Smells wonderful. A light fresh scent. Makes my skin super soft. I just ordered my second tube/ you need very little as it is quite concentrated. Love it❤️ I love this.  This cleanser works really well.  Use just a tiny bit because it really foams up. My face feels squeaky clean after using this.  I'm hooked. I have super dry skin and this didn't dry my face out. Love I absolutely love this face wash. I got it as a sample after purchasing a previous Korean beauty product and I had to get the full size right away. Immediately after using this I could already tell there was a difference --  my skin was softer, brighter, and most of the small bumps on my face were minimized. I use this everyday and I even bought one for my friend who struggles with acne because it's that great. Great price and is a great product.  You don't have to use but a smidgin' and it suds up and rinses clean without drying out skin. It will dry out your skin. You will need to put moisturizer on immediately afterwards. You only need a little bit. It is a great preventitive care and toner. I love this as a toner more than anything else, my dark circles have diminished, my uneven skin tone around my scars and acne have improved and my skin feels clean afterwards. I just tried this cleanser when I was looking for a new foaming one, and I love it!  Cleans very nicely, without overdrying. I bought this product as an experiment but I love it.  It cleans well, has a pleasant light scent and leave your face moisturized.  One of my new favorites. This stuff is amazing it's the only product that can take all of my makeup off and not leave any behind. My skin has never felt so soft and been so clear and I have cystic acne that couldn't even be cleared with accurate so there's literally magic in this bottle I LOVE this stuff and will continue to buy it for the rest of my life . I have Very sensitive skin. This product is absolutely wonderful for my skin. It does Not ""dry out"" my skin at all. In fact, it makes my face feel very clean and refreshed. I use it twice and sometimes three times day - depending on the weather. Truly a great product! This product is good, though I find that it leaves my face a little dry after use. I have noticed it clears away any pimples quickly, which is nice. I don't use it daily, due to it trying out my skin, but it does leave my face feeling very clean. Love this! Smells wonderfully lightly scented! Lots of nice rich thick lather! Great product for mature skin This is great. Smells awesome. Took my make up right off and made my face feel great. I will buy it again. A little goes a long way. You only need a pea-size amount as it turns frothy and lathers when you rub your hands together. I have sensitive skin and this was very gentle and effective. I'm prone to breakouts but after using this Rice Water Cleanser, I haven't broke out since. Knock on wood! Best cleanser I've ever used. I used to only use exfoliating scrubs as a daily cleanser until I realized how harsh and drying that was on my skin. This rice water cleanser does the same cleaning job, leaving my skin silky smooth after each wash without making it feel super dry. After removing my makeup, I use this together with a charcoal konjac sponge and I get a a nice light clean and exfoliation. My skin always feels amazing and is prepped for toners and serums. Love it! Has brighten my face very well. My face doesn't look as dull anymore. When I'm lazy, it cleans off my makeup pretty well too. This product really leaves the face smooth after use, baby soft. Plus the smell is really amazing. At first it was a bit overwhelming, but over time you kind of get used to it. IT's not a bad smell per say, but it is slightly strong and the smell does stay on for a little bit. Has a very faint, nice scent, not overly perfume-y. Doesn't dry my skin out too bad, although if you don't use a moisturizer this might be a little harsh. Keeps my skin very clean and I've noticed a decrease in pore size. Love it. Love this!!! I have combination oily and dry skin I am also black with darker skin complexion. I love how it cleans my skin and gets rid of any pimples that feel like they are about to come up!! I also use at the moment 7 step facial routine. Check out my channel for more A Peared Girls Guide. My daughter got rid of her acne with this cleaner some years back. I recommend it everytime to anyone who asks how she did it or asks how she keeps her skin looking so nice. She uses it religiously when she wakes and before bedtime after removing her make up. Her skin is flawless and the color is not just white, it's bright. I order two this time, for myself to brighten my skin and the other is for my neighbor who is getting adult acne. I like this a lot and a little goes a long way.  I use with my Clarisonic.  Great results. Amazing! Love the slight flowery smell, and love how luxurious the foaming is! All other foaming cleansers I have tried were super drying, this did not make my face feel tight after cleansing. Cleans all oil and dirt off properly; if used after a cleansing oil. Tube is good amount for price and you only need a pea sized amount. I have oily skin and i absolutely love this product. It keeps my skin dry and moisturized at the same time. Use it twice a day and you will see immediate results, but of course, its different for everyone. For those who have dry skin, i do recommend you to use a little bit of moisturizer after using this cleanser because i leaves your skin a bit dry after. A little goes a long way, this product is a bit thick, almost like a cream so i can definitely last you a while. One of my favorite cleansers! Gentle cleansing and doesn't leave skin feeling tight and dry. The Cleansing oil that matches this product works well with it. Scent is light and not too overpowering. Love this cleanser! It isn't drying or too creamy. Lathers well ,cleans well and rinses off completely.  Couldn't be happier! Doesn't irritate my sensitive skin either. This product truly does brighten your skin (even on darker skin complexion)  and help get rid of most of the dirt from my face. This product really amazed me because I was worried that wouldn't work with my dark skin tone  but it does . Another thing what I like most about this product is that a little of it could go along way which means that you don't  have to use a large amount for it to work ( super soapy) and very gentle on my sensitive skin. I highly recommend this  anyone !! I love the smell of this cleanser. I also love hoe creamy it is and it leaves your skin so soft. This is the best facial cleanser I have ever used! I use it daily as part of my nightly routine. I will never use anything else. My skin has never been so soft/clear/bright and blemish free. I definitely recommend this face wash!! I had acne for several years very bad on my chin. Since I started using this I saw my acne disappear. It took about a month of daily use but it's truly disappeared! I use this along side several other Korean products and I'm so happy :-) This cleanser has really helped clear my skin. I use it in combination with the rice water cleanser and the moisturizing toner. I love that it’s not over-drying, makes my skin feel great, and it’s AFFORDABLE. Love! I liked using this product but my face is too sensitive. My boyfriend has since taken over. Good cleanser! I had acne and acne scars on my whole cheeks. I used Proactiv plus kit but it didn't help much. So many hours of searching, I found this product and wanted to try it out. My skin got better within a month. All the acne scars disappeared as well. This cleanser makes my face glow. The only down side about this product is that it dries out my skin a bit. This cleanser gets a bad rap from some of the Asian beauty forums and blogs that I love because it has a higher PH. But honestly it has performed stellar for me so I'm going to keep buying it. I double cleanse using the matching cleansing oil at night and just use the foaming cleanser in the morning. It can be a bit drying in the winter months but perfect for normal to slightly oily skin. My face feels smooth, clean, and not super dried out after using this! I love it a ton. My skin can be sensitive, and this cleansing foam really does the trick. I am so glad I decided to order this face wash.  It smells sooooo good and makes my skin feel softer than any face wash I've used before.  It's a perfect second cleanser after I oil cleanse with argan oil and remove my makeup.  For the last few weeks I have had the most horrendous (possibly hormonal) breakout of my life and after using this for a few days, the big painful pimples I've been getting have been drying out and shrinking already.  I love it, can't wait to see how my face looks in a few weeks! I just received this and I'm so excited!  I'm a little late on the Korean beauty/skin care trend but better late than never!  After just one use, my skin feels tighter and squeaky clean.  It does sting a little if it gets in your eyes, so keep your eyes closed tight and a towel near by!  Very happy w/ my purchase.  BTW-  I'm 36 with occasional eczema, especially when I was younger. Too drying for me. Would be good for oily skin. Oooo I love this cleansing foam! Great scent and a small amount is all you need. I rub it between my palms, and then run my hands under water. I apply it on dry skin. I've already washed off my makeup with The Face Shop Rice Water Bright Cleansing Oil, so no need to wet my face. I use a circulating motion around my face for about a minute, and then wash it off. Wonderful product that doesn't cause my skin to break out. I'm going to order more! Beautiful. Outstanding.This cleanser foams up nicely, unlike any other wash I've used (I'm thinking it has to do with the rice water). And the scent is calming and has a floral touch, it's a nice touch. After patting my face dry I instantly knew I wouldn't be needing moisturizer. It left my face feeling soft, supple, refreshed, and pure. foamy and removes make up well. smells amazballs and leaves the face very nice and clean It really does leave your face super soft!! A little goes a long way.  I used too much the first time, i think a nickel size squeeze will be enough.  At first as i was cleaning my face i wasn't sure about the product but then after i dried my face i could feel how much better my skin felt. It did not break me out, i have combo to normal skin.  This is a great buy for the price! always my wife's favorite. I love this cleanser. It makes my face very soft after washing and smells very nice! I recommend!! This face wash is amazing! I have already noticed after a week of using it that my skin is clearer and brighter the pores are visibly smaller. Creamy gentle cleanser! I love this facial wash! I have never used a facial wash besides regular bar soap, but after reading the reviews I decided to try it. My face has never felt so smooth and fresh. You don't have to use but a tiny amount. It goes a long way. I highly recommend it. Anything The Face Shop is a great buy, this can be drying if your NOT following a 10 step routine, because you regain your moisture in the other steps of the process. With a regiment, this is a perfect addition! I adore this cleanser. It's very gentle on your skin and a little goes a long way. I've been using this cleanser for exactly 2 months and it has evened my tone and reduced the occurrence of blemishes drastically. You won't regret this buy. Like it！I have bought about 4 bottles^o^ I actually enjoy the smell of it and although it doesnt really foam up too much, I feel my skin is really clean and not dried out after using it. Creamy gentle cleanser.  I use a lot of masks and products to combat my oily skin and trying to avoid getting wrinkles.  This is a nice gentle break from any harsh products I put on my skin!  Doesn't over dry my skin even when I over wash due to workouts/etc.  Would recommend for a gentle, good smelling face wash. Excellent Love this foam flenser. I've had it for over a year now (I got it in February of 2016). A little dollop goes a long way. I'm definitely ordering this again since I'm close to running out now. I use it in a regimen tho so this is not the only product I use. Love this so far!  A little goes a long way!  Serious, a tiny dot of this will foam up very quickly into a nice rich lather! Best brightening face wash. Very rich lather. Will purchase again. Can't beat the price but towards the end of the bottle my face was getting dry and so I took a break from it for a while but it could have been the weather. I saw major improvements in my skin after using this - radiant and glowy skin!!!! I love this product.  It goes on light and gets rid of my make up and oils very effectively without leaving my skin feeling dry.  I have fairly sensitive skin and am very picky with what kind of product I use on my skin and this product was such a good buy and great price.  I would definitely purchase this product again.  You do not have to use a lot at a time.  Great results, great quantity for the cost. Great product! The first time I used this it immediately became my favorite face wash. Only a little is needed, it smells great, and my skin feels so clean afterwards. I have normal to combination skin and this does not dry it out. I also find I don't need as much moisturizer. I hope Amazon never stops selling it because I will continue to purchase this! I love love did I say LOVE this cleanser, I don't wear heavy makeup but I do wear water proof sunscreen so I don't wash it all out at the end of the day and this does the job. it foams and thoroughly cleanses without leaving you dry. it is compatible to a high end cleansers, gets this for your self, it's amazing. I'm about halfway through the bottle and I love this face wash! It gets my face super clean. When using a toner afterwards, the cotton pad comes away clean. I have combination skin and this doesn't dry my skin out. My face has been clearing up. The frangrance is discreet, but nice. Will definitely purchase again. This product works very well for me.  It leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed.  The smell is nice too. My skin has a tendency to be oily and sensitive so i have a hard time finding a good cleanser. This made my face feel actually clean without drying it out. A little bit really does go a long way too. It foams up beautifully. Shipping was super fast. Got it 4 days after ordering. Very happy with the product and the seller. I have been using this facial cleanser for a while. It can be a tad drying but it is good at removing makeup and is overall a good cleanser. It kind of reminds me of nexema in consistency. Amazing soft cleanser product. I can use it everyday I use this daily and nightly. Just a tiny bit will do - it suds up VERY WELL and cleans great. I really love this cleanser. I use it with my clarasonic to wash my face at night (after I have removed my makeup with a makeup remover wipe, I like the ones from Costco). This cleanser foams up nicely, has  a subtle scent, and does a good job removing my makeup. It also doesn't over dry my face. Plus, the tub is pretty large so this will probably last a while. I noticed my face feeling smoother after the first wash. I use my acne wash first then use this Bc it's so gentle on my just-tough-washed face that needs a bit more tlc. I love this ricewater wash and it's pretty big so it shouldn't run out too quick. It smells just as it's named. After having the product for about a month now, it is time for me to review it. The foam is very smooth, and the smell is not strong either. After using it, my skin would feel very smooth and it seems as though my skin brightened, not whitened. I was afraid that I would break out after using the product, but that wasn't the case. OMG I LOVE THIS. I had bought this other green tea cleansing foam too, but it stinged my face because it was NOT for combination or dry skin, which I didn't know until I tried it out. BUT THIS FOAM IS PERFECT FOR COMBINATION AND DRY SKIN!!  It makes my face soft, and feels squeaky clean. I apply some moisturizer after I've washed with this. Love it. I got this cleanser last month and I really like the smooth foam and flowery scent of this cleanser. It doesn't dry my face after use and my face seems whiter than before which must be from the rice water. I was not a big fan of face shop product before, but after this cleanser I think I will try some other faceshop skincare. I use this cleanser every day along with the cleansing oil and eye make up remover.  All three work very well for me (50 y/o female with sensitive skin living in Las Vegas heat and dryness).  Faint smell and rinses clean.  Leaves skin moist and refreshed.  I seem to 'glow' after I use it.  And a lot of people have noticed I look 'refreshed'.  Hummmmmmm, that's a plus!!!!!Fast shipping and packaged well..... I ordered this item from the seller JOLSE, who I would first off highly recommend (it arrived earlier than expected and came with awesome free samples). The cleansing foam is wonderful. It's left my face nice and smooth, and is the perfect follow up from The Face Shop Rice Water cleansing oil. Now that I use it, I can't be without it! Will definitely purchase again! What a great cleanser! It's got a pearly sheen to it and a generic soap smell. It does a good job of cleaning and leaves your face super smooth. My face tends to get very oily and I noticed I'm not so oily since I started using this product. I'll definitely be buying more of this. I absolutely love this foaming cleanser. Not only does it not strip your skin of the natural oils but it leaves the skin moisturized. I use it daily in as part of my nightly skin care routine. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone and everyone. It is very reasonable priced and works just as great- if not better- than the high end cleansers that I have used. i love korean products in general, but this makes my skin feel like a baby's bottom! soooo soft! i love this so much! would recommend to anybody! This is an amazing cleanser, I love the scent and it's done wonders for my skin. I have combination skin and it's helped control the oily areas without drying out the rest of my face! I haven't had a real breakout since I started using this and that's all I can really ask for at the end of the day. It does leave some residue (which I assume is the stuff that gives it an iridescent tint) but I use a sponge to rinse my face and it wipes off anything that the soap leaves behind. Its gentle and won't strip your face! Perfect! You only need a small amount and it lathers very well. I also received the product much sooner than expected. I absolutely love this product.  It foams enough, not too heavy not too light.  The scent is very subtle but quite pleasant...not too strong and it has a dream scent...if that makes any sense.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  I used to buy this at the Face Shop but it's double the price so I've started to order it.  I am most likely to order multiples. Absolutely love this! I gave up on trying to use any face cleanser until I came across this. It was cheap enough so I gave it a shot. I'M SO GLAD I DID! This is such a wonderful cleanser for you skin. My complexion is a bit oily and this cleanser doesn't strip it that my skin becomes dry. it's is a superb product. A keeper.  I'm a African American women, so that may help This is amazing. It's creamy, foams without foaming.....don't ask me to explain, it just does. No matter how little I use there's always enough and end up using for neck, chest and beyond. It leaves skin clean but not dry or tight. It's a nice background for toner and essence. BEEN USING IT FOR ALMOST 6 MONTHS, AND LOVING IT. I LOVE THE SMELL, AND ALSO THE SIZE IS PRETTY BIG. Wonderful cleanser! A little really goes a long way. Just pea sized cream can already produce a complete lather over my face, and leaving it fresh and very cleaned without drying out my skin. And yes, it does an excellent job not only at removing my make-up, but also my dead skin. Love it! I love how this face wash doesn't dry out my skin. It makes my skin very soft . I've been going through a lot of hormonal changes after having my baby and nursing , shop my skin has been out of whack. With pimples on my chin and forehead. This face wash has made a noticeable difference on my face. My favorite cleanser! Nice creamy application that washes off with ease. I have an oily complexion. Leaves my face feeling squeaky clean, yet not dried out. Instead it left my face feeling nice and soft.  Will keep on buying. I used this product only 2days my acne seem better and smooth cheek I love it 😍 You only need a tiny bit, which is great and this will last a long time The skin on my face feels so soft after using this. If I can give it 10 stars I would. I wear makeup everyday and I don't think in all my years have I ever purchased a product this amazing. I love, love, love this product. I know once I wash my face with this it will be soft and makeup free. His product brightens your skin, it can also dry your skin if you wash your face too much, i suggest if anyone wants to use this just use it 2 time a day.The foaming effect really is a great idea, you only need a little, this bottle could last you 3 months or so, this product is amazing.... Really clearing up my acne, and does a fairly good job with acne scars as well. THIS IS MY MOST FAVOURITE CLEANSER OF ALL!!!! It is light on the skin and foams up well. The scent is light and pleasant. It leaves my face feeling super clean and refreshed, but also moisturized( but you do have to moisturize afterwards.) I can't wait to use mine up and purchase some more. I'm thinking of buying some more just for my friends and family. I highly reccommend this! Yay got it yesterday and tried it for the first time and I can already see a big difference that my acne scars are disappearing. 😍😍😍 Good Think i love the scent. One of the first evening steps of my beauty routine, to cleanse your face without stripping it of moisture. This products is a crucial part of my routine, and lathers richly and smoothly with a lovely scent.Remember, your basic beauty routine should consist of approximately 5 - 10 steps;1. Makeup Removal (typically an oil)2. Facial Cleanse/Wash & Lip Scrub, to remove dead skin, buildup of oil, and any remaining makeup residue3. Toner, to rebalance and reintroduce moisture to your washed face4. Emulsion, to add more hydration to your balanced face5. Serum, to add special nourishment/anti-aging to your hydrated face6. Cream, to lock in everything7. Facial SPF, to protect (Day) or Night Pack (Night)8. Eye cream (Day formula is typically SPF, or Hydrating Night Eye Area Pack for night), to hydrate and/or protect the sensitive eye area9. Lip Pack (Day formula is typically SPF, or Hydrating Night Lip Pack for night), to keep exfoliated lips hydrated and protected thought the day or nightOptional additions include facial masks once or twice weekly and facial mists to keep a hydrated face throughout the day. There are certainly other additions to any routine, but what I've personally listed and numbered are what I find cover the basic length of a typical, daily and nightly Korean facial routine.As always, good luck and I wish you clear skin! I was hesitant to purchase this product but I am glad I did. It lathers up so creamy on your face. I love the fragrance too. It is comparable to Origins Checks and Balances except it isn't all natural. Will order again. Awesome product and great quality! Shipping took two weeks (as expected) and it was well wrapped and sealed. It was even bigger than I though it would be! And it came with a nice little moisturizer sample :) Good value. Works well and does not dry out face much. I have found my face wash 😍😍 This Is perfect  for my dry skin. It is very moisturizing. Feels very gentle on my skin and i have no allergic reactions whatsoever. I love the face shop and looking forward to order more products from them and from this seller too. It came fast. after one day of use, I already can see that my skin is clearer and brighter This cleanser makes me really enjoy washing my face. The cleanser itself is very luminous and feels velvet in my hands. It foams up really well and leaves my face feeling really soft but thoroughly cleaned. If you have dull skin or wish it just had a bit more life, this is the product for you. LOVE this foaming cleanser. It is gentle enough on my skin and works very well with the Banila & Co oil cleanser that I use before applying this product. I highly recommend this as a foaming cleanser. I am pleasantly surprised with this cleanser. It leaves my skin smooth and fresh, without drying out my face. The product is creamy and foams up beautifully, so a little goes a long way. It also helps removes any stubborn makeup residue. I definitely recommend this product. Loving this so far. I Use it after the light cleansing oil that helps remove dirt, oil and makeup from the day. Then I follow up with this foaming cleaner and my face feels so fresh, clean and little more radiant. I have sensitive skin and this doesn't irritate it at all. Has a light scent. I have tried many, many cleansers out there, but I have purchased this one three times.  I'm a skincare product junkie and I LOVE to try new things, but I always come back to this one.  It's so gentle on your skin and you feel very clean (and with all the other serums and stuff I use, I think I really need my cleanser to be the gentle). I have purchased this three times. AND for make up removing or double-cleansing days, I love the oil from the same company. My husband has even more sensitive skin than I do and I started encouraging him to use this cleanser, too.  He likes it, so it looks like I'll have to be doubling up my orders from now on! I love this stuff. Had never tried mousse before and it feels so luxurious. Highly recommend Smells fantastic and works beautifully.  I look forward to using this product morning/night!  Wonderful. Okay Korea has officially won the facewash game.. I was introduced to this cleanser and others from The Face Shop by my Korean friend who has the most flawless skin. I would joke with her about how high maintenance she was that she would order her facewash all the way from Korea, but after she had me try this, let me just say nobody's joking anymore! **The first few times I ordered this shipping took several weeks since I think it was coming from Korea, but that doesn't seem to be an issue any more (esp. because it's now on Prime)**Moving on.. I've used almost everything sold in drug stores to keep my acne in check, and while I'm not sure a ""silver bullet"" cleanser truly exists, this is probably the closest I've gotten to one. With so many things on the market, it's hard to pinpoint exactly what it is about this stuff that makes it special, but my face just feels so clean after I use it. It's somehow able to draw out all the excess oil without over-drying (though I do usually apply a generic face moisturizer after cleansing). I have yet to be disappointed by a cleanser from The Face Shop, but this one is probably my favorite. TRY IT! You'll thank yourself later.. gentle cleansing, like it very much .. also I noticed some whitening effect It's a simple face wash.  I don't know that it adds anything special to the way my skin appears, but. . . the packaging is super adorable ^-^ Have been looking for a good but not too expensive face cleanser and I love this product! Plus I love the lite fragrance. I have used other relatively good cleansers but hated the way they smelt. This one has a mild but excellent smell. This facial wash is amazing. I have combination skin (oily/dry) and it works perfectly for me. I feel like it cleans well but also leaves my face well moisturized. Highly recommended! i love this stuff. I am really picky about my face wash. I find most products dry me out and then my face creates more oil when I wake up, but not this product. It's pretty awesome. I hope they never stop making it. love this. smell so good! the best Korean cleanser I have tried so far! Feels very clean without drying. I like the mild scent too! This is amazing. The first product cleanser I have ever used for my face and it is extremely soft. I love it and I would buy it again. I don't have much ancestors and I did break out because my skin wasn't used to it but I love it. really liked this face wash! usually face washes don’t alter my skin but this one i swear makes my face look more glowy! i will be repurchasing once mine runs out! Very nice touch to my desk. Perfect foam for me. I like even the smell of it, and its consistency is great and the little bit goes a long way. Excellent product -- and I use it with facial Konjac sponge, and it cleans and brightens my face beautifully. Works great, it really did help brighten my acne scars. It's a bit drying though,so I think this would be great for oily skin. Great cleanser and nice scent. As I age out of effortless beauty (I'm 28 now), I get more and more dedicated to skincare and while I have a pretty effective routine, I'm occasionally moved to try something new on a strong recommendation. People have been raving about Korean skincare products forever and this was one of my first of such purchases.This cleanser is lit. I use it every evening after softening my pores with warm water. Just a pea-sized amount lathers up with my little silicone exfoliating pad Konjac Sponge 3 Pack and Silicone Brush By Partie Naturals Activated Charcoal - Facial Sponge, 100% Natural Sponge Suction Hook Included and works to thoroughly cleanse my skin without stripping it. while I won't use it every night forever (I want to stay brown), it's already doing wonder for some hyper-pigmentation I have from scarring.After less than 2 weeks of regular use my skin is looking clearer and, frankly, more impressive. I follow up the cleanser with my usual nighttime routine of a my current favorite serum InstaNatural Vitamin C Skin Clearing Serum - Anti Aging Formula with Retinol & Hyaluronic Acid - Natural & Organic Wrinkle, Acne, Dark Spot, Fine Line & Hyperpigmentation Defying Facial Product - 1 OZ and moisturizer Radha Beauty Rosehip Oil 4 oz - 100% Pure Cold Pressed Certified Organic . Decent smell brightened skin I love the way my face feels after I use this product on it.  I don't think my face has ever felt cleaner or softer.  I will definitely keep using this. This is my favorite cleanser. It smells good. It has soft foam. After using this my skin feels cleaned and fresh. It is soft and gets the job done. I use it after the oil from the same brand and line One of the best face washes I have ever used. I have oily skin and this leaves my face feeling fresh. Would totally buy again! I use this at night and it feels so great! A little bit foams up really well. I love foam cleansers so this makes me really happy! The tube is definitely going to last a long time. My face feels very clean and refreshed afterwards but not dry. My mom even tried it and she said she really liked it. The cleanser is quite gentle, which is what I wanted. It doesn't have a particularly strong smell. It leaves my face feeling pretty clean. I'll wait a bit to see how it fares in longer term use. It brightens my skin but you need to moisturizer after. Also,you dont receive samples like someone posted. I love the cleaning foam ,  very useful.  recommend the product. and the foam can be used for a long time. I really don't know what to say other than it is AWESOME! The amount you get takes a while to use up. I literally use just a pea size amount. Perfect for combination or oily skin. Foams really well and is gentle, I use it every day after the oil cleanser and sometimes by itself, and it doesn't dry my skin out. A little goes a long way so one will last a very long time. Love this product! And the best part about it is, I don't even need to put a lot on to make it foam up. It foams very fast and gives you enough of the product on your skin with just a the size of a pea. Great product! Leaves my face feeling soft Amazing Cleansing Foam! Already at my 3rd tub, it cleanses my skin without drying it up. I love the scent and how clean and soft my skin feels after using this. Highly recommended! My face feels super clean without drying or tightness. Nice light scent barely noticeable but somehow very pleasant.  Seller was very thoughtful in how they packaged it up for shipping and sent along some nice samples along with it . I will be repurchasing unless by some miracle I come across  an even nicer cleanser. This is a really great cleanser & such a great value.  Left my face super soft, really like the consistency and love the results! I am going to buy this again because it actually helps my skin and brighten the tone... I have been having troubles with red spots on my face but it calm it down... sometimes I wash my face with rice water. Plus i actually changed all my cleansing product to this brand... I love it. I use this cleanser everyday in the morning and night, leaves face smooth. I think this works best for oily/ combination skin. I love washing my face with the Rice Water Bright Cleansing Foam.  I rarely use cleansers because they dry my face out.  I love how this product makes my face feel.  My complexion is much clearer and brighter. cleans my face very well. It feels fresh and bright. The amount of time delivered to me is much faster than the originally estimated amount of time. I've been using this Product for about 2 weeks now. So far so good. I like that this product is hygenic and is easier to control the amount dispensed each time.The foam is milky white and has a thick consistency. It has a nice subtle smell and I personally love it! It lathers very well thus, a little is enough to cover the entire face. I love it so much because it does not strip off moisture from my face and is quite moisturizing. It makes my skin soft and smooth! It doesn't break me out which normally happens whenever I use a new product! feel that it also tighten my pores, making them look even better after cleansing.I can't believe how good & affordable this is. I will definitely purchase another one once I ran out! I adore this product, it is my Holy Grail cleanser. Cleans off makeup and my skin feels so hydrated and soft,. So thankful I can get The Face Shop products on Amazon. This product is so gentle and cleans very well! It dries out my skin a bit but with a light moisturizer my skin is bright and clear. I will be using this product for as long as they keep making it. Good product. My face has started glowing thanks to using this product. Dr. Oz recommended to get something with rice paste in it, which is why I bought this product. I received my order today and so far I'm really liking it. It lathers well and it doesn't leave my skin feeling too tight or dry. You only need a tiny amount to lather your whole face so I'm happy this will last me a while ^.^ I really like this face wash. I have very sensitive skin that is prone to cystic acne and this stuff has worked well and hasnt irritated it at all. Very refreshing I've been on a total Korean beauty kick lately, and this is my new favorite face wash. It's a thick, lotion-y consistency and a little goes a long way. Smells great, and although it does leave my skin a little dry, the brightening effect is unmistakable. I loved the product so much I really enjoyed it and it got delivered earlier than expected. I really enjoy using this facial cleanser.  I keep it on my face for a few minutes before washing it off to receive the full benefit of its brightening properties.  The price was excellent and delivery was swift as well.  It will brighten your day! My face feels so clean after just the first wash. It's light and suds up really well. My skin's very sensitive and the scent doesn't bother me, nor has it made me break out. We shall see in a few more days! Smells great and it leaves your skin really soft. Make your face very clean, hydrated & soft!  Already ordered 2 more. This is my go-to face cleanser after being a strict Dermalogica fan. This paired with the makeup remover is awesome! Absolutely love this product! After using my cleasing oil, I use this and my face is squeaky clean. I wear alot of makeup bc I cover a birthmark and am very picky about makeup removers and face washes so for me to like it, it has to work well. Made my face feel great. Adore this cleanser. I use it as my second cleansing step after lavo makeup cleansing oil.  It only takes a pea sized amount and gets super foamy. Leaves my face clean soft but not tight and stripped feeling. Lathers up really nicely and cleans skin without drying it out.It brightens the skin as well.. just ordered my second one. not for pimples (coz i still do have break outs - hormonal) but for cleansing, feel so fresh. i like the smell, tbh.Update: arrived way early than what I expected and got freebies! Yaaaas! Love this! Skin texture and tone have improved in just a couple of weeks. I use the cleansing oil as the first step and this cleanser as the second Very good lather, a small pea-sized amount goes a long way.  Light smell.  Rinses off easily and does not dry up skin. I love this face cleanser!! It feels like silk when you apply it and it leaves your face feeling so smooth after you wash. This is my holy grail face wash! I will never use anything else again! I love this face wash so much!! It does a good job removing any left over make-up on my face after using a facial wipe. It leaves my face clean and soft. Love the way this foams and keeps my face feeling moist when washing! really like the creamy texture! Love the feeling of this cleanser when I wash it off my face.

Best facial cleanser I've ever tried. I've used everything from Cera Ve to very high end brands. This one is PERFECT. I like this cleanser a lot better than the one I had been using.  It is a great start to my daily skincare routine and the light scent is nice. Does what it says, it washed of everything on my face, I really like the feeling on my face after washing it. I've only used it for two days but very pleased with this product. Leaves my face fresh and soft. Smells great and a little goes a long way. Its good for my skin during the summer months. And helps with taking off leftover makeup. Love this face wash. It seems to clean well and creates a clear and bright complexion after use. Love this stuff! My face is clear and bright and I haven't found a blackhead since I started using it daily. I absolutely love this product!  My face actually feels clean after using this.  My pores are smaller too!  I like the scent also!! All you need is a pea size amount to wash your face. It cleans well, and it does not dry out my skin like other cleansers. I love it and will continue to use it for a long time. Bought it as a replacement for my other expensive face wash and I noticed I haven't had any breakouts and I was actually complemented for having bright skin. I just love the smell of this product. It cleans my face without leaving it dry. I have recommended this to friends Very creamy texture, and smells amazing. I'm obsessed with the creamy, thick lather of this stuff. Great product, will buy again! second time order it Love the way it cleans Best face wash! I love how clean my face feels after i use it. Feels SQUEAKY CLEAN! Haven't had a break out on it at all!

Made my skin really soft after using this, and it smells great :) Love this product. super soft and smooth texture leave my face so soft and feel so clean. Smell so nice. Highly recommend. 100% changed my skin. ill never use anything else Works just as well as my high end product face washes. Would purchase again. This is a really great cleanser - feels good on the face and rinses off easily. Works nicely. It is a foamy, marshmallow texture. I really like it. Smells good, cleanses decently. My skin loves this stuff! And it smells and feels so good! Makes me face feels sorts and smooth. Smells good too. Makes a very nice foam with a small amount of product.  This tube will last a long time.  Nice subtle scent. All I can say is FOAM, you put just a little on your hand and you have lots of foam, good product Not only do I love how it works but I love that a little goes a long way, literally a lentil sized portion lathers up and does the job. Funny thing, this works better on my skin than other expensive brand cleansers....i guess it's a really good thing! I Love this product. It makes my face feel so soft and clean. nice and soft on the skin I use this to wash my face after I use the cleansing oil of this same brand to take my makeup and sebum off. It works great and smells great. It is very gentle and effective. Leaves skin so soft!!!! In another language but at the bottom has directions in English. Like this stuff. This product leaves my face soft and bright! I only have to use a small amount. I love it! It's not heavy or oily at all. It works and it's so amazing. I love it.It is worth every dollar spent Makes my face so smooth. I recommend Smells so lovely and such a wonderful lather. I can't say anything negative about this face wash. I love it! love it, perfects for my skin. I love using this as a second step in double cleansing! It is smooth and lathers great for a foam cleanser and rids of any oil left from the first step of my double cleansing. It does leave behind a floral/powdery scent, so those who are sensitive to smells may not like this. A little goes a long way with this product because a pea sized amount will cleanse your whole face.Honestly, this cleanser can get a little bit drying, so I wouldn't recommend this to those with dry skin. I have combination skin and it's a little bit drying on my normal areas, but it does such a great job on my oily t-zone. But other than that, this cleanser does it's job. It leaves you with a clean face and brighter looking skin. It's great my face felt smooth and fresh I will buy this product again Gentile enough for sensitive skin. Absolutely no residue, rinses clean. My face is clear and smooth. Love this stuff! My face doesn't feel dry after I used it and I saw results when my acne improved. This and the Rice Cleansing Oil will be my go-to facial cleansers from now on. Very gentle but still gets my makeup off. I have sensitive skin and have had wonderful results with this product. Awesome face wash!! Cleans and brightens your skin without over driying. Helps with acne. I would buy it again Love this face wash! I have oily combo skin and it's not too drying. Love it. I will continue to purchase more. It smells AMAZING!! Leaves face clean. I've owned this product since November 2015. My face feels very clean every time I use this product to clean my face! I feel like it can be helpful in preventing acne, but not quite as effective if you already have acne on your face. I noticed that I don't break out as much, but that can also be due to some products I've been using these past few months. All you need is a little dime sized drop of this product to clean your entire face which is probably why I still have this product after about 7 months! The only thing is that when I use this product, I feel like there's this residue that makes my skin feel different. I'm not sure of how to explain it or if it's even a residue, but my skin just feels different and more smooth, but not in a way my skin usually feels when it's smooth. I don't think this product made a difference in my acne scars/discoloration, or if it does, then it does it very gradually. My acne scars are less severe, but I also have been using different products to assist with that.The product doesn't irritate my skin and can be used daily to wash the face. I am obsessed with this cleanser! It lathers on nicely and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. I was apprehensive to buy ANOTHER face cleanser, but I saw this one & for its rave reviews and super low price I thought why not? Have been using this for 2 weeks now & really love it. The awesome thing about this cleanser is a pea size amount goes a LONG way. It really lathers which I love. The feeling you get after this cleanser is awesome - it doesn't dry yet your skin feels squeaky clean. Even in 2 weeks I can notice a big difference in the brightening of my skin. Ive noticed it's made my pores tighter as well. Will continue to use day & night for even better results in the long run! Love the creamLove the smellLove the feeling really like it. makes face feel smooth. haven't seen a BIG lightening effect but I've been out in the sun a lot though. would get it again when it runs out. Fast shipping, so far the smell is neutral and good. My face feels soft & clean! :) I have not come across a cleanser that better agrees with my skin. I continually buy it.Skin Type: Mildly dry I love this cleanser! It has a smooth feeling after washing. Must try."
B014KE7YSC," She like it So happy with this!! Works well .. received fast i have no idea who buy this but its white Great product, does what it's supposed to! This is the second time I purchased this brush set (the first broke after a year). I love how it cleanses my face. The price is affordable. I did have a very expensive facial brush prior, not only did that stop charging after 6 months but it didn't clean my skin as well. I prefer this facial brush. I bought one for me and one for my daughter. We love it. Works great. Had more parts that I need, but it was rather inexpensive. I've used this a few times already since I have received this, I believe it only requires 2 AA batteries and is good to go!I don't know how waterproof this is, but I'd rather not take this in the shower and ruin it, but it does have a body scrub head as well that you could use, though I've only used it for the face so far Great facial cleanser. Exfoliates your skin great. Leaves your face felling great and cool. Soft to the touch. Second time ordering this product.  It lasts only about 8-10 months but it's inexpensive and great quality.  My daughter also purchased one.  Definitely like that it is waterproof.  I use the larger head on my face and neck.  My daughter uses the smaller head on her face. I love this product. It came exactly as expected and works perfectly. The battery compartment was a little tough to open, but that's what makes it waterproof so that's ok. My boyfriend opens it with no problem. It works wonders for my skin! And the brushes feel so soft and refreshing. This gets the job done perfectly! Already starting to see changes in my skin Love how easy this was to use. It really smoothed my face. Works as advertised Really great price.. I really like this product. Teresa are many out there but compared to price. Really nice for money I wont be able to tell you whether the soft makeup applicator thing is useful or not, for obvious reasons, but as a hairy dude, I have to say it helps a lot in washing your body and face (especially with my beard). If you have long hair, be careful because the rotating motion of it might get your hair stuck. I love it.  I needed it for my face and works perfect. It might not be that powerful to use on your feet if you have super hard skin, but  that is an extra gadget that i appreciate and it work for me. Awesome, very easy to use, love the sponge (so soft).  My skin is smoother. I'm very pleased with the FLYMEI Facial Brush and the fact that it's waterproof makes it extremely convenient to use and clean. I would recommend this product to those who what a gentle cleaning . That said, I have used the facial brush with an exfoliate with good results. i love it thank you Good quality easy use We Bought this for our daughter in law.  She seems very happy with it.  It was delivered in the time promised and was packaged well.  Looks great. She was happy- so we are happy. Love it Great product, I use sun screen every day. The larger brush was just right for cleansing arms and legs. The facial brush was excellent for removing the products on my skin and left my face and neck area feeling clean and fresh. I use this facial brush everyday! The speed isn't very fast but I think it's good when you're using it on your face and neck. The makeup and gunk from the day comes off easily. I would buy again. Works well, no issues I love this brush, it leaves my skin feeling so soft. I just use it with my favorite cleanser and it works great. I love the pumice stone too. It worked way better than I thought it would and removed a lot of the dead skin on my feet Bought this brush for my boyfriend and he loves it!! It is truly waterproof! It's also great because it comes with 4 different attachments. You don't have to buy them separately like some of the pricier brushes. This is good for a deep down facial cleansing, it could be a little more powerful though but it gets the job done. Love that this facial brush doesn't just vibrate but spins in a circle. Had this for almost two years (two months shy) and its now showing signs of needing to be replaced. i'd say its definitely worth a try. This mechanical brush is amazing!  It got deep into my pores, and my skin has never felt better.  I've used the large brush and pumice for an ""at home pedi"", and was incredibly happy.  The brush doesn't spin as fast as I like, but it does a great job. I bought one for me and loved it soo much I bought 3 more as gifts! Don't spend hundreds, these are just as good as the expensive brands. I've had mine for over a year and it still works like it's brand new! ,tem described perfectly, very satisfied customer I love love love this facial cleansing brush! The speed is perfect and its waterproof. I would recommend. Freaking love this face scrubby! It works amazingly well and leave my face feeling so hot. I wasn't too sure about this product before purchasing but my friend convinced me to try it. Super glad I did! this is perfect this is what i am really looking for :-) it lessen me to go my derma for regular facial scrub :-) Works great and arrived the next day. Thanks! AWESOME! The brush is identical to the ones that other 3rd party sites put their names on and sell for $90. It works great, exactly what I needed, love it and recommened to to everyone that compliments my skin Love it! Good product,good services -Works great.-Exfoliates nicely and not harshly.-Comes with extra spinning heads: Body, pumice stone (for feet), and smaller face brush I bought one of these for myself 2-years-ago. I love it so much, I bought my Daughter one this year for Christmas. She loves it too! Got this for my 16 year old granddaughter for her birthday.  She loves it! I absolutely love this set.  It is gentle to your face and body.  I use the sponge on my face to apply cleanser then the facial brush to gently clean face and clean those deep pores around my nose.The big brush for the body is great for my chest and back. I can actually get my whole back. I reach behind my shoulders and get half my back and then down to complete lower back by dropping arms down and going up.  It gently scrubs back. I use it on arms also.  I love the pumice stone - after soaking bath use the pumice stone to gently smooth out heels of feet.I have used other brands but this offers more options with different brushes. It only has 1 speed.  I like that.  I have another facial cleaner with 2 speeds but the fast is really too rough on skin. So I was glad that I only have one speed - gentle cycle.Now it does take 4 AA batteries and is waterproof - not where you can float it in water - just water getting on it will not disable unit. I use it in shower also with no problem.If I have any problems later I will definitely return and let you know.  Otherwise this is a winning combination and I highly recommend !!! Great product. The brushes are soft and not to harsh especially for my sensitive skin. Would recommend I'm  so excited. I  never thought  i'd be in love with  a battery operated  machine. But  thisFacial  and Body Ultra Brush Exfoliation  Kitis Amazing. I'm  so happy that  it's helping meto improve  my skin.  I feel  and look so muchbetter Really cleans the dirt out of pores and for a lot less money than the popular brands. Leaves skin smooth & clean. Works wonders! cleared up my skin and made it smooth and fresh looking. I got one for my son and he likes it too. Highly recommend. Head can fall off if not held upright, but other than that works very well! I have paid many times more for a similar product, but I have never had a facial brush that came close to this one. It's very study and well made. It holds the batteries securely and sealed from water leakage. I like the big brush, the motor has plenty of power to maintain its spinning (RPMs). I recommend this unit and the extra brushes highly. I rise it off after using the brush but I have never immersed the entire unit. So far no rust, leakage or problems. For a guy it beats all the face scrubs, your face feels very clean with all the dead skin cells removed. Absolutely love! The quality of the brushes is great. I definitely recommend this product.! I really love this product. It comes with several different heads that are very easy to put on. It creates a very nice lather and my face feels so much more clean than with a basic facial loofah. This was ordered to use on my face. But I have discovered it works great in the shower TOO. I love to use a self tanner and this is great to prep arms.  Works fabulous as a facial tool too.  Very Happy for this purchase. A great product thus far, has my face feeling dead-skin free and clean, would recommend anyone to make the purchase. Love! its works well with cleaning my face. I just wish they had an exfoliating head as well. I have had very good results with the body and facial brushes.  It makes skin feel really clean and glowing.  It is easy to change brushes, and the size makes it easy to hold and use. I really like this product! It has one speed, not to fast not to slow! Very easy to change the heads on it. So far no complaints! Absolutely great. Helps me with my oily skin due to my big pores! Leaves my skin super clean & smoothe, the brushes are soft so when your washing your face it's not hurting you or damaging your skin. I'm very happy with my purchase... this item shipped fast, i love how it comes with different attachments. It is very gentle on the face and really gives you a deep clean. purchased for my daughter.  Works great for her. I will get one for myself!!! best beauty product for cleaning and smoothing you skin.Would recommend for every one it replaces all those other brushes very fast and easy to use.

Strongly suggest these to anyone with acne problems! AMAZING!  Love this product. very good nice Nice Great product and price. I loved it !!!! Love it! Love, love, love this product. Been using if for about a month and it works very well for everyday or every now and then exfoliation and cleansing. Leaves my skin feeling so soft and clean. Awesome quality and waterproof. I dropped on the tile floor outside of my tub and it opened (meaning the battery compartment top came of), but nothing was actually broken. For all the tops you get, 2 brushes, 1 pumice, 1 sponge, plus the handle, you're not getting a better deal. I'm incredibly happy with this product. Will definitely re-order if it ever breaks or needs replacing. love it!! just what I needed. WILL PURCHASE AGAIN. I love this is my third order I love it. It makes my face soft and clean Great product for everyday use or just occasional. Large hand held with variety of brushes - great price and would recommend Love it I like this brush and the larger one for the body is wonderful !!

My facial skin is so much clearer now. A Just I finally bought one that was waterproof. Love it ! it works great! Beautiful love love love it very much love face It's really nice love it Good for the face The wife loves it! Love thisp Absolutely love it Works Great! A gift no complaints it's really good, my friend recommended it to me and I don't regret following her. love it Love It! I am always leary of battery operated gagets because I have bought some before that stop turning if you use the slightest bit of pressure. I wanted this one because of the attachments for the feet. I tryed this as soo as I recieved it. Plenty of power for removing caluses in yor feet. First one that has worked. I am going to buy one for my daughter for a Christmas present. I think she will like it too. Brushes also work great. I like to exfuliate a couple times a week. Hope it lats as long as my old Revlon facial brush did. My son loves this and uses it in the shower for his face and back (acne). Love it"
B005BJ69V4," you get 2 of these all i use This stuff is awesome. I have a problem with acne A great creamy mild smelling cleanser that doesn't dry out my sensitive skin. works great and it smells good. Love this face wash We love the fresh tingle. My whole family uses this face wash. I bought a small size of this just to travel with and liked it so much I use it regularly now. Not sure that this is an everyday cream, though. I feel like it could really dry out my face if I did that. I interchange this with the Daily Pore Cleanser and that suits my needs really well. I love this product. I use it twice a day, every day and I love the results and I can definitely see and feel the difference in my skin. I would recommend anyone to get this product. You won't regret it. You'll also enjoy that cool, refreshing tingle you get while using the product. Love it. i've been using this product for quite a long time, been subscribing from amazon. it does the work, and clean my face thoroughly, and moisturize the skin at the same time. i don't feel dry on my skin after cleaning.i'm picky on my skin care product. i've used high-end salon brand like YonKa. i have to admit that yonka is better, in terms of the tender feeling and the level of moisturized feeling after face washing. however the price wise, this is much better. Yonka is like $40 dollars for a small bottle, and this is like $5 for a big tube. it's not as good, but really, good enough. For this price, it's actually more than enough.one comment about the formula thing mentioned as other reviewer. I personally didn't notice anything as mentioned by the other reviewer. I've been using this product for long enough to know how it feels on my face, and i have a sensitive skin condition. I don't think i've experienced lower quality or even different quality of the product. The packaging IS a bit different, like the color from whole dark green to a dark-to-light color, wording slightly different, but same old good to me.bottom line, i would recommend this product to my friends. thanks. This is my all time favorite face wash. The item was set as a double pack with a great price. I will be back when I run out. Clears my face almost instantly the next day, feels refreshing as well! I have tried so many different face washes in my lifetime and this one has worked wonders for me. I haven't had any break outs at all since using this and my complexion is looking alot better. I will not be using anything else on my face again. I have tried other acne skincare products and this is really the only thing that keeps and makes my skincare clear.  I guess I just need to stick with what works. Nice cleaning without stripping or over drying. Light smell and rinses clean... not happy with amazon inconsistent pricing on this item ... Cleans your face with a tingle.  I love it Silky smooth feeling Great product works great Exactly what I ordered, works great on my face and does not dry out my skin I've used this face wash for a very long time. I've tried other ones and would break out almost every single time after a few days. I think I'm just going to keep sticking with this one. As long as I use it consistently as least once a day, I never get any pimples Doesn't dry out my skin and cleans well to remove makeup. I use it twice a day -  once in the morning and once at night. After I use it, I always apply moisturizer and I feel nice and fresh! The convenience of getting this product through subscribe and save is awesome! We have been using this for years and don't see us stopping any time soon. I have sensitive skin and everything else dries me out. I started using this as a teenager on advice from my doctor to cure my zit problem. It worked wonderfully. I have kept using it ever since, and now see the effect is I have the face of someone decades younger. I've used it since early I was a teenager so on around 13 years! This is a great deal, cheaper than buying at Walmart even. Over a year ago I had a bad breakout-the first time I had a problem with adult acne.  I had pimples all over my face. I have very sensitive skin, and slightly oily T-zone on my face.  I thought perhaps the cause was my makeup.  I changed foundation (from MAC, which I love, to Clinique).  No change, I still had the bad breakout.  I changed my skin cleanser.  I always used the hypoallergenic store brands.  Still, that did not clear up my skin.  I even resorted to the home remedy of applying hydrocortisone cream liberally to my face before bed.  Even that did work. Acne creams did not work. Nothing worked until I used Clean & Clear. My skin cleared up in 2-3 days.  I use it daily, and I have not had another breakout. My skin is clear.  I am quite pleased with this product.  The cream has a ""medicine"" smell, but that is fine, because it is effective.  It does the job. It keeps my face clean. This feels great after you use it and I actually ended up buying this in the store because I had issue with my order.It cleans your face I applied it all the way down mu neck I have been using this for years now. With the marvelous tingling sensation on my face it has given me some great feeling skin. I only use it once every 3-4 days but this is my preferred ""soap"" when I shave my face. My girlfriend and I love this product because of the tingly refreshing sensation it gives. This face wash is great for a daily cleanser and it keeps me acne free! My go-to morning cleanser. It's very gentle and doesn't dry skin out too much, though I do recommend using it in conjunction with something a bit stronger like Neutrogena's Oil Free Acne Wash. I have been using this product for years and absolutely love it. Afraid to try anything else that I will be gravely disappointed. Great face wash; feels refreshing and doesn't dry out my skin. I've been using it for years and it's the best face wash I've used. I LOVE this product! I've been using this product since I was 15 yrs old growing up in Toronto, back then I had occasional breakouts but when I found this product it all went away. Of course when you wash your face you are going to need a moisturizer and the product of choice for a 15 year old was Ponds back then. Today I am 32 and I am still using this product I actually swear by it, I have gotten lots of people to use it and they love it, plus I get compliments all the time about my skin when I meet new people whether professionally or socially. I LOVE LOVE this product. Note I have tried other products and none have come close to my skin feeling and looking healthy as it does on this product. If I could share a picture on here before I started 17 years ago, I would. Remember after you cleanse you need a great moisturizer to nourish your face. Been using this cleanser for years. Really hard to find in Australia at a good price so happy to find on Amazon. Love the cool sensation on my face, always feel fresher and oil free after using. works great for me, have used it for years, never really tried anything else. Very nice and clean. It looks like my pores became less visible. I love this. My face is smoother and brighter since I started using this. I use this cleanser 2-3 times a day and have used it for years. It's the only cleanser that I can use. It's gentle and not drying at all. I recommend it to everyone. Big fan of the cleanser & the fresh, tingly feeling after washing my face. Came across it when borrowing it from a friend.  Very refreshing in the morning Love the way this feels on the skin my favorite face wash it makes my skins refresh This is working great for my 13 year old son This is my go-to cleanser. Excellent because the cost per ounce is less than the bigger bottles.  Down side is that you have 144 mini bottles of face wash. Bought a face scrubber and this off of here and I love it This is my favorite face wash and I have been using it for as long as I can remember. I love the cool tingly feeling that leaves my face feeling fresh when I wake up in the morning. It keeps my face clean and prevents any unwanted breakouts or blemishes. I do have to scrub rather hard after wearing a face full of makeup but it does eventually come off without using dedicated makeup remover. The price on amazon is amazing! Usually these cost about 6 bucks in CVS or another store.. this pack of 2 for just under 9 bucks is a phenomenal deal. I always order my face wash from amazon now! Plus, then I always have a backup for when I run out! easy buy Not as abrasive as you may think... Does the job, and it doesn't over dry out my skin which I am sensitive to... It Works Great!! I've been using this cleanser for a few years now. I have very sensitive skin and am alway afraid to try new products. I will continue to use this cleanser forever- I love it! Yes the formula seems different than it was previously...however, I still think it's great. It cleans my face well and it gives you this tingly feeling after you wash it off. It does not dry out your skin. The bottle lasts a long time too even using it at least twice a day! My face love this Very good use all the time my go to face wash for my sensitive skin. Getting the four pack saves more cleans my face. Love the smell Best facewash I've ever had Good Price Best cleanser ever! Excellent product for the price. Great product! Great product! Were the United States government not so inclined to over-classify everything, it wouldn't be very difficult to discover from various embassies around the world that I've routinely used this product since the late '90s, and that to this date it remains a sturdy (or ""stalwart"" as my dermatologist routinely kept suggesting ,unsolicited mind you, in a few initial drafts of this) pillar in my facial regimen. Throughout all of this time, and through some at times painful variation, I've now been able to integrate it mostly into this formula, that has served both myself and more importantly my public, quite efficiently. As follows to those concerned :1.Hot towel 2.Lather 3.Shave 4.Deep action cream 5. Hot towel 6. Rinse. Since I was about 16, (I am 23 now) my acne was not horrible but existed. I tried pretty much all acne creams and washed. I even tried of those acne weird machines. None of it really worked, although some of the stuff helped. This stuff really did not help. It cleared most if not all of my acne from my face. I don't why it did more vs some of other products (which some were much more money than others), but it did. I am glad it did. I would highly recommend this stuff if you're struggling with acne. I use this cleanser in combination with the dual action moisturizer. I used to have issues with adult acne, but no longer. It is not harsh, but does a great job of removing make-up. I feel clean, but not ""stripped"" after washing my face. Pretty good face cleanser. It is not too dry and not too oily. Cleanses my oily skin in less than a minute leaving a cool mint texture over my face. Very good product and service. The ítems arrived in time and the price was the best in that moment.I am very satis fied Awesome! Cheap and exactly what I use! Will defiantly be ordering again when I need it. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS STUFF, REACH BEFORE I WAS EXPECTING, GOOD PRICE AND I RECOMMENDED IT VERY MUCH very good I've tried many cleansers, and I keep going back to this one. I love that ""cool, fresh tingle,"" and it leaves my skin soft and clean. It doesn't remove all my eye makeup, but neither does any other cleanser I've tried. It's a great deal, especially when you sign up for Subscribe & Save. I have been using this product every morning for 10+ years. No other face cleansing product has made my skin feel as clean and refreshed as this one, and I have tried many of them. I also have fairly sensitive skin, so I have tried the sensitive skin version of this cleanser, but that seemed to irritate my skin more for some reason, so I've stuck to this version. My husband has even used this on occasion and loves the sensation on his face. I would definitely recommend this as a go-to facial cleanser! For all you sensitive people out there..THIS IS THE WAY TO GO! I've went through countless facial washes for sensitive skin and this is the only one that did the job and did it WELL! I can't go a day without using it and just one bottle lasts a little over a month, sometimes more. And I use it twice a day! The best part is how soft and refreshed your face feels afterwards. There is a hint of menthol in it which made me hesitant, but it wasn't an issue with my super sensitive skin. Just made the refreshing part that much enjoyable! And for the most important part, IT CLEARS ME RIGHT UP. I used to get what seemed like knots on my face because I had a hint of cystic acne, but since I've been using this product for about 5 months...I rarely see anything like that anymore. Just a few little pimples here and there. It's great! I've never been more happy with my skin! This is a creamy cleanser which washes very well. I originally got it for my 14 year old daughter who gets a few flare ups from time to time and it has become a fave of my 7 year old. She does not like washing her face with soap. The soap foams or is bubbly and irritates her eyes. This goes on w/o lather and rinses easily. My daughter's faces are glowing w/o the dry patches my youngest used to get and w/o the oily t zone my teenaged daughter normally had. It also removes make up well. It can be used wet to remove make up and dry as well. I like dabbing some on my eyes and rubbing with a tissue to rid my eyes of my daily use of mascara. This will be put into our daily rotation and I will purchase again when we run out. I started using Clean & Clear Deep Action Cream Cleanser back when I was a teenager with acne and oily skin. It worked great for me then and even though it didn't get rid of my acne, it really made my face feel much cleaner. The refreshing scent and cool feel of the cleanser worked wonders and was the best out of all of the cleansers out there that I tried (and believe me, I tried A LOT). In recent years, I switched to other facial cleansers to try something new and save a little money but I was never as satisfied as I am with this cleanser so I have started using this again! Even though I no longer have much acne and oily skin, it still feels great on my face. I love the way this face wash makes my skin feel soft and so much cleaner than anything I've ever used before. There is a sensitive skin version of this face wash if you need to try that too. Since we already have the Subscribe & Save with Amazon, it was easy to add this to our shipment so we save even more money while still getting me my favorite facial cleanser! If you've never tried this before, I would recommend giving it a try because even after about 15 years or so, this is still my favorite and I wouldn't hesitate to suggest it to anyone who needs a good face wash. I highly recommend this! This is a good face wash. First of all, the scent is mild and fresh, but not in a perfumed way -- just clean. I've used it with a washcloth and scrubbed it in, giving my face a really refreshed feel. It easily stripped away excess oil and makeup, but my face did not at all feel dry and tight when I was finished. After using my usual makeup, my face did not show any increase in oiliness and I never developed a dry, flaky skin either. So, I'd have to say if your skin is sensitive, you will get very good results from this product. I certainly did! I have used many products in the show to try and get rid of my acne. This tingles and sometimes is a bit over bearing but you know its deep cleaning. It took me until I was in my early 20s to figure out how to quell my teenage acne.  I have very oily skin, and found that no matter how often I washed my face, it would just get oily again quickly, resulting in a perpetual breakout.  At one point, a doctor told me that I may actually need to use facial moisturizer, which made no sense at all.  But I tried it.  I started using this product once a day, while showering, and after drying off I'd moisturize my face with Clean and Clear Dual Action Moisturizer.  My skin quickly began to calm, oiliness dissipated, and acne cleared up.  I've been using the combination of these two products for five years now with no breakouts at all.  And as a guy, I'm happy that this regimen is neither time consuming or complicated.This product in general is great.  The cooling menthol feeling is refreshing, and it smells great.  The ""New Formula"" feels a bit thinner (old formula was very thick and pasty) but seems to work just as well.  New formula or old, this product is a MUST in my house. I keep this in the shower and use it every morning. The deep action clean cleanser helps make my face feel so clean and tingly! Helps me wake up in the morning. First off cheaper at rite aid as you can see cause the price is on my bottle still. I didn't order it I brought it at rite aid. But I have horribly sensitive skin I tried proactiv and probably everything else in the world so I had to leave this review. This is amazing stuff I've only been using for a few weeks but even after my first day my pores were GONE face was smooth and it didn't dry out my skin. I'm in love. I first started using this product when I was in middle school, and now I'm 31 (!).  The fresh, tingly sensation is a big reason why I love this face cleanser, but I also like how it's not drying.  I'm currently using this as my in-shower face wash, but I might try it with a Clarisonic, as another reviewer recommended; I imagine it would work very well that way. I love this cleanser, I was looking for something that was like a cream but refreshing (and gentle), this fits the bill. I use this pretty much every day and have noticed an improvement in my complexion since I started using it, it seems to cleanse better than what I had before (cetaphil) without being too tough, a difficult line for me to toe with my sensitive skin. Recommend for those with sensitive skin looking for something a little more refreshing and powerful than your typical cream cleanser. I have tried a lot of face cleaners over the years and was very impressed by this one.  It has a nice fresh scent and isn't drying like a lot of other products.  It has a cream consistency and doesn't lather like soaps so I was a little skeptical at first.  I've been using it for a week and my face has been very clear so it is doing the job.  Great face wash. Great for removing makeup.  Not greasy.  Use daily. This is a great cleanser that leaves you with a great clean feeling, without any irritation.  This is a nice, gentle cream cleanser.  It does not have a quite heavy lather, but it goes on your skin smooth.  It washes off very easily as well, and does not dry out my skin.  I have sensitive skin, and this product works great on my face. So far so good. Works well seriously try it Excellent super duty case Shipped quickly, cases as described. Happy customer!! convenient, flexible, sturdy  What a pleasant surprise. Thanks! these have proved to be reliable I've been using this product daily for probably 20 years (not exaggerating).  Every morning in the shower I put a little on a medium Buf Puf and scrub my face with it.  Result: I very rarely get blemishes, and at age 51 I still have a smooth clear complexion.  It's not a very macho thing to be doing, but it beats walking around with a faceful of zits."
B076F78NZQ," good I use this daily and love it Wonderful product, quick shipping Love it! Good brand, good product tried and true. My night cream. Arrived promptly and as expected. Moisturizing but light. Works just as expected. Started using, day received compliments on looking fresher.  I already look young for my age,  but people kept complimenting on my skin glowing and looking younger than before. Love it. Always use this cream, it's great. It's not oily or to fragrant.  You can feel the difference right away in your skins moisture. I love using olay regenerist. My skin always gets dry, and with olay, not anymore. Ive really noticed a softer and smoother appearance on my skin after just a few weeks. I cant use this before going to bed though as for some reason i always wake up with a breakout. So for at night, i use Alice Nouveau - Super C Anti-Aging Cream - Brightens, firms, Regenerates and love the fact that theres vitamin C in it. If you dont believe me, try it for yourself and you'll love your skin! One of the wife's basic stock of weapons. She has used this for years. I was exceedingly skeptical about purchasing a face product not made organically. I use only edible grade oils as everything else makes my rosacea go out-of-control. But I am in my mid-thirties now, it's cold, and my oils were not cutting it. This is my 4th product, Eclos being the first (works well but difficult to find), No. & (rosacea did NOT like), and Boot's Botanics (horrid smelling and rosacea irritating), then this stuff. The Regenerist system is wonderful. I use oil to remove my makeup, the cream cleanser to deep clean, then the serum and the cream. The latter I use in the morning and evening. My skin is silky and moisturized, and my fine lines have disappeared (I do not have any deep lines yet, so I can't speak to those). Most exciting (and unanticipated) is that my rosacea has improved after 1 week's use, the redness and sensitivity is nearly gone, which is a miracle during the winter months. It is much pricier than making all my own stuff, but well worth it for the fantastic results. I have two photos, one is a typical my-face shot, and the other (the one that insists on being effing sideways, sorry) is after a week's use. The difference in redness on my face and the texture of my skin is pretty cool, and both pictures are without filters/makeup. I hope this review helps someone! I am a for-life user! almost 42 years and love this product have been using for 3 years, found the bigger size on amazon and save  about $15 on price and free shipping with my prime. The product is working well. It does exactly as it is advertised & promoted to do. I am well pleases. Will repurchase with sustainable order. Great moisturizer,as good or better than department store brands at a MUCH better price. Amazon is a great place to purchase Olay products,less expensive than pharmacies and big box stores. I am on my third container of this moisturizer.  I am very happy with it.  The smell is good too.  I am 46 years old and I am trying to fight the aging process.  I watched Angie on youtube HotandFlashy and she reviewed this product: https://youtu.be/AWpblnNeZ1s  I use Retin-A as well and I use this afterward.  I notice that Regenerist helps tightened my skin and helps with my fine wrinkles. Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream 1.7 oz. Awesome product Its a better value then buying it directly from target. Love the price and love the product works great with my skin type I will be purchasing it again. Great for a general face regimen if you’re new to it! I’ve always had slight bags under my eyes but noticed a definite decrease since using the eye serum religiously - at night and in the morning. It’s not a miracle product, but works perfectly for what I needed it for. I’ve never had acne problems but I do have sensitive and dry skin. This product works great for me! This cream is excellent. I have been using it for quite some time now and you can truly see a difference. It is very affordable and does just a good a job as more expensive creams do. I would definitely recommend tit. ( I recommend to buy it from OLAY  and shipped from Amazon and no  from other sellers) I love how this feels on my face at night. Very creamy with a silky feel. My skin seems to look a lot better in the morning. Can't live without this stuff!  5 STARS*****Ran out and had to go a few days without it and I could ACTUALLY SEE the difference!  Great Stuff!! WORKS GREAT.  ONE OF THREE ITEMS I TRIED.  I WENT WITH THE PUMP BOTTLE FROM ANOTHER COMPANY BECAUSE IT'S EASIER TO USE AND THE PROUCT SEEMS THE SAME AS THE OLAY CREAM. Much more convenient then purchasing in a big box store. Works awesome, feels so great going on. Super fast shipping too! I have kept buying this product for years, probably since it came out. I love it and recommend to all my friends. This is wonderful lite weight cream for your face and neck! Recommend to all the gals I know, my husband loves it too! Been using it since it came out. I have tried other more expensive highly rated products and still come back to this one. Love - especially during the winter when the cold air is drying out my skin. I put this on over other creams and it doesn't feel heavy or thick but does moisturize so well. Made a huge difference on my wrinkles. Use religiously. I have had adult acne for years, and I just recently had a period where it was worse than usual.  By chance, my local grocery store had a pile of samples to get rid of so they sent me home with 30 or so single-use samples (like you sometimes get in a magazine).  Anyway, my complexion was so horrible at that point, I figured I'd give it a shot (and hey, it was free and this stuff is probably expensive, right?).  Within days, I noticed that my skin was remarkably smoother.  I couldn't believe it!  As my samples dwindled, I turned to Amazon to order a jar.  And I haven't gotten a new zit since I started using it over a month ago.  I'm shocked, and I wish I had stumbled upon this product sooner.  I may be a new Olay convert, and I'm definitely not giving up my new blemish-free face! i have used this product off and on over the past, but they have made some changes in it and it has shown up in my 77 year old faceto my delight. I've been using this line for several years, and do not get without it. I use the cream and the serum together just because I like to! Probably not necessary, but the serum just glides on like silk, and makes your skin feels so good! No product is perfect, but I find this line as good as the high dollar products I've tried in the past. My skin looks pretty good for 70! At 76 my skin looks amazing! From the first day there was a visible improvement in skin clarity and smoothness. Oh, I love this cream!!  It smells divine, not overpowering, but very soft.... and goes on creamy smooth. It takes about 5-10 minutes to fully absorb into my skin and it makes my skin feel great. I can use it day or night. I can put my makeup on soon after I apply the cream and it makes my skin a creamy-soft palette for my makeup. I would highly recommend this cream to anyone! I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  I come from a mom that swears by Este Lauder and I have used Este Lauder for years and loved it, but hated how expensive it was.  Finally I had decided that I was tired of spending $50-$100 per bottle and that I was going to find something that worked for less money.  I asked all of my friends what they recommended, and I didn't like them, so I thought I would start researching.  I needing a firming cream, because I have saggy skin around my eyes that likes to stick to my eye lid when I blink.  It drives me crazy!  It took me almost a year and many many products to find this one.  I LOVE THIS.  It evens out my skin tones and it firms up the skin above my eyes.  I don't like a lot of serums, and some creams, because once your body heats them up, they will a lot of times run into your eyes and burn your eyes.  I hate that, and it happens in most products.  This one does not do that!  It absorbs very well and I have never had it go into my eyes.  And the best part is that it is under $20.  WAHOOOOOO!  It doesn't get much better!My mom still buys me Este Lauder for my birthday, but I have a hard time switching back. I really like this product! I have tried a lot of different over the counter and department store products over the years. I started using Olay Regenerist Multi-sculpting cream a few years ago and am very pleased with the results. I find that it leaves my skin smooth, with an even tone. I purchased the fragrance-free version this last time and find I like it better than the one with the fragrance. Will continue to use this product for years to come. Love this product.  Use it and have used it on and off for years.  It always makes a difference in my skin when I use it 2x daily I have been using this product for almost 3 years and it really does work.  The company selling it on Amazon,  Bazinga Trading was fast and efficient when sending this product to me, which was a replacement for the one that I had broken when I fell on the ice.  I highly recommend this product to anyone with wrinkles and dry skin.  .I'm a diabetic and my skin dries out a lot and with this olay product, it really does moisturize.  I use olay deep cleansing products also. I recommend Olay to everyone. great quality item, good value for the price, item as described, good doing business with them, fast delivery i love this moisturizer. I use it everywhere at night, including my hands, and leaves my skin silky smooth! Best ever for your face. Not so much for your neck. Seems to tighten up my neck therefore adding to the wrinkle look. I love the Regenerist line of products and this cream does not disappoint. I use this one at night and the serum during the day. Love that it's truly fragrance free. I've had other fragrance free products that have an after smell I'm assuming from the ingredients in them. The Regenerist line stands up to any of the expensive department store products that promise miracles they don't deliver so why pay more? i've been using this product for the last several years.  it does a wonderful job of moisturizing my VERY dry face! Thank you so much for quick delivery! Wonderful cream for anyone over 50 like me and the price is awesome. I received this product on April 9th and used it for the first time that night. I'm using it in the morning under my makeup and at bedtime. With only 6 applications I can already see the difference. The smile lines around my eyes are already disappearing and my skin feels so smooth. My makeup goes on more easily and I look dewy and feel younger. I really like this product!  Absorbs in my skin and feels great!  Looking forward to seeing good results. There are many very expensive face creams out there, and I have tried most of them in the past. I am a 65 year old woman, who has used this product now for several years, and I put this one at the top of my list. I apply it every night after my bath. Not to brag, but most people think I am 15 years younger than I am, and I think part of it comes from the fact I have no wrinkles yet. I should add, however, I am extremely fit, watch my diet, and don't allow my ""years"" to dictate what I can and can't do! Been using this for sometime now.  I occasionally try more expensive products, but always come back this, as it works the best. I bought this over a month ago and am in love with it. I can already tell my skin is smoother and looks healthier. My fine lines are less noticeable. I wish I wouldn't have waited so long to try this. It only takes a little to spread over my face and I do use it in the morning and at night. I think each container will last at least 2 possibly 3 months Being 68 years old, a good face cream is necessary, but I cannot break the bank on high dollar department store creams. I have been using this for over 5 years, my face feels soft and of good texture. I often get asked what makeup I am using, and I tell them also about Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream, as I feel that contributes to my good skin!! Olay makes the best products for skincare! I have been using this as a staple for years and am constantly complimented on how youthful I look!! Best face cream I have ever purchased. Great moisturizer, helps my dry skin. I took part in a trial of this product and was very pleasantly surprised by what a great product it was. I had been using very expensive Estee Lauder moisturizers, but this is every bit as good and less expensive! I actually felt that my lines and wrinkles were less obvious while using this - so I've now switched. I have VERY sensitive dry skin, and this works very well for me (I'm in my 60s). I've used this for at least 5 years now,  it gets really good write ups regarding its wrinkle reducing properties and its not priced as high as some of the dept store brands.  People compliment me on my clear skin even though I'm into my 70's. Moisturizers the skin really well .Not sure of the anti ageing claims yet as I don't have wrinkles. But have noticed fading of scars .It does take a while to show the effect though .I apply it religiously everynight and wake up to a soft supple skin with even skin tone. It doesn't cause acne but doesn't help to suppress it either. All in all a good product which doesn't work miraculously,but does it job perfectly if used everyday . This is my favorite moisturizer as it goes on easily using a small amount, leaves your face feeling soft, not sticky and stays with me more than 24 hours in warm months and at least 16 hours during the winter. Face appears smooth; the moisturizer serves as a great foundation for makeup when it is used.  The surface of my face appears smoother after regular use of this moisturizer. Best decision I ever made was to switch to this line of products. If I use anything other than oil of Olay regenerist products I will have an adverse reaction to them. I use the entire line. I love Oil of Olay products.  They work for me. My skin looks better and my wallet is happy. Same exact product as the stores and half the price.Amazon buys the product from Olay like all the stores that carry the product and there is no difference.I'm over fifty and use a little more during the winter months and it works great. LOVE Olay, I started using it when I was in my 20's and now I'm in my 40's people think I'm in my 30's. Great texture, not oily and smells great and light! Leaves your face refreshed and glowing! my mom who is 62 loves this she swear by itI have also use this am 32 it has helped prevent me from getting wrinkle I love Olay products.  My skin is a bit sensitive and is changing as I grow older.  Olay Regenerist Micro-sculpting cream helps maintain a youthful look without skin irritation or break out due to the product.  My skin is soft and holding steady....no miracles but I'm not asking for one in a jar...just some help. I really see diffrence.well made product.u should use it with hyaluronic acid to get more ... I love Olay!  I have used Erno Laszlo and did love their line of products!  However, for my money, Olay is perfect for me.  I use the Regenerist line-the daily facials both in the morning and evening, along with the serum in the morning and this one at night.  It works wonders!  I can really tell a difference if I don't follow my typical routine.  I always have lots of compliments on my skin and I never wear make-up! I tried it for the first time this morning, loved the lightly scented aroma, how it's creamy texture nourished my skin.No greasy feeling left behind, easily wearable all day.I would recommend this product to my family and friends. Have used this product for a long time....thinking of trying the NEW Olay regenerist that has just come out so hope I can get it through Amazon.  May take a while.  But this product produces very nice results for my skin and I'm 64 and had always been a sun worshipper. Plus it comes ""fragrance free"" as I don't like to smell my moisturizers. I originally tried this anti-aging cream in a trial size. I liked it so much I bought the full sized jar. I saw a visible reduction in the fine lines around my eyes and lips in one week. I was completely surprised by how quickly it worked. I have normal skin and never used a lot of lotions or serums since I wasn't concerned with dryness. Then I got older! Ugh! My midlife crisis has been spent trying to find the best product to retain as much fullness and elasticity in my skin as possible. Regenerist Micro-sculpting cream fits that bill. Unbeatable price. I had been using a different brand and wanted to try this cream, but it was so expensive in the store. I pulled it up on Amazon and BAM! Reasonably priced!  The cream does not feel greasy, or thick. Smooth and light I can't imagine going back to my old cream. The best product you can get at a grocery store, amazing for the price. My old standby I'm only 23, and I've been through many different kinds of moisturizers. I deal with the occasional under the skin horrible pimple that gets massive that I tend to pop. This product didn't seem to appeal to me at first glance, but after buying it, I was in love. It's sooo creamy and I haven't had a breakout since. My skin looks healthy every day and I'm really happy to not have anymore massive breakouts. I think I've found my for life moisturizer! I am 37 years old and I have used Retin A for over a year. While I like Retin A, one of the side effects is excessive dryness and sensitivity.  This is the first product that I have tried that works excellent and I have tried: expensive creams, rosehip oil, olive oil, vaseline, and on and on.  Long story short, I just received my bottle two days ago and already bought another because it is amazing.  Plus, I used if faster than I wanted to because I can't resist the urge to use it on my hands and stomach. I have been using this cream since Monday, today is Wednesday and I am already seeing results very satisfied. Thanks a lot! love this product .Love the smell.Noticed a change in my texture . Great moisturizer. No fragrance. Leaves skin feeling hydrated all day. I still look like a fifty year old though... it's not the wonder cream the ads claim it is. Nice daily moisturizer though. This works well--does not clog pores or sting.  Soothing and spreads smoothly. LONG LASTING IF YOU APPLY TO A DAMP FACE.  DOESN'T FEEL HEAVY. I FEEL PROTECTED.... It was as you would expect from OLAY. Some of their products I like and some I don't . I liked this one. Love this creme. Works really great . I am 68 years old and have no wrinkles. Very happy with this product. Works better than some much more expensive creams. Smoothing and feels great on dry skin Works very well and last a long time. My beauty regimine.  Love this cream. I used to be an Elizabeth Arden woman---then financial reality hit and I shopped and switched to Olay...and ever since my 40's (I'm now 56) I've used some advance version of Olay.... and I love their products, and particularly this and I DO use it along with a night treatment of Olay's Regenerist Night Recovery Cream.Once on skin is noticeably smoother...and I'd say over the years, the product has reduced the onset, or depth or increase of wrinkles... I have them, I do, but my skin is quite nice---sure some is genetic, but I do attribute, openly: THIS is MY reason. The other nice thing, is when I do wear makeup (about twice a month), the make up goes on much, much nicer. My wife loves it she said it does not leave her face feel oily and very clean. All Oil of Olay products are the best for me. I have been using their products since I was 14. Definitely firms! Always a favorite. Works every bit as good as, and better than some, department store higher priced moisturizers. Good price, although Sam's can sometimes match the price. Good moisturizer.  Helps keep my skin healthy, especially if scraped. Light and refreshing...I love Olay products and this is no different. Use everyday with my foundation. Makes it more sheer and feels nice. Anything from Olay is wonderful for the face.  This cream is Devine! I swear by this product.  Wouldn't be without it.  Good price, fast delivery! I have been using Olay for more than 20 years.  Love this product Smells wonderful. A little goes a long way. I use twice a day. My face feels amazing. I  really like this cream. I was a little hesitant before buying it because my face is really sensitive and i brakes out easily. Hoever, this cream has helped dimish some scaring ive had from blemishes. Fine lines are not as visible as when i started (almost a month ago). I use this cream as my hydrating cream befor putting on any makeup on and ive been surprised at the fact that i have not been braking out as i use to. Will be buying again soon! Does Olay ever make a bad product? I wore the original Olay in the bottle when it was pink. My skin which is sensitive has no problem with this product. I can't say I look younger but it seems to help with softening the lines. It work good on my face not breakouts which is most important I tried many different products but this one works the best! There's a sucker born every minute, and I am one of them.La Mer?  Yep, I bought that.Chanticaille?  Yep, guilty.Philosophy?  Yep, there's hope in my jar.Skinceuticals?  Yep, that too.Expensive salon facials?  Yep, I did those.The end results of all my expensive facial product experiments?  Nothing earth-shattering.  If I'm being honest, I liked the La Mer, but I like the Olay Regenerist just as much, and it's waaaaay cheaper.  This is a really good moisturizer, and the best I've ever found at this price point.  It won't perform miracles, but then again, what does?I will continue to buy this.  It's my go-to in the winter months when my skin is drier.  I'm done wasting money on expensive gimmick facial creams. I am 80 yrs old, and just the other day while shopping, I met a lovely lady about my age.  She asked me how did I keep my face looking so soft and clear.  I smile ta her and just said OLAY.I have been using Olay for over 7yrs.  And I guess I shall coninue until the big boss upstairs calls me home. I use this as my daily moisturizer and I love it. It feels light, absorbs quickly, and doesn't leave my skin feeling like there is anything on it. Love it!!!! Ive got at least 10 people hooked on this now. 😍 loving it,,,so easy non greasy no film left on your skin Have been using this product for many years. Very effective. Great product I love it. Really could tell a difference This moisturizer is very good and you don't have to use much for it to take effect. Coming from a male with combination skin, I can say that this product has really eliminated my dry spots on my face. I like it, it does it's job, very well priced Not greasy!  No overpowering scent and works as stated I've been using this moisturizer for the past 4 years. My skin is better than ever. This moisturizer does work it hydrates skin giving it that glow, u can just see it. I love using b4 I go to bed at nights Excellent creme. Have been using it for year with great results! I've been using Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream for at least 15 years. I love it. Once in a while I get stupid and try another moisturizer but I always give it away and go back to Regenerist. Goes on easily, blends well, makes skin look better Excellent!!! Well worth it - I look refreshed and glowing when I wake up the morning after putting this on! A great cream for overnight, moisturizes and leaves my face feeling refreshed! My mother has always had beautiful skin - even at 88 years old.  Oil of Olay has always been her go to product.  Unfortunately,  I didn't catch onto how important moisturizers were until I was in my 40's.  Now Im trying to play catch up.  I ordered this cream and have been using it everyday.  My skin is so much softer and clearer.  I love how it goes on easily and absorbs quickly.  I hate the feeling of a heavy cream.  It just makes me want to go wash my face all over again.this product is so light and feels good on.  Sometimes I will add a few drops of Frankincense oil to it for an extra boost for my skin. This product is great and definitely works as an anti-aging cream.  Thanks for a time tested and great product. I really like this product. This is a  2nd jar I'm ordered, work for me , my skin is soft and look younger. Excellent product!!!  Cannot start my day without it!! I'm not sure if I look any younger but my face has never felt softer! I like this cream and how it works on my skin this stuff works for moisturizing and firming Feels so nice on my face and smells good too! wife say it working i can't tell the difference Great product  !!! Great deal Thank you Spouse has been using this product for some time and has had good results. She likes the fact that Amazon makes the fragrance free version available. Very nice. works well. feels good on my face Great cream for the price! I am having good result using this product, and I feel that it does what it claims. Who knows if it's the best cream in the world, but I wouldn't want to try every expensive cream on the market! I feel satisfied with this product, and I don't feel ripped off by a beauty scam. My skin feels great, my fine lines are diminishing, my skin tone is evening out, and that's good enough for me. It works! It really works, you can see the difference in just a couple of days, supple skin and less loss of firmness. Love this product.  I've been using it for years. I love Olay Regenerist products as they do what they say they will do.....for me anyway....took 10 yrs or more off my face.  I have been using this products for a long time.....it works....for me. I saw this on Dr Oz as a good moisturizer at a decent price and have been using it for over 6 months and have found a few lines to have decreased and keeps my skin well hydrated. No need for the very expensive products he said and for me he was right. I like this no perfume one. It is also cheaper on amazon. I love this since it penetrates quickly. Nice moisturizer that doesn't feel greasy. Great for the backs of your hands makes them look smooth and younger. It was packed great I'm 46 with crows feet just starting to show I have oily skin big pores I have been using it morning and night 2 weeks now it's shrunk my pores no clogging and wrinkles are slowly diminished. I have been using Olay regenerist as my night time cream for years. It has a nice scent and absorbs quickly. No greasy film. Leaves my face feeling soft. I bought this product to help with mosture and skin balance issues, as I have combination skin. I love how much healthier my skin looks, it looks younger my time has evened out and a couple of darker spots that I have have started to fade. I would recommend this product to my friends and have! best cream out there no use paying more This is my second time purchasing this product.  I love it because it is an excellent moisturizer and after just approximately 3 uses it made my skin absolutely beautiful sort of like baby skin.  I have received so many compliments. Makes my skin look and feel wonderful. My favorite face cream, I have been using it for years. Tried over creams but they aren't as good, leaves my skin very soft and moisturized. Love it. Have been using it for years Very happy with delivery, packaging, and price. Extremely content with this products performance in general. I love Olay. This moisturizer is very good, not greasy, light weight feeling, absorbs fast, but leaves my skin very subtle, glowing, soft, and brighter. Can't say enough about this cream. Already see a difference with my fine lines. I have been using this for years and it works like it says it will. Good stuff. This cream really lives up to its hype. It left my skin feeling as smooth as possible. Considering that I am pushing 80 years old, that's saying something! I think that it's definitely worth the money you will spend purchasing it. I would compare it favorably to the more expensive creams that you could get in a department store. I've only been using this for a couple of days but can really feel a difference.  Great texture, great feeling to the skin and I'm confident my skin will continue to look better and better each day.  A great product at a great price. Wife very pleased with  product !!! Keeps the wrinkles less prominent. It's a nice, thick cream. Nourishing and firming. Have bought it for several years now and will continue buying. Ok for day use and before bed! FAST shipping and great product!! Great night cream .. didn't cause any breakouts .. makes my skin look and feel great The best moisturizer ever! I use it on my face, arms, legs, everywhere. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE...... I have overly dry, super sensitive skin and this product moisturizes and hydrates without any irritation at all. Best face cream ever. Thank you omg feels like heaven on my face. just the softness from this cream makes it worth the buy. I totally love OLAY, i have been using it their products for almost ten years. Still love it, will not stop using it. My all time fav in body care. Best cream I have ever used. Good, like all Olay products This really works and tightens areas especially under the jaw and around the neckline. It is also not greasy so I use it before going to work. Love it..using it for years Best moisturize for the price. Good ingredients,  great price. I keep trying other products, b I purchased this well before Summer and was hoping to see some changes in the dark spots I have.  While I didn't notice any fading of the spots I will tell you a short story about this product.  I got into some poison ivy while hiking through the woods with my dog....needless to say it was a very hot and humid day in the Ozarks and I was constantly wiping my face to get the sweat out of my eyes.  I got home, showered as usual and the next morning woke up with BOTH eyes swollen shut and my entire face COVERED in blisters from the poison ivy.  DH rushed me to the urgent care and it took literally 3 months to completely rid myself of the stuff and what it did to my body (I had it everywhere).  When I was finally able to start putting moisturizer on my face I reached for the Regenerist because it was all I had on hand.  Mind you my face and neck were just horrible, it looked like I had been burned.  While it took about 8 weeks I do not have ONE single scar on my face from the incident.  I did not put anything else on my face but this product and I was/am totally amazed with the results.  Through the process I went through about 3 jars of it as I used it 3-4 times a day.  I will never put another thing on my face/neck.  This stuff was truly a miracle for me.  I was so afraid I would have scars or sever discoloration in my skin from the poison ivy but Regenerist did what it said it would do times 100!  I highly recommend it....and the dark spots, well, they are still there but I'll take those over what could of been any day! Best face cream out there. Very pleasantly surprised! Saw an improvement in a short amount of time. Nice fragrance and light feeling with no breakouts or irritation. Purchased the eye cream as well and will definitely be ordering both again! As Described always great Works! A friend of mine says her dermatologist told her its the number one seller and works best in its field. I purchased some. It does work great. I use it twice a day. No irritation or anything. Buy it and try it. I believe you can return it if not satisfied. I love the olay products. I am not allergic Smooth face and neck. Will buy again Reorder!  Great product. Great product. I order it every couple months. I have used everything from super expensive to cheap. I always come back to this. I commonly get mistaken for 30's and I am 42. When I put it on I di it in an upward motion. It has the directions in the package. Also Amazon has the best prices, and usually there is a coupon so make sure you look under the price, it will say clip coupon. It's usually $3 off. Can't beat that! Good price, as described Excellent product at a good price on Amazon.  I buy this and the serum and they are the last two layers I use on my skin atnight.  Has serious anti-aging ingredients that really make the difference. This stuff works wonders. I don't want to be without it. This is my very favorite moisturizer, which says a lot because I have tried many, many brands. I can honestly say that Olay works much better than brands like Clinique and Strivectin for me. Its hard to believe that after paying so much for other brands, I have found the best product at such a low price. I recommend to anyone who is considering buying more expensive choices to try this first. Great stuff. Does it really do more than moisturize my skin? Probably not- though the ingredients are fairly promising. It hydrates fantastically, doesn't break me out and is so much more improved without that nasty fragrance in the original formula. Love this moisturizer When a product describes exactly what the results will be you are skeptical .But when you receive this you find it is true! I would recommend this product highly! I have always like the Olay product line, good quality product for half the price of other products If Beautiful skin is what your looking, this is for you. Good price and Excellent product. Thank you! Great anti-aging cream. I love this product! Great product.  I get compliments about my beautiful skin (I am 58 yrs old) and this is the only product I use on my face after cleansing. Smooth and works at age 57 My mother loves it. I have been using this product for about 8 months.  No allergic reaction and skin feels soft after the cream ""soaks"" in. I use it at night  and another Olay product during the day. Always reliable for my dry, sensitive skin. Good moisturizer. My skin likes it! Great face cream! This face cream is great., have been using for several years. I’m 85, my daughter said I look young because of my maintence, a big part of my maintence is Olay Regeneriist . Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Moisturizer was recommended by my daughter Chantelle. Skeptical at first,I decided to go ahead and give it a try. I'm very glad I did. This is not a thick or greasy moisturizer. It goes on smoothly and my skin drinks it up, leaving no residue at all on my skin.Though I'm blessed with very good skin and was taught early how to care for it, i am 70 years old. A problem area for me is around the chin line, where two small but visible pouches are forming. Within one week of using this cream at night, the pouches are nearly gone! And the small lines beginning to show on my neck are nowhere to be seen.This is a lightly scented product, pleasant and fresh. This is going to be a regular part of my skin care regimen, because it works.And here on Amazon, the price is right! i had spotted it in a couple of local drugstore chains priced at $29.95. No thank you. Amazon has this beat by a good enough margin, it's worth keeping in my Subscribe and Save monthly orders. This cream is appropriate for mid thirties and up. An ounce of prevention now will save you pounds of frustration later. i highly recommend this product, Best lotion ever! Incredible product, good price, same at Walmart, but here you can use Amazon credit!!!!! I have been using this more than 4 years, and friend introduce me. I use it on my neck and chest, even with a turkey neck (like my mother in law used to said, she had) you can see a big improvement. Give it a try, you wont regret it!!!! I've been using this cream for the past 7 years now, and it's great for nighttime. Very thick, creamy, moisture packed, and smells really good! I do not use it in the morning since it cakes with my makeup. Love this item. I'm now on repeat Amazon subscription service to receive this item consistently. Love this product. My mom has used this for years and now that I'm 25 I think it is time for me to use it as well before I do get fine lines. Does take like 2 weeks to notice some differences Best cream ever Awesome product good moisturizer Good moisturizer Consistently great moisturizer. I really appreciate the results when I run out for a few days and can see the difference it makes with fine lines.  Fragrance free is the only one I'll use.  Unlike prior reviews it clearly has Olay on the lid and is labeled made in the USA, so I guess they resolved that issue.  My last order arrived early. Great products I absolutely love this product. It has a great smell and feels wonderful on my skin. It softens my skin and makes it feel moisturized. Love this. for my griend great product Great product This product is wonderful.  I have used Olay skin products for years and everyone tells me my skin looks young which is quite a compliment as I am 75 years old. Love it.  Use it every night. Very smooth. Goes on well without sticky or waxy feeling. Absorbed quickly. Used over Regenerist serum & skin is looking better after only a few weeks. Fewer uneven skin spots. I really like this. It's gentle, available @ drug stores, great deal on Amazon subscription plan. I like oil of olay Very good, so far. Works great!! works well very good I use this in combination with the serum. Both made my wrinkles disappear.  I have the laugh lines and lines on forehead. All are gone or barely noticeable. Would surely use this everyday!! Seller sent on time as estimated so loved that too. I got it for my mom. This was her second jar. The first one was from a brick and mortar store. Amazon has the same thing at a great price as always. Evey one's skin is different. If it helps we are of  South Asian descent and it suited her skin perfectly. Love the formula.  The feel and the lovely scent are wonderful! i've ordered this a couple times now and i have sensitive skin but this is a great cream which i even use during the day (it is technically winter) and it doesn't get oily or irritate my skin. i will stick with this one - it makes my skin happy. Great light face cream. I have tried many other moisturizers, expensive ones too and none compare to this one.Others have irritated my skin and were too greasy, this one does neither.All my friends that I have recommended Olay Regenerist to have been very pleased.I highly recommend Olay Regenerist Moisturizer as the go to cream for your face and neck, you will notice a difference. Works Fine. Love this cream! I would have ordered the one with SPF, but it wasn't on the websight yet. After one week I noticed a positive difference.  The color in my skin evened out and looked brighter and less dry.  I use this about every other night before bed.  My skin has all issues you can image and I feel like the wrinkles and age spots especially are diminishing. Great price for a great face cream Only cream I use.. LOVE IT Better price than Walmart.  Arrived as promised. My wife will definitely reorder this again. I know usually ladies use these face cream products but as a man, I couldn't say no to this. My face has always been in a dry and oily state. I have tried many other moisturizing products but none seems to work perfectly. Some of these moisturizing product caused my face to itch and others make my face very oily. Therefore, before any results are seen, I threw them into the trash. When I found this product with many good reviews, I said why not give it a try since winter is coming up as well. I use the cream one time a day after shower and it works like magic. It doesn't create excessive oil on my face or neither does my face have any reaction to it. I can now feel my face smoother than ever without with cause of discomfort. wife loved it.  great deal when purchased! I started noticing in pictures that my skin was looking sallow and I had bags under my eyes even when I wasn't tired :( So I started wearing more makeup to combat this. But then I also started googling, hoping, & praying that there would be ONE product I could use, which would remedy all of the above (yes I'm lazy, and don't like too many steps/products on myself). Tried this out after seeing that it is an Amazon Best Seller and because of its GREAT price. After my FIRST use of this little red jar, I saw the huge difference already! I didn't need concealer under my eyes...didn't need loads of foundation on my face. My [eyebrow] makeup went on smoothly as if I did have foundation on. I don't use this twice a day as directed (just being lazy again); I put it on right after my morning shower. Knowing that my undereye area needs the most attention, I slather it on there thickly first, then commence to applying it over the rest of my face and neck. And sometimes on the backs of my hands. I love this product and will use it religiously. AAAAA+++++++ Wil buy again Women, don't waste your time and money on other expensive department store brands!  After doing so, I always come back to Oil of Olay.  Nothing works better on my acne-prone skin when I use with the micro-sculpting serum and I see results with only one use.  Also much cheaper to buy here than drugstores so save yourself some money by ordering.  Amazing skincare! All is excellent as usual. I had used a sample of a very expensive serum from another company a while back that gave me beautiful results, but I also had to use a moisturizer on top of that and I knew I could never keep up with it.I used this and in the first couple of days the tiny lines started to go away. Okay, fine.  That's what this stuff does.  Then after the first week or so I noticed the deeper lines started to be less noticeable. The ones around the lips and the smile crinkles.  Now, I like my smile crinkles around my eyes. Don't get me wrong, but this sort of softened them.When the deep crevice on the side of my nose that nothing has ever touched (I am a side sleeper. One side. Cheek smushed against the pillow) started to go away, I was hooked. It's been three months and even the scowl lines on my forehead aren't as noticeable.I have been mistaken for being in my thirties!I signed up for the scheduled delivery. Bought this as a gift for my mothers birthday and she loves it! This is her favorite cream and she can't get enough of it! She says it has definitely helped with her skin and makes her face feel great. I look forward to buying more in the future. Absolutely love this product. It's light no scent and really makes a difference on my dry skin Love it My wife really likes this product. She has been using it for years and is a repeat purchaser. I could not find a better price any place else, and the product was exactly as described. I like this cream very much. Like that it is fragrance-free.  I think my skin looks better with use. It feels very light and I like the glow that it gives. I've been using it for years so that tells you how much I like it. Great! I had purchased this quite a while ago because of the excellent reviews I had read.  Unfortunately, back then it was not available fragrance fee, and I broke out from the strong perfume type smell it had.  Now that it is available in a fragrance free version, I tried it again and I am so glad I did.  It lives up to all it's hype.  Goes on velvety smooth, evens my skin tone, mopisturizes with no greasy feel.  Love it! I have always used this product an WOULD NOT DO WITH OUT IT i have recomended it to all my  friends an will always it deserves more than 5 stars :-),,,! I have been using this product and love it!Results seen in 3 days...will definitely be adding this to my skin care regimen. Beats any others I have tried; and the price is reasonable."
B0086668CY," lov It Best lotion I'very used! Excellent product !!! I recommend to my friends and others works great. Smell is awesome. feel is great too Great lotion. I've tried most lotions out there.Sebamed beat them all. That's my opinion. satisfied love this wash. love it. Love this. Wish it wasn't so hard to get. Used to be available everywhere at a lower price point. Love this lotion.  Not greasy at all! Pleasant smell and not over powering.  Lightweight and absorbs nicely. Used to find this at CVS for a little less, can't find it there any more.  Thank goodness for AMAZON! I love this product!  It is not sticky and doesn't wash off right away like so many other lotions do.  It absorbs really well and my hands and nails haven't been in this good a shape in a long time.  I use it on my arms and legs as well and love it. Really helps with very dry skin, even for kids.  Nice clean smell and just the right texture. Use it since college days, 35 yrs ago good, mild cleanser that doesn't dry out my face. Sebamed is the best thing that happened to my skin. Thank you:) Love the smell and it is not harsh. I LOVE this product. I have a few skin allergies and cannot use most washes without having a reaction but this wash is great. It even removes make-up and doesn't feel sticky like some other allergen free brands. Love the Sebamed products. Love this lotion I would like it in a larger sizr. Simply the best non-soap pH balanced wash. It changed my complexion, thoroughly cleaning my pores. Also good for the back with the long type of rough-ish back scrub cloth. This face wash was recommended to me by my doctor back in 2014 for some sensitive skin problems. This has helped my skin tremendously. Highly recommended! This works really well on my family due to sensitivity of our skin we rock with sebamed products arrived on time.been using this product for yearswould recommend it . At my advanced age my skin has become very sensitive. This product was made for me. Wonderful for dry sensitive skin I love Sebamed! Leaves you feeling like you just came from a spa.. for a friend great for sensitive skin Very nice Best soap for skin conditions Good Product!!! Love this stuff - my daughter and I stumbled across SebaMed at Costco and really do not want to use anything else. Hard to find in stores. I order this an oil version for my father who has very dry skin.  Although it doesn't alleviate adding  lotion after a shower, but it does appear to be much easier on his skin. It is not greasy. I am officially addicted to this lotion - SebaMed, you've made the sale!! It's non-greasy, smells decent and gives you that ""feel good"" factor of wearing something not so full of harsh chemicals. In fact I don't even feel like using my stocked up Bath & Body Works lotions anymore!! What happene to the larger size of Sebamed body lotion?,  You show only the 400mi 2 pk.  Let me now  Melvin This makes skin soft and silky.  I put a drop of Glycerin in every pump I use.  It has a light scent.  I am very happy with it. I have been using the moisturizing body lotion and really like it. So, I decided to give a try on this face and body face wash. It smells so good and gentle to your skin. My face felt very refresh and helps me relax when I go to bed. Love it! Even though it’s pricey, a little goes a long way! Would recommend to my friends. Just as expected.  Smells really good.  I add it to my bath water when I bathe and use it in the shower.  Does not dry my skin, feels and smells really good.  Highly recommending. Love these products they are so amazing and I can see a difference in my skin! A couple of years ago I was having serious problems with dry itchy skin. I had tried everything else on the drugstore self and all the lotions and creams seem to make it worse. While in Costco there was a stand set up advertising Sebamed products, so I tried it and was amazed how much the lotion and soap helped my dry skin problem – I have been using it ever since! i love it"
B005I2MP62," Great at cleaning the face in prep for moisturizing.  Great visible results. This stuff really works.  Have been using these for over a year.  Not worried about wrinkles but has prevented skin eruptions.  Cleans very well.  Very pleased. I can't say enough about this great product! Easy to use, effectively removes dirt and makeup, love the textured side to slough my face everyday.  I use it every day and this is perfect for travel.  I cut each pad into 4 and place them into a mini plastic bag; weights nothing,already moist to wash, takes up no space - facial wash and ""cloth"" all in one!  Priced right and arrived quickly, product was as advertised. As others stated, the disks are really large and could easily be cut in half to double the quantity. I removed my eye make up first since they're on the abrasive side to use on delicate skin around the eyes.They clean wonderfully without leaving my skin feeling dry or irritated and they have a mild, pleasant smell. I have sensitive, dry skin so I'm not sure if I could use these daily as I felt a slight tingling feeling upon first use, but I think most people would be fine using these daily. They're not harsh, I just have overly sensitive skin. The price is great as well and I haven't been able to find these in any local stores. With Amazon Prime shipping, they arrived quickly also. Will definitely buy again! This is one of the most effective game changers that I've ever used for my face, neck and chest.  And yes, they can be cut in half because they are so big.  After using one side of the pad to clean your face you just flip to the other side of the pad which is made to remove old stuff.  New skin cells abound and after one solid week of use my skin was clearer, fresher and softer.  Family members and friends were saying how good my skin looks.  I would recommend this product to everyone who wants to get the best out of their skin.  After I've rinsed it all off I use one of the new waters that you use to clean your skin because it neutralizes thing.  Then I always use day and night moisturizers. This is one skin care product i strongly recommend--it is awesome.  Before ordering I read another reviewers suggestion to cut the pads in half to save some $$, and she was right--the pads are big for a single use--half the pad works great.  I will continue to use this product religiously--it really does make a difference with consistent use-and the accompanying moisture/night creams. RoC Daily resurfacing pads were an impulse buy based off a friends recommendation. Upon receiving them, I noticed the container to be wet and smell like cleaning product. Turns out, the seal had broken open so some of the liquid had leaked out during shipping. I was worried, thinking they would quickly dry up, but I have not found any problem with the solution being too dry. Each pad keeps getting  more and more wet as I work my way down the neatly stacked pile of pads inside. The lid screws on, but also has a lift-up tab to use more easily, especially when your eyes are closed after splashing your face before you use one. The smell is nice. One side is smooth and the other has the smallest bumps on it, although both sides feel smooth and I don't consider the 'rough' side to be exfoliating at all. What surprised me about this item is that after I had spent a minute or so scrubbing my face, I opened my eyes and there wasn't any foamy soap or anything. The product is clear. It feels lathered on my face, but there is nothing to see. I know it's on my face, because it stings my eyes ever so slightly when I open them to turn on the faucet. The best part is how nice my skin feels afterward. My face feels very smooth. I've only used this product for 4-5 days, so I can't tell how well it is doing on preventing break-outs, but the texture of my face feels amazing. Leaves skin soft and smooth.  Even as an add-on item, if you buy 3 of them, it's enough that you don't have to really ""add-on"" to any order.  Once you reach $25, it's free shipping! These are great. As stated by others, cut them in half. A half disc is more than enough for a thorough face and neck washing. Love  it have reordered makes my skin feel clean and soft after using. Take off all the make up and re surfing at the same time I love these.  They are a great exfoliating pad and make my skin feel great after I use them. My face is so smooth and clean after using these. Nicely pre-moistened w/ cleanser and just enough texture to be an exfoliator.  I feel squeaky clean after using this. These work great. I cut them in half, as others have suggested. Be careful not to rub too hard or too long in one area, or you can cause an abrasion on your skin. Even though the name says ""Daily"", I use these RoC Daily Resurfacing Disks about three times a week with good results.  I use them on my face, neck and upper chest area.  Clears away all the dead skin leaving a uniformly smooth surface that is ready for my go to moisturizer.  Makes a huge difference on my 64 year old skin.  I hope they never stop making this product. Wonderful. Does exactly as stated. I have used Roc for decades. It's the best Very reasonable price for a product that does so much! I've only been using this product for 2 days, but can see and feel a noticeable difference already! Do cut them in half, as previous reviewers have said. It's plenty to clean your face/neck and will double the value! My face feels super clean, pores are smaller and this product is so easy to use! I'm 45 and looking for products to keep my skin looking good. A+ for RoC resurfacing Disks! I'm impressed! Good Value for a Great Product!  These ROC resurfacing disks are not as rough on skin as a scrub, but still get your face nice and clean and you can tell they exfoliate well.  They are larger discs, so plenty to wash your face then use on your neck ... and anywhere else you want your skin exfoliated. I really love using these. They do as they say, and really clean my face well. I've not noticed any particular overdrying or flaking which I was afraid of. They soap up very foamy and the pads are quite large. I wish I could use one pad more than once so they last longer, but I don't think they are made for that. I've noticed my skin looking clearer and cleaner after using them for about a month. I really liked these. You really only need half the disc-Cut them in half to make them last longer. Very well priced. Easy and pleasant to use. Love them smell and the lather. Cut them in half to make them last longer. Awesome product. I was amazed at how much it really foams. Takes off make up wonderfully and even mascara. After the sceansing my face feels a little tight, so moisturizer is definitely needed. But I love the packaging and it closes tight and doesn't dry out the pads. Definitely inventive concept. Getting more. It's like getting a microdermabrasion facial in a facial cleansing pad. When I first started using it, my face looked red and irritated -- maybe I was scrubbing too hard -- but then I realized how it's like getting a glycolic peel without the peel -- just some redness -- so be sure to wear sunblock. I am thrilled with the results -- I've had not-so-good skin over the years -- but this product, along with the day and nighttime moisturizers, has made the ongoing difference that I had paid megabucks for in the past, through facials and peels that only brought temporary results. Both my daughter and I use RoC because it rocks! I am 60; she is 30. I really like this. It made my face so soft and smooth just after one use. I'm going to order it again as soon as I'm close to running out I love this product,I am seventy years old and look much younger due to caring for my skin.The Roc products are really the thing! Why did I wait so long and try other more expensive products? The ROC facial line ( I have bought the moisturizer; day & night, the sensitive eye and these cleaning disk. I have been using the products for four days, sans the sensitive eye cream and already feel a little improvement in skin texture of my face. ROC is highly rated by many dermatologist and cosmetologists, now I see why.? Love these!  They work great & they remove even eye makeup!!  Will definitely buy again Work very well at removing makeup and tightening the skin. Cut in half to double the amount given. I enjoy the convenience and quality of these Roc facial scrub pads. They are mild on the skin and delightful to use. The product is difficult to find in stores. The flip-up lid is convenience.  I usually scissor all of them in half when I first open a container. 1/2 of a pad is plenty. This product by ROC is the best I've found out of all the other exfoliating disks, pads, or whatever.  Often times, the store will be out of this or that, so I like to order a good supply from Amazon so I don't run out. I just purchased these last Friday - they arrived on Monday. I have been using them for almost a whole week - I am not yanking any chains here; see some improvement on my skin and neck after using these disks. Hopefully the improvement continues! The ROC resurfacing disks come nicely packaged in a sealed plastic jar and are surprisingly large for a facial pad. I have been using these for nearly a month and my skin is already transformed. My pores appear smaller, discolorations have faded and blemishes are no longer an issue.Each disk has a rough side and smooth side, so if you have sensitive skin you can still use these to exfoliate. The foaming liquid that the disks are soaked in has a pleasant smell and there is plenty in the jar to last until the end. I actually have quite a bit left over in the bottom after using all the disks.This product is inexpensive for what it accomplishes! i love it because it works..immediately! Use in conjuction with the Roc CompleteLift Serum. Viola! Notieable difference in skin.I like this product because it does what it says it will do.I recommend this product to Men and Women who want to make themselves look better, care for their skin, and want a product line that works. These cleansing pads are miraculous. It has smoothed the texture of my face, neck and chest. I love it! I loved these disks; it makes my facial cleaning routine a snap. One disk is plenty to clean your face and neck, and I liked the fact that it's double side lets you choose between a deep scrub or a gentle cleanse. It has a pleasant smell and the skin looks great afterwards. It is a good product and will looking to buy more in the future. Arrived as expected from seller. I use these in the morning for a good scrub. Not too harsh. I love roc products, but I can't use them exclusively since I still need something to prevent acne. Ugh. Anyway, these disks are kind of huge; I can do my whole face, neck and chest with one. Might need to cut them in half like others do. I also use a neutrogena exfoliating cream wash, but I actually think this is somewhat more effective. I'm going to alternate them...this one is somewhat more time consuming to use.Update: Okay... I was wrong. These are the freaking amaze-balls super awesome perfect exfoliation product. I mean, this is the holy grail, right here. The price is right, they WORK. My skin looks better than is ever EVER has -- when I use them regularly. For me, maybe 2-3 times a week is enough. The other days I can cleanse with regular old Neutrogena Oil free acne wash or whatever I'm into at the moment. My skin is very acne prone, and this actually is helping to prevent break outs. It's also done WONDERS in improving the texture of my skin-- it looks more fine and smooth, almost like a pre-adolescent's baby face!! I went for some weeks neglecting to use this product and started wondering what the heck I wasn't doing right, because I just kept looking crappier and crappier, and then I remembered these. ONE week back on, I look fantastic again. AMAZING. Like these for the light abrasion and calming scent.Have used these for 2 years. Great product.  Cleans my pores and exfoliates, leaving my skin very smooth. These are great! Not overly harsh, and the discs are large. I cut them in half and there is plenty of soap/suds to clean my face daily. So I can make this jar last for 2 months instead of one without feeling like I'm using less than needed. These have a wonderfully pleasant scent and make my pores look smaller.  They also make your face feel so clean.  I use these normally as part of my nightly ritual and then I put on some Vitamin C serum. Skin feels refreshed after using.  I really like ROC products I have tried many products in the past with so-so results.  RoC is awesome.  The brown rough spots on my face are going away. My pores are smaller and my face has a glow to it.  This is by far the best on the market. Love these disks. Make my skin feel so clean, and healthy. My skin looks better, more glowing. I'm 60 years old, have used for about a year, and will use for the rest of my life. I was very skeptical since I have used ROC products in the past and have been extremely disappointed. I have only been using these for a few days now and all I can say is WOW!  A little goes a long way. My face feels so refreshed and clean after using one of these. The thing that really amazes me is how much lather it has in just one disc. I am able to use one disc for my entire face,neck and chest and STILL have plenty of lather left over. I wish I had a whole barrel of this stuff. Love this product!!! My skin is so smooth now! I love it. I dont have as many break outs and the redness is fading! I like these disk a lot. I do cut them in half to cut down on cost. I have only used this product for about 3 weeks, but my face is brighter and feels smooth. I love these cleansing pads.  They lather up so nicely and gently exfoliate my sensitive skin.  Doesn't leave my skin tight or dry feeling.  After only a few days usage, my skin is notably more clear and less dull. Leaves my skin soft and dewy feeling. I can see why this is ROC's highest rated item and a best seller. These daily resurfacing disks are cost effective and a container lasts about a month if you're using one a day. Some people may try and use this as a makeup remover, but I would dissuade you from doing that--it should be applied to clean skin before toning. The pad is thick and wide, and one side has exfoliating dots that are very, very gentle, whereas the other side is smooth, which I like to use as the final pat down. It smells pleasant and subtle, and I've noticed a brightness to my skin after using this for a few weeks. My skin is firmer and looks more naturally glowy, with less un-evenness. I highly, highly recommend adding this to your routine, especially if you're travelling or have had a long day--it's like a nice mini-facial! I like these disks.  My face feels so clean and smooth after using them.  My complexion is quite clear now, too, though it wasn't that bad to begin with.  I wouldn't go so far as to say it's a miracle, but my skin does feel a lot better: smoother and more balanced. Thank you to the woman who recommended cutting the pads in half! These are wonderful, gentle and softened my skin right away! My pores have started to become less prominent. Extremely happy with this purchase! Since moving to the desert I struggled for 5 years with my skin getting progressively more dry, wrinkly, uneven, just flat out old looking.  These pads cleared up the acne, softened my skin and really I would say have taken years off my skin. One of my favorite products ever. Not really a review, but a tip. If you cut these in half they give you plenty of soap and foaming action and surface area for cleaning your face. They'll last twice as long and work just as well. These make my skin super soft and smooth.  The disks are huge and very foamy.  You can cut these into half or even 4th's to save money without sacrificing having enough to use.  I usually prefer the wipes that do not need rinsed..but these are a lot more cleansing I notice. My skin has recently gone through a lot of changes recently, and I needed a product that would clean well, exfolliate and reduce the appearance of my pores.  I've been using these for a month now, and they do all 3.  I love the two sides of the disk for my combination skin, and even the scent is clean and fresh without being annoying.  I totally recommend these! I have super sensitive skin that is aging.  I initially got this as a free sample and just love it!! It really works and will be using it and the other line products going forward on this 60+ year old skin! big fan of RoC and these did not disappoint! Love the way these pass leave my face feeling clean, smooth and soft! Great product... very easy to use! What a great tool for exfoliating. They really help remove dry, dull unwanted skin and leave a nice smooth texture that is blemish-free.FYI - I cut the disks in half because it will extend your product twice as long and this way works excellent for me. Love the way it makes my face feel. I've used these for a week, and I've had great results already. I keep the jar in my shower, and use them in the morning;  I follow up with my toner and moisturizer. My skin stays very smooth and firm ALL DAY LONG! I love them so much, that I hide them from my teenage daughters. Don't bother buying them from anywhere else, Amazon beats all other prices I've found. Great product :) Awesome product - I will buy again - Love this product. Amazon has the best pricing. I use twice a week and my skin glows. My pre teens were not remembering to wash their faces real well and started to break out.  I put these in their shower and they use them every day and their skin is clear.Wish they came in a larger package as this does not last even a month for one. I love these disks and order them all the time. I use them to ""sand off"" my fine lines. My husband uses them because he has sensitive face skin that often gets dry and red blotches on it. Since using this product we've both seen a great improvement of our skin. My skin is SOOO soft! Daily resurfacing disks are great.  This is one product that I purchase over and over. You can feel how soft and even your face feels using this cleansing pad with the other side as an exfoliant.  I cut each pad in half because I wasted one pad and felt due to the price and the waste of one full pad , cutting them in half works just as good I can't say enough bout the subscribe and save with auto ship that YOU control when it ships and can change or cancel at any time. Now to the product. It's ROC...  said great product, works as stated and gentle on skin. U can cut pad in half doubling ur count because they are so generous with cleanser half a pad is quite sufficient. I found this product to be really helpful in removing my blackheads, much more helpful than AHA-exfoliators. Would definitely recommend. The only weird thing is that the jar is really large, and the disks take only about half the space, a bit misleading I just got these a few days ago, and already my skin is softer and smoother. It cleans off all my makeup, and the softer side is gentle enough for the eye area, and I love the exfoliating side. It's not too harsh either like other products. My only thing I'd change about it, is that I'd make it about 2/3's of the size it is, I tried cutting in half like other reviewers suggested, and it might be just a tad bit small. Other than that, I love it, and I will be reordering this regularly! Seems to do the work.  Seems to make your face feel very clean and some of the fine lines do seem diminished. I love this product, I put a regime on my face to get rid of dark spots and read about this product and thought about trying it. So far great, I can really feel my face smoorther and my dark spots are diminishing (of course with help of other products) but I do see a difference after I started using these. I absolutely Love this product. This leaves my face feeling extremely clean without over drying. I highly recommend anyone who has a  oily t-zone problem to try this. Love these! This is one of my favorite products. The pads are easy to use, and provide a fantastic yet gentle exfoliation. I love this stuff.  My local CVS seems to have stopped selling it and I didn't know how much I missed it.  It was cheaper on Amazon as an add-on.  I even cut the discs in half so they last longer.  A whole pad seems like overkill anyway.  Love these things! Good product. Very good product. I have used this product for about a year and love it.  I have very sensitive skin but I am still able to use this.  I follow this with ROC Deep Wrinkle Repair. I bought this as an add on to get free shipping but it was actually less than I pay for it at Walmart. Another one of my favorite products to use from this line! Never change RoC! While I do have several products I like, this one bumped up the smoothness and quality of my skin another notch.  I give my face a cursory wash first with Cetaphil, which I love, and then use the pad.  I don't end up getting any makeup on it and after one use put it back in the container.  I easily get two, occasionally three uses out of each pad.  I continuously receive compliments on my skin and people are surprised when I tell them I'm 46.  It's inexpensive, particularly when the supply lasts 2-3 months instead of just one.  I definitely recommend.  Be sure to use on your neck and chest too! Easy to use. Could actually tell a difference in my skin and had people complimenting me on it. Need to purchase more just haven't. Good product that stays moist a long time.  I keep in guest bath for less frequent use. What a nice cleanser! I love it. I plan on keeping this as my main cleanser from now on. It has helped me smooth out my skin in just a few weeks. I was feeling some real rough areas on my forehead, now it is smooth again and supple. I love these little pads, My skin seems to like them just as much as i do.  Product is easy to use and the results are outstanding.  Skin looks healthy .  Easy on my sensitive skin as well.  I ran out and could not wait to get more.  This price is even more amazing. The disks are great to use at night before I go to bed. The cleanser in each disk is plentiful - I almost want to re-use them. Good price. Been using these for months now and people compliment how youthful I am. The other day someone thought I was 15 years younger than I am. I love this product for a good cleansing disk to use in the shower.  I have purchased this twice from my local pharmacy.  Amazon offers it at a better price and quick delivery.  Very pleased. Love, love, love these.  I've been using them for a couple of years and never want to run out.  I start everyday using one and they do a great job! These RoC Daily Discs are awesome for erasing those fine little lines that have started to appear.  I use in combination with RoC Daily Moisturizer and am always receiving compliments on my complexion.  I wear very little makeup, and my skin still looks smooth.  Love it! Love this product. These changed my skin for the better. When I run out I notice a difference immediately--skin is rougher and flakes more without these. I cut them into thirds; as is, they are far too big. I do love them too; I noticed a difference in my skin tone very soon after starting to use them. Fantastic product. Use it and my face is so silky smooth. Love it and nice light scent I really like this. I did cut the disks in half like someone recommended. There was still plenty of foam. I am a Roc fan...I use many of their products. My menopausal skin has been giving me issues..scaling..oily..like a teenagers skin but I had never had trouble with my skin. This really makes your skin shine through. Bought 4 more! not so sure of any anti-aging affects, but these are a great scrubbing facial paid.  Soft and Slightly more textured side for exfoliation.  These really clean well and even with a clean face, you'd be surprised at how much dirt these will pull off.. I love these pads!  My face is baby-smooth at 60 years old.  I am cheap and cut them in fourths, which works great! great product, have used many times I like the size of these discs and the fact that there is enough product on each.  They exfoliate well, and don't irritate my skin.  I like the ROC products.  I am 48 yrs old and most people think I am about 35.  Yea! Easy to use. Makes your face feel refreshed and clean. don't get in mouth tastes horrid but I love the product, have noticed a differance all ready, been using three weeks This is a very nice product.  My skin looks and feels very smooth but not too dry after I use this. These are great! As recommended by another reviewer, they are plenty big enough & have enough solution on them that they can be cut in half to stretch your dollar! My skin was noticeably smoother after 1 week of usage once daily. These work great! I can see a huge difference, my skin looks brighter and younger. Cut the disks in half, you will only need half as they lather up really well. I don't usually write reviews but I love this product,my face is smoother and fine wrinkles on my face start to disappear.Will continue to use the Roc products. Great product for cleaning and rejuvenating skin.  I will buy again. you think you're getting a great facial scrub, but it's actually resurfacing! These are amazing little disks, one side soft the other a more loofa. Don't forget your neck! These made my skin so soft. These pads are amazing! I only use 3 times a week and I see a major difference in my face, I get compliments too! I also use the eye cream in this brand and I am in love with it! I'm a repeat purchaser of these cleansing discs. I like them alot. I just keep the jar in the shower stall and use them daily as part of my shower routine.  Couldn't be more simple! great Amazing product! I do not cut these in half as some of the other reviewers have suggested. I find the size to be perfect. I use it on my face, neck and then on my hands. It has made a crazy improvement to my complexion and to my hands.I have already stocked up! My skin tends to be a little dry; these disks are GREAT for cleansing and softening my skin.  I cut the disks in half to make them last longer and they work well that way.  I have been using them for about 3 weeks and my 35+ year old skin definitely looks better. These are great. I've never been huge on face wash and never had any issues with pimples but I use one after a workout and it gets all the sweat off my face and can tell it really cleans out your pores well. Love these things they are the best my skin stays so smooth can't go without them. One of rocs best products. I would recommend for sure. Love ROC.  Does what it says, well. Love this product, great cleansing and gentle, too.  I wish they hadn't removed this as a add on item. Love the product.  Used it for a long time. Have used all the above for years!  Very good! I love these disks. I really think they actually remove sun spots. I don't usually believe in these types of products, though I continue to buy them and try them all. But, I really do notice a difference with these. I tan all the time, am over 40 and definitely see effects from the sun. These disks help reduce the discoloration from the sun. These are amazing resurfacing disks. My skin clears up quickly with regular use. I love these resurfacing disks.  You can scrub on one side, or if you would like a gentler cleaning, use the smooth side. Love this product! I love this product- I use it every day and have noticed such a difference in my skin. I used to use all kinds of face brushes and exfoliating products, but haven't used them since using this. I have very dry skin, and used to have a ""flaky"" appearance. Now my skin looks and feels smooth, which makes my make-up look better. I still use moisturizing serums and moisturizers, but this is the only cleansing product I use. Thank you very much. Sharon Excellent value. For less than $5 per month, I can cleanse, condition and exfoliate my face! These discs are excellent at removing makeup and impurities. The best part is that they are HALF of what they would normally cost at the supermarket or drug store. I'm on my second container and love these discs!  They have a mild scrubbing side and a smooth cleansing side.  And you cannot beat the price on Amazon. my skin always look good using this.  have use roc for years Would purchase again. This is the third month I've used this product and it has noticeably resurfaced my face.  I used it once a day and gently rub the bumps, dark spots  and lines that I've acquired as part of the aging process. After two months it was amazing to me how the bumps diminished, the dark spots and lines also lightened and lessened.  The product did not remove all the flaws, but certainly did smooth out my  skin.  Over my 70 years I've used hundreds of products and other face cleansers did not do the job.  Another plus is it resurfaces but it also moisturizes, not drying at all. Really like it and will reorder it again!! I have a feeling this jar will last awhile! Many people cut their pads in two, I actually do in 4's. For the price and the quality, I'm very pleased! They feel so exfoliating and you know your decreasing fine lines as well. I'm trying to use smart products like these as a preventative method. Thanks RoC.. Just recently started using ROC products, I use this about twice a week along with all the other ROC Resurfacing Products, it helps exfoliate your skin I am S&S on these items and haven't had a delivery for three months, but when I am able to get them I love them! My skin is really noticing the difference in not using one every day. Love this have used it for at least 2 yrs. Works great and is priced well. great Works really well! My skin is smooth, and pores as well as dark spots are smaller. The book How To Look Expensive made me buy this product. I bought it at the beginning of pregnancy when my face was very oily and I was breaking out from everywhere. After about a week, my skin was smooth and soft and I feel like it looks younger and less damaged. Fine lines have really faded away. I now share itwith my boyfriend, he's also addicted to it! These really feel like they help your skin renew. Skill is totally clean and smooth after each use. So practical to take with during traveling too. Light box. I bought this two times it make my face smooth soft some of the pads are not foaming more liquid then the others but  I like it and I will buy more. @ 51 yrs young we need a lil help with our skin,I find this to be gentle enough for everyday use my pores are getting smaller with use I love these facial cleaning discs. Great price too! This makes my face feel great after washing.  I have cut these in half, they are a good size.....so I get double the product. Feels great on your face with no after-effects. Great for anyone with oily skin. As others have suggested, please cut them in half to save more! Great purchase for exfoliating and not too harsh for my sensitive skin. I can use it at least two times a week. This product is great love it love it at it make your skin feels so clean and soft, just bought my first bottle after reading the reviews and must say am very pleased with the result.the cleansing pads,are big enough and don't want it to waste so it cut then in 3 pieces and still good enough that way it will lost abit longer,get my money's worth and don't have to waste it..will surely buy again.. I am a 50-year-old Caucasian female.  My skin type is fair to medium.  I generally have pretty good skin although sun damaged from living in So. California.  I have some forehead wrinkles but not severe.  Very fine eye lines.Over the past few years my face skin has gotten very dry, especially around the cheek area near my nose.  Over the past year I developed a strange rash across my upper cheeks, and across the bridge of my nose.  It is similar to a butterfly rash or Lupus rash.  It also resembles rosacea.  It is dry and has flaky patches.  I have tried numerous creams and soaps to get rid of it, to no avail. (should see a dermatologist)  I have even tried rosacea creams as well as creams for eczema and still nothing has made any difference.  I was about to just give up. I took a chance and ordered this product.  Oh My God!  I have used it three times now, at night at the end of the day.First Night: I cut them in half as suggested by many other reviews and it is definitely enough to use on your entire face and neck,.  It smells very nice and is not overpowering.  It smells clean.  I used the rough side first going over my entire face, including my eyelids!  After about 3 minutes I notice a tingling sensation, which makes me uncomfortable because I'm afraid it is too harsh.  After about another minute using the smooth side I rinse my face with warm water then pat dry with a bath towel.  Then, in about 3 more minutes I can feel my face tighten up.  The first time I was really scared because my skin is so dry anyway and I figured this was going to make it worse.  After the first use, after about 30 minutes, I looked in the mirror expecting the worst and was really surprised.  The redness and rash I have been fighting for at least a year now looked ""calmer"" than usual.  I still wasn't convinced and went to bed.Second Night: Same routine, same tingling sensation, same skin tightening.  Noticed NO drying so far.  Redness and rash is definitely improved.  Also, I NOTICED THE SKIN ON MY EYELIDS IS GETTING LIGHTER!!!!! Something I never expected!  I assumed my eyelids were just stained from so many years of wearing eyeshadow and I just accepted it.Third Night: Same routine, same tingling sensation, same skin tightening.  NO DRYING!  Redness and rash are almost GONE! HOLY COW!!!!!!  My eyelids are almost the same color as the rest of my face!  Never did I ever expect this!!!  My skin feels crazy soft tonight to the point where I don't want to touch it.  I pulled my hair back because I don't want anything to touch it and ruin this great feeling!  My face has NEVER felt this clean, not even with dermabrasion and skin vacuuming treatments.  I'm absolutely shocked that my face has not gotten dry.  I haven't even used any creams and the dry patchy red spots are darn near gone.What the heck is in this stuff????  I am SOLD, after just three uses in three days.  I'll come back in a week or two and do an update but for now I will be buy this over and over again.  I wish I had found it sooner as it would have saved me a ton of time and money and research trying to fix my face skin problems.  I don't know what the heck is in this but it is working for me!!!!  Apparently it is cheaper buying from your local stores, but I like the convenience of Amazon so will order again from here. Great for the skin.  Excellent product. I have a lot going on with the skin on my face. It tends to get oily, I still have breakouts (I'm in my 40's), but some areas get dry patches, in the midst of the oil. Plus, I have sunspots from years of never using sunscreen, lots of wrinkles, and large pores on my nose. I'd been on a quest for years, trying to find a cleanser that gets all the oil off and makes my skin feel really clean, without drying it out. Came across these disks on sale, and fell in love with them after the first use. The cleanser the disks are soaked in is mild enough to remove eye makeup when using the soft side of the disc, but it gets my face super clean. The exfoliating side isn't too harsh, so your skin is glowing, not red and aggravated. Takes care of the dry patches, my sunspots and smaller wrinkles are less noticeable, pores are smaller, and breakouts are almost non-existent. Once in awhile my drugstore runs out of these, so I'm forced to try something different that makes my skin miserable. So, I ordered some from Amazon, cheaper than the drugstore, and with free Super Saver shipping. Two days later they landed on myfront porch. Yea! I use this product once a week.  Like it a lot. I'm cheap so I cut them in 1/2 because they are really too big.  But great results immediately.  LOVE Roc products. I use this product daily.  Like the way it makes my skin feel.  I can really see a reduction in my pore size.  I would recommend. Great product. Every thing meet my expectations. Love this! My face feels so smooth and clean after using these pads. Have only been using for a week but I will definitely keep using these everyday. This was my second order of RoC resurfacing disks and it won't be my last. I really love these things. I use them 2x a day and my skin has never felt or looked better. I have oily skin that's not overly sensitive but tends to dry out with aggressive over-washing/scrubbing. Have had no irritation using these pads. And they're sudsy and fun to use! Have put my Clarisonic in a drawer... Love these! Skin feels clean and still soft ! Cleans and exfoliates great smell is nice I have never used ROC products so this is my first (age 48).  After 1 week use, I am very pleased with the results.  I have combo skin (oily T zone) and this product definitely cleanses and exfoliates.  A few other noteworthy observations:PROS:  Convenient, affordable, effective cleansing pads.  Skin felt softer and smoother, less oily.CONS:  Strong scent (surprisingly fragrant) - I was concerned at first because I have sensitive skin however, I have not had bad experience due to scent.  Drying results - causes my skin to be a tad too dry - which I remedy with a rich moisturizer.SUGGESTION:  These pads are dense and create a tremendous amount of cleanser in each pad so I actually cut the pad in half and extended the jar usage with just as effective cleansing results.  ;) my daughter uses this faithfully Cleans well.  Removes waterproof mascara.  Is my favorite cleanser. This is a good  product for me. I have used RoC products before, but not this particular one.  This stuff is fantastic!  I'm not kidding!  I went to put some wrinkle/line filler in those pesky little lines around my mouth before applying lip stick like I usually do and I noticed I didn't need to use as much.  I did a double take in the mirror.  The lines were smaller and this is the only new product I've added to my beauty regimen lately.  If you haven't tried it, you should.  My skin is fair, and sensitive and I found that this was gentle enough for daily use.  So how, if I can use it daily and it didn't irritate my skin could it be reducing the wrinkles?  I have no idea but I will continue to use it.  Great product! There so easy to use.  I use them in the evening and think they do a great job cleaning your face. great product, I have seen a difference in my complexion within 2 days.  I would definately tell my friends and family about this. My face feels clean after using this product. The cleansing pads do not dry out the skin.  The cleansing pads feel nice on the skin of the face. Aloha,  I just reached 70 and thought I'd better start doing something about these ""freckles"".  Purchased this item because of all the great reviews.  I love it.  I like the fact that there is so much product on each pad as I am able to scrub my arms and legs as well with just one pad.  In just one week i am noticing results and within one day my skin felt firmer- and that my friends is a miracle.  I just purchased more and will likely go on to have it delivered regularly for an additional discount.  Can't beat the price and it works. Works very nicely and leaves my skin soft.  I think it cleans much better than a wash cloth.  A nice cleansing disk. Saw a difference in only one day of using, sounds crazy. I have craters for skin and it really helps film them in. My mom swears that this has decreased her deep wrinkles.  When I first started using it, it made my face very smooth.  However, my skin is too sensitive for it. Use it every night seems to be working skin feelings soft and clean keep using i'll no more as I use it more! After washing my face I wanted to see how much was left behind so I washed my face then used the disk.Woww !!!! It works. The disks gets what regular soap and water doesn't.I highly recommend cutting the disk into. The disks are big and it also makes them last longer. I well forever use them . Very satisfied !!! I really like this product.  The exfoliating disks feel like they really remove old skin and leave you feeling clean and fresh.  I have used one full package and just purchased my second. Really helps remove dead skin. I use it all the time I bought the Dove SkinVitalizer Facial Cleansing Massager and the Exfoliating Pillows are very expensive. The Roc Resurfacing Disks fit on the Dove product and they work amazingly. My skin feels so soft and it gives a deep clean. 19yr old male, black oily face with mild acne scarring. Definitely faded the scars on my face. Took two weeks, I like to use it post work out and I look chiseled for the rest of the day. Can be abrasive if you scrub to hard but never seen so much gunk get off my face. Can use it after apricot scrub and it'll still manage to remove some gunk. Excellent Love it I keep a supply of these disks.  It seems to be the only product that keeps my face clean! i am 54 years old and starting to see wrinkles and dark spots. This has really worked to make me feel like I have younger looking skin This product removes rough skin.  Is Gentle and I feel my face is really clean and smooth after every use. Good I like all the ROC products. I had never tried this and really like how clean and smooth it leaves my skin Love these!  Take off more makeup even after you have washed your face and think it is clean!  I order 3 at a time!  3 months supply! I use these pads every day and my face feels and looks so nice. After using it, I feel so much cleaner. You don't get that with just  using soap! Great facial and amazing product! I like them a lot! They are scented but it's not overpowering and they easily remove any eye make-up I put on. Like other reviewers, I cut them in half. You do have to wet your face and rinse off the lather, which another reviewer actually had a problem with?!? For $8, just give 'em a try. Love it. i use it three times a week in the shower to help scrub my face.  It feels wonderful!!  I have bought it several times and have it on my reorder list! Wonderful product, and is a lot cheaper at Amazon. I am so glad I discovered what savings I can get on my Roc products through them. I love the 2 sided pads, smooth and textured, filled with a beauty cleanser. The flip top design of the canister keep the pads moist so never dry out. You will see a difference in your skin texture as I did.  I would not use any other cleanser on my sensitive skin. I would recommend this product for those of us who are a little lazy about exfoliating. I am in my late thirties and have spent a lot of time in the sun. Thus, I need to exfoliate frequently. These discs are effective without being harsh, they are convenient to use and I am so happy with the results, I will continue to use the product and other Roc products in tandem. I'd always wanted to try Roc products, however, I wasn't willing to gamble what I considered a high price for a drug store product. After using Roc products, I feel now that the price point is excellent, as these products are comparable or BETTER than some department store items I've tried. I definitely see a difference!  I don't have a lot of fine lines yet, I'm using this as preventative, but the few I do have are reduced after just a few weeks.  I love the way my skin feels and looks, and I notice my pores definitely look smaller.  Amazing results for the price! I plan to write a review again in a few weeks, but after just ONE use, my skin is softer & smoother than ever!I also recommend doing what another reviewer did: cut these discs in half, as they are large enough to do so & will last that much longer. These cleansing pads are amazing!  They leave my skin very smooth.  I use many ROC products and for the price these really are great value.  They are large, I cut them in half to get more days out of them. I've been using ROC Resurfacing  Disks for about 2 years now.  They really clean my face well and removes all makeup residue.  I have never had a breakout with them and I think my skin is brighter. My skin does feel a little tight and dry afterward but I follow up with the ROC moisturizer.. The are a bit drippy and messy so I use then in the shower every morning. I have been using this for a week now and I can already see the differences.  Even my husband noticed how much tighter and better by skin looked (and he didn't even know I was using this product).  You will regret not trying this! Great product very satisfied This is a perfect product that really works. It always makes my face feel so creamy smooth and my skin is firmer. I'm very impressed with this product as it does just what Amazon says it will do. Great product and great place to buy it at. A recent convert to ROC products (who can beat the results with a fantastic price?) I purchased these after reading other reviews.  They are wonderful with a rough side for exfoliating and a smooth side for extra facial cleansing.  I don't use them every day, but they are great for deep cleansing in the shower.  Will keep buying for as long as I can find them...LOVE the results I am seeing with ROC moisturizers and creams...best skin I have had for years! Good So far I really like this product. The textured side seems to cleanse my skin without being to abrasive and the smooth side is great around delicate eye areas and removes my mascara as well. This is an awesome product.  Only caution is that you keep it away from your eyes; it burns like crazy! I use ROC's nighttime moisturizers and their eye cream and decided to try the Resurfacing Disks.  They smell fresh and clean and they are huge.  At times I have cut them in half.  One side of the pad is more textured and the other side is smoother.  A great product. Good product Best resurfacing product out there.Results instantly, smoother skin, more refined and less wrinkles.Would highly recommend to everyone.Try It Now. I love this product! I use it everywhere and I have sensitive skin. It's a definite must in my medicine cabinet from now on. Clean my face  very well and at the same time moisturize my skin.  My face looks healthy after I used  it.  Leave a nice sensation  of cleanness. I feel refresh and more youthful.  i really love it. Love these face daily resurfacing disks. Makes my face tingle and feel really clean. I learned from another review to cut the pads in half. That is all you need.  Do I look younger?? To me yes but maybe no. My skin is glowing. I also use the day cream and night cream for my face. The day cream has SPF 30 which is a plus. I will keep buying  Roc products. Plus my Dermatologist who I see every 3 months for precancerous lesions says it is a good product to use. That made it official to me. I searched a long time for a product that would not cause an allergic reaction on my face.  I have very sensitive skin...dry with occasional break-outs.  These disks do not irritate my skin the way most products do.  Most of the time, I end up with red splotches and flaky skin when I try something new.  The disks caused no issues at all.  I read the reviews prior to purchasing this product and followed the suggestion of cutting the disks in half.  I also remove eye makeup before washing my face with the disks.  I only use them only 1x/day to avoid excessive dryness or irritation.  This product does exactly what it says: resurfaces.  My skin was beginning to show some superficial signs of aging (in my late 20s).  These disks are like magic- the way they smooth the surface of my skin and leave a fresh glow...I can even use them in my eye area!  My skin was baby-soft after only a few days of using them.  Any signs of aging are diminished.  When I apply a foundation or tinted moisturizer, I am able to get very even coverage and a flawless finish, thanks to the smooth texture of my skin.  I would recommend these to anyone, any age.  This is a great product and the price is a steal when you consider the dramatic results.  I've used products 8x the price with a less successful outcome.  I will be ordering this product on auto-ship. This product is the best of it's kind and you don't have to spend a fortune to get a spa-quality exfoliation done on your facial skin. I have somewhat dry skin that can be sensitive if treated too harshly by products or too much abrasion. If used in the right frequency (I'd say no more than twice a week is all most women should need if you moisturize your skin properly in the morning and evenings), this product is PERFECT. Also, the pads are HUGE and unless you have a face the size of Shrek, you'd be throwing your money away by using a whole one. I cut them into quarters...tried thirds at first and still had too much. But 1/4 of a pad is plenty to exfoliate my facial area each time. I pre-cut a bunch of them at one time and replace them in the jar so they are ready to go. Just be sure to keep the lid on tight so that they don't dry out...I'm not sure that you'd ever be able to get the right ratio of liquid back in by adding water. After doing my exfoliating treatment with these (and rinsing/drying), I immediately moisturize my face using a serum type moisturizer so it can really soak into my skin immediately after all the dead skin is removed. My skin just glows. If you see a lot of redness after using these, you might be scrubbing too hard...try easing up a bit. You shouldn't have to use much pressure at all. Good luck! My skins feels completely smooth and clean after using these, but they're very gentle. These disks are a great buy for the price.  They really do leave your face feeling smooth and clean.  I would definitely order these again. The 5 stars are true.I have been using this for the last week:)I am happy I found this product.The pads are 2 side useable and the are more than enough..I cut them in 3 lol.I have a small face.my skin is very dry but I get rashes very easy.I was concerned since I was having a breakout when I got them.I made my self courage and started.There is a little stingy feeling after I use it but it is worth.I use retin-a 20 min after the pads.I never use the rougher side because I have sensitive skin.Use the instructions never to dry ur face by wiping but by padding gently with a soft towel(gently press or if possible let air dry)my pores are smaller and my expression wrinkles are almost gone.I am 30 btw:)I hope this helps because I am very thankful to all the 5 stars that helped me choose this product.Happy cleansing!! Most amazing daily resurfacing pads ever. Target stopped carrying them so started purchasing on amazon. Cheap and easy. Love it, love the product. I love this product Great I usually forget/ don't feel like cleaning my face in the evening. this product is so complete that it makes it very easy to use and it just makes me clean my face. The pads are ready to use on the face and after I finish ""scrubbing"" i just wash them and use them to get the soap of my skin. Glad i got it. Highly recommend this product really works. Good price and high quality! After using my skin is clear and soft. Very very good! I purchased this produce at My wife's require and She Loves' it,.Thanks again amazon team for making this item available thru you market place,. these are great for my face ...they clean my face so well. Beautiful fresh fragrance.  Skin feels thoroughly cleaned after you use it.  I'm very happy to be able to use the soft side to remove eye makeup. These smell great!  I love how smooth my skin feels after using them. There is actually quite a bit of product on these, and the disks are large.  I was able to get away with cutting them in half and making this tub last twice as long. This is a wonderful product and I really like it and the results are amazing. You can actually see your pores getting smaller daily delivering a smoother surface. I've been use this product for a year, and really like how my face feels afterwards.  It is not dry or irritated.  I cut the disk in half; which is sufficient to clean my face and remove all makeup.  Only negative, is the jar is so big. Absolutely marvelous works wonders! Does exactly what it says, I'm a tough rater but this is one of my all time favorites!!! I needed a product to perform resurfacing on my face because I had indentations from a bad combination of acne and a magnifying mirror, if you get my drift. It used to be fine that I would pop my zits, but now I'm in my mid-20's now and I've begun to notice permanent damage when I mess with my skin.I did notice a difference in the indentation scars after using this product for a month. In combination with scar cream my face looks better, although the indentations are still there, just not as noticeable. I'm really relieved to have a product that can reverse some of the damage I've done. Thanks RoC! Excellent product for my red,sensitive skin this winter.  I cannot use ANY scrubs on my face as they are way too abrasive for my rosacea;  this, however, does the trick leaving my skin super soft & glowing! I am just finishing my 2nd jar of these discs. I just signed up for auto delivery because it's the cheapest way to do it. These exfoliate very well and prepare your skin to absorb your other creams and lotions. I stopped using them for a little while and noticed a difference right away. Learned my lesson and I'm back. I'm a fan of all the ROC products, just wish they were cheaper. I have not used a lot of facial cleansers and this one is so easy and leaves your face feeling soft. I need to order more. I really enjoy using these! The scent smells really good and isn't too strong. I will use the non-textured side to wipe away my eye makeup and brows (it will sting eyes if not careful) and then use the textured side for the rest of my face to get the mini exfoliation.What's also great is that these discs can be cut in half to extend your use. There's a lot of product in just half a disc. Once I complete my face (I usually do this in the shower) I'll wipe my elbows to get some exfoliation there too.These are great! I just love the convenience of this product.  It comes with 60 large pads, but I cut them in half to make them last longer.  I did notice the company changed the design of the top.  It used to have a ""flip top"" and now it is just a screw on top.  I don't like that change at all and I'm happy I kept my old container because I use that one instead of the new one because I like the flip top much better. I have been pleased with every RoC product I have tried, and these disks are no exception. They are like the Cadillac of disposable make-up removers/ skin cleansers, a far cry from the thin little towelettes in the plastic pouches I have tried before. Each thick pad is thoroughly saturated with cleanser, they foam up nicely, and the soft side is gentle enough to use to remove mascara and eye make-up, while the textured side invigorates and refreshes like a mini facial. Now that I am getting older I have developed a keen appreciation for skin care, and this is one of my top five products I would recommend to anyone who wants to keep their skin looking its best. Excellent! I love the Roc resurfacing pads! I love these, it leaves your face smooth and very clean, I am getting ready to order another jar.  The smell is great too. My face is clear and super soft. Love this product! Its easy to use. Wet pad and get to cleaning. I leave it in the shower. This is a very good product for a great price. Huge disks which I cut in half when I use it. Purchased these for the first time. After just a few days they have made a difference.  They make my face smoother and cleaner and I can visually see the effects. This product has reduced the size of my pores as well as helped to remove bumps and redness on my skin.  It is a great product and I use the subscribe and save! I am a 32 year old acne prone African American female. I have very sensitive skin, this did not break me out or irritate my face at all. It seems like my pores look smaller and smaller with every use. I would and will buy again in a heartbeat. Not sure why people say half a pad is enough? I use the pad over my face, neck, chest and hands! Works fantastic! Makes a huge difference with my skin! Received it in a timely manner. Creates a lot of suds and is reusable. I remove my makeup first and then use the disk....at least three separate times.  It says, to use once but save your money and use it again, and again. I just started using it so can't tell you how well it works. Would recommend it to anyone. These cleansing pads are great! Great quality and thickness too! I agree with all the other reviewers that stated they cut their pads into smaller pieces merely because they are HUGE and u definately do not need a whole pad to cover your face! I found that quarter of a pad works just fine for me!The smoothe side lathers very very well and the textured side exfoliates great! It feels like a facial scrub actually and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth the instant u wash it off.After the use of my first pad I INSTANTLY saw brighter skin. My face feels sooooo clean I love them.... I've only just started using them so I will have to upload pics after a few weeks use. But so far I love Rock Daily Resurfacing Discs and I will be back to update soon. Love this!!  Leaves my face feeling really fresh, and does a great job getting off the dry skin... Will order again"
B00IJESQUK," Nice smell! I love it!!!❤️ Will order more These Aveenos cleansers are the best! This is the only wipe I use because it doesn't irritate or leave a foul smell. It works wonders and as expected, unlike others which I have sampled.I suggest you talk to family and friends when it comes to products you want to try. This is how I came to Aveeno, my daughter had some and I tried one, it worked great so now I stock up from Amazon where I have gotten the best price. The first thing I noticed when I opened this product was the fragrance. I loved it. It was a very soothing, fresh, and calming scent. The fragrance lingered for a while after I used this prouct, which I liked.

I buy packs of these at a time. Quick and easy. nice sized towelettes.  Has a really nice scent and my skin feels good after using them.  Doesn't dry my already dry skin.

They also smell great and I love the scent. When I get home after a long dayI wipe my face with avenno wipesFace feels good I get compliments on my complexion all the time. I have tried cleansers of every brand and pricepoint. NOTHING comes close to these amazing cleansing pads. Makeup comes off and face is clean and moisturized! DONE! Excellent product. Have been using for two years as it takes my bathroom water too long to warm and we have been in drought for over two years. I like thes for hime and travel, love the way my skin feels? Wish they were not so pricey and not sure you can recycle. I don’t usually have the time nor take the time to write reviews about anything but this product is really great. Best make up remover ever! I love Aveeno products and always used their facial wash to take off makeup. This is so gentle that you don’t have to use a washcloth and pull on your skin and it’s great for taking off mascara and eye make up etc. Have tried other make up removers and this one is the best by far!

It doesn't dry out my skin like I've experienced with other brands, and it has a nice, gentle scent. My skin feels soft after removing my makeup, which is a plus! I also appreciate the small size of the package they come in. I can easily take these on trips without worrying about taking up too much room. This product works wonderful.

I love this wipes. Makes my skin glow and have a cucumber, aloe scent. Leaves your face feeling so good. I've tried a lot of wipes and these are in my top three. Does the job for everyday makeup. The wipes have a pleasant, clean fragrance and their texture is just right -- just rough enough to gently exfoliate, yet gentle enough not to redden or sensitize skin.For long wearing foundation and/or tough Japanese sunscreen days, I still double cleanse using DHC Deep Cleansing Oil Mini, 3 Pack and a light cleanser. But honesty, at the end of most days I am exhausted and just want to wipe my face and that's it. I follow this (and any other cleansing wipe) with a toner (either Cosrx Aha/bha Clarifying Treatment Toner 150ml or lately Andalou Naturals Clementine Plus C Illuminating Toner, 6 Ounce - which is not necessary if you only use cleansing wipes occasionally.Despite these being better at removing makeup than most other wipes, I still see residue of foundation when I wipe with toner on a cotton round (this doesn't happen when I double cleanse with DHC + Cleanser, btw)In conclusion, these are not perfect at removing everyday tinted moisturizer and blush. HOWEVER, they are inexpensive, smell nice and have a nice texture so I am giving the 5 stars and will likely repurchase. This makeup remover works really well and leaves my face smooth and clean. Best makeup remover towelettes I’ve ever used. Great makeup removers. Best makeup wipes EVER!! Great for sensitive skin. Great makeup remover - use every day. thee best makeup removal wipes! I've got my friends to also used these as well. My favorite make up wipes Great product not only wipes away makeup from the day, but wipes away grease and smells amazing. Love these wipes Love these. They remove all make up, and leave skin feeling soft and moisturized will recommend it and continue to buy. Love these clothes. They remove all makeup and leave my skin feeling so soft. Yasss kween! My skin always feels fabulous after I use these makeup removing wipes. I use these before bed or pop em' in the gym bag to use after a long workout (they feel so fresh on my skin!). The wipes come in a resealable package that ACTUALLY stays closed and keeps your wipes fresh! And you want to keep these babies fresh because well, the scent? It's ahhhmazing. (Okay, I think I might enjoy the smell a little too much)My skin? It feels great. I can start seeing some of the darker spots that were on my face start to fade after 2 weeks of use. (I have faith I will have flawless skin one day!). What makes me feel good about using these though, is that they feel so soft and moisturizg but they can also wipe away the toughest under eye makeup I've got in my makeup case. GG Aveno. Firstly , I don't wear makeup but I am a makeup wipe lover and I need to have them as part of my skincare routine. I've used all kinds and these are one of the best I have used..(epielle and olay are amazing! Ponds,neutrogena+garnier too) These makeup wipes are absolutely amazing!!!! I had just barely got them One-two days ago and have used about three - four wipes only as I use two in the morning and two at night...+ whenever I feel I need one..I am already seeing such a huge improvement in my over all skin!! I had to share this info because I'm in shock , wow! If you are not sure or are deciding between wipes I'd advise you to go with these. I'm so glad I stumbled upon these when I was in desperate need of wipes..oh, the smell? Amazing as well as the way they work for your skin! Don't worry the scent does linger but it also doesn't burn your eyes, so if you wear eye makeup it shouldn't be a problem.. I've used them all over my eye skin to the inner corners as well! These are not just to remove makeup, it isn't just a wet towelette obviously.. Now lemme tell you a little about my skin.. I have struggled with acne that would never seem to leave my forehead area and sometimes cheeks as well as side of my face... As a result I've had some acne scars but they always go away eventually after time (+help from lovely water) .. But my forehead is the main trouble area and I've had acne scars here more than anywhere and they'd leave and appear because well the acne never left ..just when I thought yes their disappearing, I'd gain more from the previous Forever staying acne and the process would start over and go on and on..I'm surprised no one has left a review commenting on their skin esp since the wipes target a lot of skin problems people have..but maybe they have normal skin.. But anyways thanks to these little wipes,my skins acne over my forehead is already disappearing , believe it or not! I barely do haha..so are the acne scars I recently developed on the side of my face, they are lightening quicker than I thought. Oh and again, about the wipes, they don't leave your skin looking flaky and dry after the moisture from the wipe dries into your skin or leaves it...I'm in love and these will probably be my go to wipes from now on whenever I can get them... They're not too pricy either so not bad for all that it claims it does for your skin+ it actually being true& working! I call these miracle wipes now lol! Sorry if this is unorganized or all over the place with the details but I am so excited about these as you can tell...I was thinking about bulleting this to make it better to read and organize it better halfway through but  If you have any question I'll answer !! Thanks Love this item.  Give my skin such a wonderful glow! I love Aveeno Positively Radiant Makeup Remover sheets.... It feels soft and smells great!! The only makeup remover that makes my acne better. I LOVE how it smells and feels on my skin. I only use this makeup remover :) thanks I love this product! I haven't found a more gentle and effective product. It makes my skin feel refreshed and healthy. THE BEST, hands down. I did a test of Simple (horrible...you need an Aveeno to get off the makeup Simple leaves behind), Aveeno, and Neutrogena (better than Simple, but not as good as Aveeno, leaves less make up behind, but doesn't get it all, and it dries out faster in the package than Aveeno.) Aveeo beats them all! Best at removing all make up, stay moist the longest. No comparison. (I decided to do the comparison test when Costco switched from carrying only Aveeno to carrying only Simple and was so disappointed with Simple. They have since switched from Simple to Neutrogena… I guess they're giving them all a try, but the Aveeno is far better, hopefully they will go back, because it's cheaper to buy the three pack at Costco.) nicely refreshing I purchased this product as asked by National PR Team to review.The product arrived very fast. I do not use make up, so i asked my sister to review it for me. and this is what she had to say.  The Aveeno Positively Radiant wipes are overall a great product.Having sensitive and dry skin, I often suffer of break outs and hives after using similar products, however, after using these my skin felt soft and I did not get any of the negative effects I do with the competitor.Things to note:The wipes stretch, making it easy to cover the whole face and to use it extensively without it ripping, like other brandsIt takes all heavy makeup off with only one wipe and without much effort, rubbing, or pressing against the skinThe smell is great, but not irritatingLeaves skin feeling fresh, soft and cleanCleans beyond makeup, and take accumulated dirt and oil from any part of the body, even if it's not it's initial intent.They hydrate the skin, in fact, even cracked lips have improved in my time using these wipesLeaves skin bright and shimmery.The best product of it's kind! Love these! The smell is amazing, not too overpowering. It's a floral smell, not like the wet wipe smell. I like to use a couple of these on my face when I travel. They get most of the makeup off, but there is always some makeup residue (not bad though).The pack stays pretty fresh, I had one pack for about six months and it was still good!There are quite a few wipes in there too! I love it.I want to try some other brands because I get sick of smells after a while, but I just keep coming back to these. These are my new favorite make-up removing wipes. They stay moist long enough, have a very pleasant aroma, and remove the most make-up of any of the others I've tried. good cleansing and yet leaves your face feeling great....the cost is very good! Removing your makeup properly is the first step in a healthy skincare regime - and Aveeno ""Positively Radiant"" Makeup Removing Wipes do just that in one quick and easy, deeply nourishing wipe!I would absolutely recommend this product for the following reasons:No Residue:Some makeup removers leave a film that not only clogs pores - but also prevents skincare products from fully penetrating the skin and working their magic. Aveeno wipes are soap-free, oil-free, and leave no such residue.Gentle But Effective:A down-side to many wipes is that they just spread the makeup as you're removing to other parts of your face - so you end up with foundation in your eyes and mascara streaks on your cheeks! Aveeno wipes' lightly textured surface eliminates that challenge by lifting away dirt, oil, and makeup (even waterproof mascara) off your face and onto the wipe.5 Factors of Radiance:The ""Positively Radiant"" collection is uniquely formulated to target all 5 factors of radiance - tone, texture, dullness, blotchiness, brown spots. In less than a week, my skin was looking smoother, fresher, and more radiant. Aveeno's combination of moisture-rich soy extract with gentle cleansers nourish and deeply hydrate overnight. You literally wake up to better skin - just by removing your makeup with these wipes!Hypoallergenic and Non-Comedogenic:Aveeno's mild formula is gentle enough for everyday use even on sensitive skin.Makeup wipes often burn your eyes, but Aveeno wipes are gentle enough to use around my eyes and contact lenses - and no stinging over blemishes.The only recommendations I would have for Aveeno are:• A fragrance-free option for those extremely sensitive to scents/perfume• Perhaps a larger size towelette for those who wear lots of waterproof or heavy layers of makeup• More convenient packaging with a flip-top lid that dispenses wipes versus the peel/stick type Ok, I don't wear makeup but I do work with my hands and I constantly get grease and grime on my hands. I don't know how they do it but these wipes are great getting my hands clean of the dirt and grease. In fact it does a better job than some of the industrial pumice hand cleaners I've used. My wife and daughters love the stuff. They tell me that it works great removing makeup and leaves their skin feeling soft and clean. The girls also use it after hikes and working out. And we all love the scent. Highly recommended for the whole family. Hope this helps. These wipes are awesome! I was skeptical that they wouldn’t be able to take off all my makeup because at first touch they are not overwhelmingly wet but one wipe actually cleaned my entire face. Even my mascara came clean off and I usually put two layers on. They have a really nice smell to them too. My face felt fresh and clean after using one with no greasy or residue type of feeling after! Definitely recommend these!!!! I used to always buy the blue pack of the Neutrogena makeup removing wipes, although they did the job, they always left an oily residue on my skin and left it feeling not clean. Although these are a bit pricey, I took a chance on these since I've used Aveeno products in the past and was happy with them. These wipes are great, not only do they remove all the makeup but they also have such a pleasant scent to them and leave my face feeling clean but not dried out. I'll be sticking with these from now on ☺️ These daily exfoliating wipes are super convenient. I use them every night before bed to clean my face of makeup quickly, completely, & easily. They have a light fresh scent; and are a generous size, ensuring complete makeup removal. The wipes are soft in texture and gentle on the face; leaving my skin soft, clean, even-toned, and best of all-- hydrated after each use. This product really works with my sensitive skin; I do not experience any redness or breakouts; and I love that my skin brightens up and keeps an even tone after use. Highly recommended! I love these things. I used to use Aveeno lotion on xorton pads to remove makeup but these make it super easy and aveen is so soft on my skin. I've been subcribed to these for a long time.Please note I don't use waterproof makeup so I'm not sure if it works well for that!Can be used easily without a mirror to successfully remove makeup :)Great buy! Aveeno Makeup wipes are simply outstanding! I got these for my girlfriend who complains about how other makeup removers don't ever work well and she is thoroughly impressed with these wipes. They remove all makeup as well as any grease or oil that releases from the skin pores due to all the makeup. They smell good, almost like a hint of flower scent I believe and have the perfect amount of moisture in the wipes. The packaging is very well done and has a great look to it, very eye catching from other wipes. I would recommend these to anyone who hasn't had a good past with makeup removers because these are definitely top of the line. I love these makeup wipes! I use both Clinique and Kat Von D makeup, so I was a tiny bit skeptical as to whether or not this product would work with those, but they do! Even when I do a heavy ""kat eye"" look with long eye liner wings I still only need one Aveeno wipe to remove ALL of my face makeup. I've never had to use more than one. The formula feels good on my skin, it doesn't sting, and it smells great and refreshing! I don't feel oily after using one at all. Afterwards I go ahead and use my Clinique three step and call it a night! Give these a try - they're awesome! I love these wipes! Though I would love the lotion too, but I don't! The good thing is these leave my face feeling moisturized and I LOVE the scent. These are the best facial cleanser/makeup remover, that leaves your skin smooth and clean.  I have been using these for several years. My favorite cleaning wipes and I've tried almost every brand on the market.Nice and thick and leaves my face and neck feeling clean and refreshed without the harsh burning feeling that so many other wipes I've used have.Also the sturdy plastic seal on the packet prevents the wipes from drying out; such a pet peave that leads to big waste of money.Highly recommended! I really like these. Very light fragrance and doesn't irritate my skin. I see others complain about the fragrance but I love it! Makes my face feel so fresh & gets my waterproof eye products off easily! Great for sensitive skin! Does a great job. Good size sheet. Does the job well Love it. These are my favorite cleansing cloths. By far the best makeup wipes I’ve used. My skin feels fresh and clean. I have dry and irritable skin, but these wipes never made me break out and didn’t leave my skin feeling dry or right AT ALL. Highly recommend As far as I can tell it's getting the job done! I absolutely love the smell! The best make up remover I love it This product is great for dry skin and takes my makeup off exactly the way i want to when I use a wipe. I love it. I have sensitive skin and this works very well. I use it every night! Love this product. I can take off my eyeliner with it and the wipes never bother my eyes. Worked really well on all kinds of makeup and smells amazing! Great Product.  I can purchase it at a better price at my local grocery store and do.  I also cut the cloths in half and store them in an airtight porcelain container as a full cloth is never needed.  Use in the morning and at night.  Moisturizing! Awesome for make up / eye makeup remover.  I have acne prone sensitive pale skin and these are non acne causing and great smell."
B06XZVZXWC," This set worked well as advertised and I was happy to see it is mainly made of natural ingredients. I guess the bottles are travel size.Regarding my experience, I only required a tiny bit of wash to take care of my face. Hence, the bottle size was not an issue. Folks with sensitive skin may want to avoid the toner (step 2) which it feels like a citric formula. The toner is on the stronger side especially if you do not follow the instructions (as me). You are supposed to put a bit in a cotton pad. The moisturizer was great to mattify my skin. I have oily skin in my T zone of my face and slight acne. When I started working out last month it got worse. So I wanted to try something to help fix this. I picked it mostly for the oily skin help. That it has helped with greatly. Also my acne when it does break out is a lot smaller than before using this product. I am glad I started this and plan on sticking with it. I really notice how oily my skin can be when I miss doing it in the morning or evening. The first step smells wonderful, this is my favorite scent of the three. I have been using this oil control system for about 10 days now and I am very happy with the product! My face has always been on the oily side because I am Italian, and it causes my makeup to run off my face and makes me look shiny in a not-so-nice way. Since I have been using this system, I have really begun to see a difference in my skin! I don't look shiny throughout the day like I used to, I don't feel so yucky throughout the day and have to apply less powder to keep my skin looking matte. The cleanser feels great and smells good when I was my face, and the toner is so refreshing. The lotion really helps my skin look and feel smoother and better all day long! I have tried different systems in the past with little effect, so I think I finally have a winner! This worked great! I workout a lot so I tend to get quite a bit of acne from my sweat. But this helped clear it up and keep it under control. My husband uses it too on his chest and shoulders where he gets acne from working out and he loves it as well! We will purchase again once we run out. Oh and it has also helped my face so much from being oily. Most days by after lunch my skin is shiny and oily through my makeup, but using this system has helped a lot! I have spent lots of money on all kinds of acne mess for my daughter over the years. We have tried multiple prescription mess even and by far, this has worked best. She has oily skin that is prone to bouts of acne. She has used this daily as recommended for about 2 weeks now and her skin hasn't been clearer in months!  She is very happy with this and so am I! I am really glad to have found this product line because I am trying to get away from products with chemicals in them.  This kit really does a wonderful job of keeping my skin under control and I love the way my skin looks and feels.  I care about what I put on my skin and am definitely not going back to chemically loaded products again. I got this for my 16 year old daughter.  She is developing acne which I think is due to her eating more junk food.  She tried this three step process and has had great results in only a few weeks.  Her skin is not oily anymore.  The blemishes have gone away for the most part.  She is thrilled to see the results and so am I. Extremely effective and easy to use acne kit. Three steps to clear skin. I noticed a difference within 3 days. Left my face feeling fresh, clean and less acne. I love that this is an all natural way of clearing up acne. No harsh chemicals yet highly effective. It has a light scent that is not offensive. It is actually very pleasing and am happy with this great set. Easy to use, no chemicals and highly effective. It does not leave you face dry which is a plus for me since I hate that feeling. Very very happy with this Oil Control Acne Kit. This has been helping me with my cystic acne as well as black and white heads.  The cleanser needs only a drop and theres plenty of suds.  The toner seems like it will go faster than the cleanser since its the same size and you cant use just one drop.  The lotion is the piece de resistance and does much of the clarifying -but its smaller than the other bottles (my only complaint!)I use a regular cleanser once a day and use this at the opposite time. I purchased for my wife and i must say this have earned me alot of brownie points. It works great foe clensing her skin and makes it  easier to carry in her cosmetic kit because of such a small size. Very good product Absolutely amazed at how well these products worked. I was a little worried it might not work or break me out and I was completely surprised that it didn't and that it actually helped. Very happy I am 28 years old and still struggle with acne. I've used every over the counter face soap and acne treatment, nothing ever helps. I ordered this because of the great reviews and relatively decent price and I am happy to say within three days of use my skin is actually clearing up!! I would definitely recommend this stuff 3 easy steps to control acne and oily skin. My hormonal 14 year old is so happy about the skin change he has noticed over past 2 weeks of regular everyday use. Oily spots and breakouts have faded. Not harsh on the skin and leaves skin feeling so clean and refreshed. This is great stuff!  I didn't realize at the time of purchase that I was ordering a small travel size set but the results are wonderful!  I need to find out how to get larger sizes of all of it!!!  The products are amazing & I will absolutely order more! I like the way my skin is becoming using this kit.It is so soft and gentle.Thanks Reduces oil really well. I have very oily skin I suffer with really oily skin and have tried numerous products in all price ranges.  I guess there really is not a cure for oily skin but I find this set to help considerably.  I like it because for one, it’s natural and all the products smell really good and most of all I am seeing results.  I am very happy with my purchase. I bought this for my pre teen daughter with oily skin. We have tried EVERYTHING, this product is the only thing we have used that works.It is expensive but totally worth it. It doesnt dry out your skin but does get rid of excess oil. Product really does work. My skin is very oily and it has tamed it down drastically. Do recommend ! I've been using this 3 step acne and oil control system for 2 weeks and I am amazed at the results I have got, not just from clearing up my adult acne- but my large pores have decreased tremendously in size as well. I 100 % recommend this to anyone struggling with acne and clogged pores. I will definitely be reordering. It smells nice, works decently well for my acne and the price is reasonable. This kit has been a big help for my oily skin.I especially like the moisturizer since it seems to really do the job and keep me shine free throughout the day Really nice product. I haven't had any breakouts from using it, which is good because I have sensitive skin. It smells nice too which is nice. Since I've been using these product my skin is less oily throughout the day! I would definitely recommend. Smells good, a sorta citrusy scent, and feels soo clean, and skin tightening!! So far so good, no more shining face! Great Product. Seller Ships Very Fast Too. A+ My daughter loves this product!! Something for oily skin, that isn't drying.  :) Great product !"
B005OKYNW2," Works well. Amazing good Love this product, always use it just after shaving which stops any itching. I've been using this product for a few years now and I love it.  My skin gets moderately oily, mostly on my forehead.  Most facial cleansers would make my skin feel dry and tight after use, but not this one.  The scent isn't strong or overbearing, so it won't conflict with after shaves, cologne, etc .  I use this once a day and my skin doesn't get oily unless I'm sweating from a work out or out in the heat.  I use about a small grape size amount when I'm clean shaven, but use a little more when I let my beard grow out.  This stuff creates a decent lather and isn't difficult to wash off.  This is my preference, but I like how it doesn't leave my face feeling extremely slippery while rinsing my face off and I can tell all the soap is rinsed off. Great face wash.Very cool and refreshing and leaves your face feeling smooth and clean. Fresh, pleasant scent, too. Excellent choice for a male face wash! Love this facewash, works well, feels nice. Definitely will be buying again Nivea men made good products for us. Thank you! Smells good and face feels great afterwards Great product, use it daily and your skin will love you. Excellent Sales and Service! been using this for over a year and absolutely love it. I like this Nivea Cleansing face wash. Love the menthol/refreshing rush you get when using this product in the morning.  Will definitely help wake you up and get you pumped for the day. I bought it for my boyfriend, and he thinks it's very comfortable after washing his face Good quality good I like the scent of this product and my face feels clean after using it. The best! I was no much into using face wash until I came across this on a Amazon deal as a filler.By far the best, awesome scent and a sense of freshness that stays for a while.I highly recommended this, I will be surprised if someone doesn't it, unless there is a condition. Feels great after a close shave and all other times/ Perfect for removing ACNE. I know if doesnt say anything on label about acne but I stopped getting acne after using this product I was satisfied with this product Good stuff Good Very clean feeling. Helped with hyper-keratotic areas without drying healthy areas. good I love this face wash. Works for me decently I use it a couple times a week, it helps with dry skin from the winter months.  Leaves a pleasant minty smell.  Will buy again keeps my face moisturized during the day. it helps cause I live in the Caribbean n the heat and humidity makes you  break out from dry or oily skin. Great neutral face wash. It does not dry your face out, nor is it so moisturizing that it feels heavy or greasy. I use it every day and am pleased with it. Used it a few times. Works very well on my extremely dry skin. Very good. Out of expectation. I am a guy that doesn't like to wash his face very often, but when I do, this really seems to get it very clean.  I use this with the scrub about once a week for good lasting results. Very nice. I keep it in my hiking backpack and will be buying a one or two more for the office, other cases I use. This is my favorite everyday use facewash... It's cleans and refreshes the skin without drying it out... The site scent is nice also... Gentle yet effective. I have used this product for a while and have sensitive skin. I complement this (alternating with a scrub wash every other day) and this does the job. Really nice facial cleanser, leaves your face feeling nice and clean without any residual film or oiliness Good product. Husband likes to use it. Exelent product.Love it! My husband loves it. He even uses it to shave his head. Good Great product ,must have for men .I use it every morning and I love the refreshing mint feeling .My face looks clean and shiny all day . Makes your face feel fresh. I use this in the shower. It kind of has a CK1 cologne smell to it, but it's good. I'm not sure it's doing anything for my face, however it does feel fresh after the wash.

This product is good, keeps my face feeling fresh and clean after each wash. It has reduced spots and  pimples. This is my second purchase.

Excellent Love it very much. Smell good. Feel fresh after using it. I will use it daily and recommend it to everyone. I am Satisfactory with this product. I will buy it in the future after the one I am using running out. Does a terrific job . Use twice daily. Won't regret it. Best face wash hands down, I have tried A LOT of others. I give it a five because Nivea is and always was a great product for Men.  I highly recommend it.  Thanks. loved it . I like it. good My face is brand new again. Very nice skin care for men ok I have mild acne at 24, so I'm always on the lookout for regimens that will keep my face reliably clear. Before I bought this, I was using Oxy 10% benzoyl peroxide face wash at night and a salicylic acid face wash in the morning. The combo may have done some good, but I still almost always had a couple of blemishes. In any event, I felt uneasy (with respect to skin care) about staying with that combination.When I bought this, I started using the Nivea in the morning and the Oxy at night. The results have been excellent. My acne has improved dramatically, and the wash smells and feels good to boot!Definitely going to buy this again.(I've only been using this for about a month, so I can't claim these results are going to be lasting.) excellent Perfect! I am very happy with this product. You only need a little dab about the size of a chocolate chip. First wet hands and face. Place a dab in one wet palm and rub hands together to work up a slight micro foam. Rub hands on face and massage on face. Work the oily areas with your finger tips. Rinse face using a wash cloth. One tube has lasted a little over a month. This product does not make big soapy foam, just a slight micro that works. I continued to be happy with the cleaning properties of the product and the way it helps my skin with daily use. I highly recommend it to any man who wants to keep his face/skin in the best shape possible. I will keep purchasing this product! I have been using this product for years, and have been very happy with it. Cleans well, smells great, and my girlfriend loves the smell!Also, I have skin on the drier side, and this helps better than some of the other boutique and mainstream brands that I have tried. Still going to test Aveeno brand, bit so far, this is the best for me.Also, you only need a dime or nickel size amount of product to properly clean your face and have enough left over for whatever else you might need.Totally recommend this one. Clean, smooth face wash. I also like that Amazon packages it inside a second bag (at least the times I've ordered it) so that in case it does break open or something it's contained. So far it hasn't.The packaging is well made too.  I like that it stands with the cap on the bottom and the tapered top makes it easy to squeeze out. The fact that it's got a clear portion in the middle makes it easy to see when I'm running out as well. Great as a pre-shave wash and I also shave with it instead of shaving cream as well. Plumps the hairs for a smooth shave and the bit of menthol is cooling.  A very good all around product that is not as drying as soap on the face.I normally used to use bar soap on my face, but this is a nice simple alternative for those up for trying something different but don't wan't to0 get into fancy/speciality skin care.  Men, men, men, men,men,men,men,men...... Great product.  I use this when I shower every morning.  It just puts the menthol feeling in your face, but it really feels good in the morning and cleanses the face to feel clean.  It's also easy to rinse off and does not damage any skin.  It's great to use before putting on lotion on the face.Great product, will definitely buy once I run out.  It has run out already before, and I've bought it again already.  ;) I like so many things about this product.  It cleans well and  leaves a very refreshing feeling.  It helps keep my face moisturized.  It has a pleasant, mild fragrance.  It's easy to use.  It lasts a long time - A little dab goes a long way and I've been able the same tube for a couple months. I got this for my fiancé along with the sensitive facial moisturizer because he gets very dry skin in the wintertime which causes razor burn after shaving a few days in a row. He says it works very well, especially compared to the body wash he had previously been using to cleanse his face (!!). It also smells very nice--not overpowering or intense, but an attractively noticeable scent. This is my everyday facial wash, the one that I use in the morning and during the day.It has a nice smell and it lathers up nicely. I don't need a whole lot and so each tube of this size lasts me between two and three months.I have combination skin, and this facial wash leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh and soft without over-drying. long time friend of mine. Been using this for almost 2 years with no regrets or desire to change face wash. Its gentle and doesn't seem to clog my pores. Skin has looked better ever since starting to use this and haven't had any flare ups. I use twice a day as recommended and it seems to be the perfect amount, not too harsh on the skin and doesn't make it red. My favorite face wash by far! It lathers just right and rinses away cleanly. I never have dry skin afterward like I do with other soaps. It has a very light scent. It keeps away minor breakouts.This has been the best men's face wash I've encountered.  I've even gotten compliments on my skin! I use Nivea men face products and they really take good care of my face. Last time I had a facial my therapist told me my skin looked great. I'm rating this 5-star because of the price. The product itself was good. It's hard to tell exactly how good it is because i'm not using a different one every night, but it leaves the skin looking better than it does without it. Apply a moisturizer after also I like the smell of the cleanser and the menthol adds a ""refreshing"" feel. The texture feels like a soft gel. As with any cleanser, after cleansing, use a light lotion even if this is a ""moisturizing cleanser"". I was my face 1-2 times a day depending. I ordered this and the similarly priced Neutrogena Men Invigorating Face Wash, 5.1 oz). This Nivea face wash seems to be by far the superior product. It is thicker - less diluted, and doesn't make my face dry like the Neutrogena face wash does. Item was as stated in the ad.Item arrived on time and without any damage. Well, good brand I always trust.I prefer Nivea over Clean Clear now since it doesn't use alchohol to dry out your skin. (i learned it from American Psycho) And it's not just for your face either. You can use it anywhere, any time - regardless of your gender! Seriously though, use it the night before a nice date and they'll be wondering how the hell you can be so soft without being oily. I'm looking at you Jergans. I like this facewash. it makes my skin smooth and smells nice. You have to really use a small portion as it is super concentrated. I put a dime size amount and work it into a rich lather. My girlfriend loves the smell as well. Hubby says 5 stars!  He has been using for years. Our local market does not have it any longer so I checked good old reliable Amazon!  OF COURSE they have it!  And the price is very competitive, too!  BONUS!  The scent is not too strong and very masculine.  The best part is that it does what it is supposed to do - cleanse well!  We have soft water so he doesn't have to use very much to get a good sudsy foam going.  This is excellent!  Highly recommend! Compared to the men's Neutrogena face wash, which I had been using the past few months, this stuff is a blessing. It is extremely mild on your face and doesn't dry it out. Nice fresh scent and cleans well. Cleaner leaves face feeling very clean and refreshed. Have noticed a less oily skin since beginning using this. Acne has never been a big issue, but is even less frequent now it seems with this facial cleaner This is the best product out there for men on cleaning and face care.  I'm an old cowboy and surely have a dried out weather beaten face.  I been using this for two years and it's a crackerjack product!  It gets the grease off my face real good.  Added bonus is the moisturing it does on my weather beaten skin. To top it off it leaves my face all tingly and it smells great to!  You will like the hell out of this product. Good product, good value for money. good GREAT PRODUCT This cream is perfect to wash away the day all the greasy NYC you accumulate on your face after a day at work. The scent is very refreshing and makes it perfect to use in the morning too when you need a boost of energy to wash the sleepiness off your face.The face wash is a light blue and it foams very easily as soon as you apply to the wet skin. You are supposed to wash it off right after and it will leave your skin very clean and moisturized. Most face washes dry your skin too much while this is a good balance between deep cleaning and drying the grease away.The size of the bottle is great to carry in a backpack for your travels (just don't bring it in your carry-on luggage) and to keep in the shower so you can use it every time you are in the bathroom. This face wash is a fine product. I've used several other face washes but the Nivea seems to clean and soften my skin best in preparation for my morning shave. I've experienced none of the adverse reactions some reviewers mention. Smells good. Very gentle and moisturizing. Been using these for the past 4 years or so and it keeps my face looking and feeling clean. I get less pimples using this than any other face cleaner and it does the job and I will use this until I die. Bury me with some if I do die so I my face can still feel refresh and clean in the underworld. great price, wish it wasn't an add-on item though. Cleanses and cools your face. Can really feel the menthol in this which I love, unlike the body wash which I couldn't even tell had menthol (oh axe cool metal, how I miss you...). Doesn't leave your skin irritated or tight either like a lot of washes do. I followed up with the Nivea men's lotion (here: http://amzn.to/2l9skDx) and it's really kept my over oily face feeling fresh. Face wash to cleanse, lotion to moisturize, and my skin doesn't see a need to be overactively producing oil like it usually does. I've found a winner combo!Very happy with this stuff. Have always been a fan of Nivea though. Love this product! It keeps my skin clear and cleans deep. I have more oily skin especially in the summer and It helps with that. Its gentle I even use it ""down under from time to time. Best part is a little goes a long way. The only downside might be that if you have dryer skin you may not be able to use this everyday as I could see it start to irritate. But at the same time It does do a great job at keeping my skin hydrated even in the winter. Overall I think this is a good face wash. There isn't too much I can say about it as I have never had any sort of serious acne problem, but it does help me keep my skin clear. I know it works because if I go on a trip or don't use it for a few days then I'll start to develop pimples. It smells alright although it may not be my favorite scent. I think that this is an overall good face wash and I have already ordered two more to use when I finish the one I'm using now. Grandson is so spoiled using the entire Nivea line.  I have been using Nivea for over 40 years...great product. Bought for my husband. He likes it a lot. Says he it feels tingly and fresh. Prefers this over Dove mens face wash. I have been using this product for a few years now. I apply in the morning, and then again at night. It is refreshing without being overbearing, and leaves your face feeling clean. I have also found that applying this and then rinsing before shaving makes the shaving process smoother. (Just my experience.)One more note: there is no reason to use a lot of gel during each application. Just a little bit applied to a face bathed with warm water goes a long way. Don't rinse it off right away, let it soak in.Excellent product. Face never felt so clean as it does afte r use. My skin looks MUCH better after using this product - AND, unlike other face wash products I've used, it smells great! I have used this for 15 years, no soap on my face. Can't go wrong here , great product and arrived timely ! I've been using it at least once a day. It leaves my face feeling nice and smoothly. I think that if I actually used it more, it would be better but that's just me. Anyone who uses it as the instructions said can comment better on that. Every man should use something like this. Far better then your typical soap. With the aloe this gives your face a really deep clean and tingly feel.  I use this as a combo cleanser and shave cream as I shave in the shower.  Love it! Feel fresh after using it. I use it daily and recommend to everyone. Works great.  Hydrates well.  Use in shower before shaving regimen.  Use at night as well.  Not much odor, scent.  Only takes a little Great stuff! Used the original blue nivea for men face wash for years before switching to this. The scent is great, comparable to baby powder but less pronounced, and leaves my face feeling energized and not dried-out. With the best service. These are what I am looking for. Suit for this price . Arrive on time. The old one has been broke in my family. I wear almost every day from many different places to wear clothes, these products are by far the best and most comfortable. When I say this face wash gets your face clean I mean it! Just let it set on your face for a sec after scrubbing. The menthol is a nice touch too. Great product, easy to easy to wash off This is my favorite everyday use facewash, it's cleans and refreshes without drying the skin. Helps cleanse and cool the face at the same time. A great 1-2 punch against oily skin. ok excellent product 10+ Cheap but great! My face won't feel tight. I love it.. makes my skin clear and soft Doesn't dry my face out too much, feels great as a wash my face. Seems to keep my face clean and without overly drying my face. Leaves the skin smooth and fresh. I purchased this for my brother.  He said it really conditions his skin and it is 100% soap free and dermatologist tested.  He said he would buy it again. I received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest review. It cleans well and leaves a very refreshing feeling on the skin. I highly recommend this. Good stuff, no complaints.  It's does not have that ""sandy"" feel of scrub cleansers, but it does the job well enough without abhorrent smells. Very happy that this one works for my skin type! I rarely experienced acne breakouts anymore because of this one as it thoroughly cleans my face after every use, This is a great face wash for me. It takes out oil and dirt completely for me and I love it Great facial cleanser without causing an over drying effect on my skin. Aside from cleaning your face, this leaves your skin soft and smooth. smooth cleaning very well! This stuff is great. I was finding myself breaking out after spending more time in the gym and needed a better face wash. This stuff smells great and doesn't get crazy foamy which I hate. Beware it does dry your face out quite a bit which is fine but you may need a non oily moisturizer. It has this cool sensation that leaves my face tight and firm whenever I use this facial wash. No acne break outs since December 2015. It cleans well and leaves a very refreshing feeling. Good stuff. Clean crisp smell. Leaves my face feeling clean without drying out my skin. Makes my face feel fresh and clean everytime. It does not have an annoying smell. It leaves my face tight and firm after using it. It smells so nice, feels so invigorating and really clears my face up! I use it in the morning and before going to bed and my face has drastically improved over just 3 months. Trusted product! It completely rid my dark spots and acne scars in just using it twice a day for 3 months! No more blackheads since I started using this face wash. It has this awesome scent too. My go to for face wash, the menthol leaves a fresh feeling on your face.  Helps you wake up and refresh also. I've never really made it a point to pay any special attention to washing my face...usually just wet a washcloth and did it in the shower and after anything which required additional cleansing during the day.After reading the reviews and having had excellent experiences with other Nivea products, I used a coupon and scored one of these. OMG...it is amazing what a difference it makes to my face. Shaves are much closer and faster.Yes it's scented with menthol which is clearly stated but frankly, I like it especially before bedtime. It provides proper moisturizer to smooth my face and prevents the growth of blemishes. It has a fresh scent and is really good at removing oil and dirt buildup. It is good. I like the smell Cleans and moisturises as well as leaves a pleasant smell on a man's face. Will be re-ordering ! Cleans your face.  I have had no problems with breaking out since using this.  Lasts a long time since I only use a small dab each day while showering.  A bottle will last a few months and my face is squeaky clean.  No idea why its labeled for men, since its probably just face wash lol Great I've used this wash for a few years now but only recently started using it nightly.  My face is a bit dry immediately after use but the next morning my skin always looks and feels soft and healthy.  If you're an electric shaver user, shave as soon as you get up without getting your face wet or anything--you'll be surprised how well your shaver works.  This stuff also has a nice scent.  I recommend it! husband loves it First time user here. I like it been using for little under a month and my skin feel great no complaints I do I use Nivea men's cream after the case wash. Feels good refreshing. I actually got attention from Lucy...F off Linus you missed your opportunity! Next is Peppermint Patty, I am part Irish, too! Great, the same as supermarket. Good 5 stars for this amazing face wash! Perfect for my sensitive skin. good product, fast shipping Great!!! Good and fresh!"

My favorite cleanser, no doubt. I like this product cuz it feels, smells and works great on my skin...^^* I love this product. It really cleans my face well. Used it for years I love this creamy cleanser, smells great, moisturizing. I used the Image Ormedic skin cleanser, and I like Vital C even more! It's helped with my uneven skin tone by reducing the red spots, and anything that helps get rid of sun damage means it helps with anti aging as well! I have an oily skin type, and I recommend this product. Creamy & still does a good job cleansing Love it!!! Has a pleasant citrus smell. Very hydrating and leaves your skin feeling clean but not that squeaky clean that pulls on your skin and I love the citrus smell! I love all Image products! Quality ingredients that are gentle! Quick shipment and in original seal! I have been using this company for almost a year now and this product especially has helped me clear up a lot of problem areas. When I thought I needed to dry out my skin, I realized my body needed the complete opposite and the Vitamin C Hydrating Facial Cleanser did just that. It's just what I expected This is the best cleanser!  I love the scent!  Arrived quick and in perfect condition. Use it every day and will definitely reorder My wife absolutely loves this product and it has made noticeable improvements on her complexion. Use it everyday in the shower, I apply it with my facial cleansing brush. Love the scent as well. Image really delivers what it says.I use this along with their other products and find them all to work very well with my skin .This is one of my favorites for the face wash. My all time favorite facewash. I recently tried to be cheap and buy something cheaper and local- I broke out immediately. I first found this product during a salon facial. It doesn't lather and is very creamy. It removes my makeup and keeps my skin from the dry feeling after. I use the moisturizer and vitamin c as well. Very nice cleanser. It hydrates for sure. My skin feels cleans and exfoliated. Great facial cleanser.  Use it everyday. Great product for my sensitive skin! Also coconut free is a huge bonus for me (I have a severe coconut allergy!) Was recommended this product at spa in Blue Ridge, GA. I am pre diabetic suffer from extremely dry skin. Have literally used every face wash out there!! Low to high end. This is by far the best. I am not someone with naturally silky skin, this was is very hydrating and has a fabulous citrus smell that is clean and refreshing and a little goes a long way. Not a foaming wash and made of natural ingredients it's a hydrating wash it don't foam. It was 40.00 at spa and at Amazon same bottle about 15$ less! I couldn't afford it if not for Amazon. 1 bottle lasts me about 1 1/2 month. Been using 7 months now. Highly recommend for DRY/sensitive skin!! It did meet my expectations. I have used this product for several years and will continue to do so. EXCELLENT.  I have been using Image skin care for about 2 years now and I can't say enough good things. The Vital C line is one of my favorites. I had not tried this cleanser before but trusted the quality of the brand so I tried it. I absolutely love it because it cleans well, yet gentle. My skin is very soft and moisturized after I use it. Used as directed, it cleans pours well and leaves soft skin. I love this face wash. It's so gentle and very hydrating. I believe in this stuff!! long time user, love the product love this Image Vital C is very gentle and refreshing. I suffer from rosecea and this product provides cleansing without dryness, helping keep flare ups to a minimum. Highly recommend. This is an amazing product. Vital C easily takes off my makeup and lightly cleanses my skin. You don't have to use very much and its a good daily facial wash with a hint of an orange smell. I received my product quickly and I'm very happy with the authenticity of the product. Better price than the stores!  Great product I have used this product for many years and absolutely love it.  It cleanses my skin along with leaving it nice and smooth.  I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade from what they are using presently. Great product, has really made a difference in the tone and texture of my aging skin. I LOVE the scent and wish that Image had a perfume or cologne with the same scent. Even hair spray with this orange scent would be lovely to have. I have used the Image Vital C Hydrating cleanser for several years and love it. It is gentle, cleans well without drying my skin and has a really nice citrus smell. I am in my 40's, so it is important to me that I use products that actually work with my skin and offer some sort of benefit. Image is a pharmaceutical-grade product and I will continue to use as long as it is available. This cleanser is awesome! It's hydrating and smells delicious. It also helps keep my breakouts under control and fights acne. It came highly recommended by my esthetician who advised me to only use gel cleansers occasionally since they dry out skin. I've seen a significant improvement in the texture and clarity of my face. I love this serum, it plumps my skin and hydrates it at the start of my every day. I use the sunscreen lotion after this and makes a perfect matte for my makeup. This line of products help my skin stay hydrated all day without becoming greasy. Makes my face feel smooth and hydrated. Does not clog my pores. Love this product! i have rosacea this specific product line works best for me - i just use the cleanser and moisturizer. I LOVE this product.  I have very complicated adult onset acne plus on occasion dryness with eczema.  This product is my favorite for the winter months.  My face cleared up within 3 days of using this product.  I LOVE IT!!!!!!!! Good facial cleanser for sensitive skin. I have used this cleanser every day for years. It doesn't dry my skin, and can be used either wet (in the shower) or dry (with a makeup wipe).  It is so gentle, I use it to remove eye makeup.  Great product!  Really appreciate being able to buy it on Amazon, since my local spa charges just about double for it. The vital c cleanser smells great, cleans gently and effectively and is very gentle.  I have sensitivity to most facial products and have no issues with this cleanser.  Highly recommend for all skin types. great product, good smell, leaves your face soft and healthy I been using this cleanser for over a year now. I love it's contansy it does what it suppose to do clean your face. This is one of the best lines.  I'm so glad my dermatologist recommended it. I've used the Image Skincare product line for over 2 years but this is the first time I used the Vital C cleanser. It's amazing! My skin feels moisturized after cleansing and it helps with the redness in my skin. Having been using this for a while. Love this! Nice fragrance I love all the Image products and this one is no exception. Smells great and contains quality ingredients that are skin loving. I love this cleanser and use it every day. I have been using the image vitamin C creme image line for 5 years and love it . If you have dry, sensitive skin like me I can highly recommend it  I have tried so many products over the years and find this with the creme is the staple of my skin looking great. This stuff is amazing! I've never been able to find a face cleanser that worked well for my very dry skin. This is different. The citrus aroma is heavenly and the hydrating lotion feels wonderful as you massage it around your face.  I actually look forward to cleaning my face every night! I love this product! I have been using it for a while, I have purchased it from different providers, they all have been great!! Will order from any one of them again! Since I have been using this product on a regular basis, I have gotten more ""you have lovely skin or a beautiful complexion"" than I can count. It smells fresh with the scent of oranges and is gentle on one's skin. I can softly wipe off the day's make up grime with a cotton ball. Great product Love all the vital c products. My skin is soft and no wrinkles. The cleanser is non greasy and leaves my face moist and elastic. I totally love this cleanser (hard to find) as it helps to keep my rosacea at bay. Feels nice on my skin and does not irritate it. Leaves my face sparkling clean but soft. My face is brighter and more even weeks after using it. I am a huge fan and recommend it to anyone struggling to have pretty skin. The skincare specialist I see for facials recommended this product.  It is amazing.  I have always had very dry skin and thought I was doing what I should for it, but I wasn't.  My skin is 100% better after using this and the moisturizer. I have been using the Image Vital C products (all of them, cleanser, serum, cream, scrub and mask).  AWESOME PRODUCTS.  my face has never looked better.  Very smooth and even and no breakouts.  I used to breakout with anything else.  GREAT PRODUCT LINE and good investment for the price. I have been searching for a good cleanser for my chronically pissed off skin and this is it! Up until now everything that I have tried left me with red angry skin so I'm thankful for both the image vital C cleanser and hydrating cream. I bought these here on Amazon after using samples from my salon facial  for two weeks. its rich but light, very gentle, smells wonderful. I have used this for over a year and really like the gentle quality of it. I use a beaded scrub once a week and this every day. It is gentle and soothing to the skin. Nice scent and very good price on Amazon. I love this product.  It is the best .. So smooth going on and it makes my skin feel so soft and hydrated.. I love it love it ,first got it in Dr,""S  office  at a much higher cost  . It is light ,cleans all your make up plus eye without  burning . I’m an esthetician and I absolutely LOVE this brand! This line is great for sensitive skin and smells great! Nice, mild, effective, and it is the real Image Skincare line. Quite happy this is the best stuff. My eyebrow lady turned me on to this a few years ago and I have never looked back. Excellent transaction I've been using this product for 2 years and I love it.  It hydrates and cleans my over 50 skin.  I'm use to paying a lot more for the product $35-45.00 so when I found it at cost it was a sell.  I have Amazon prime so I had in 2 days. A+ Great for sensitive skin. Smells so good. I'm an esthetician. I can't keep this product on my shelf. I had to buy one on amazon because my order from iMage was shipped late. 2day shipping can't beat that. Love this face wash. While it doesn't take off eye makeup the best, it does leave my skin feeling very smooth and soft! I notice a definete difference in my skin when I use this cleanser! This was recommended to me by my dermatologist because I have rosacea.  It has a very pleasant citrus scent and leaves my face feeling very clean. I love this cleanser. My girlfriend who is married to a plastic surgeon suggested I try it, and I have been using it ever since. It is not cheap, but well worth it. Highly recommend for people with rosacea. Absolutely LOVE this cleanser.  Meant to be used on skin without adding water, just rub into your face and then just washcloth it off.  I have normal/oily skin and I'm over 38 so this stuff rocks.  Always get compliments on my skin! Great cleanser, I prefer this over the green label..this is more moisturizing...but both are good cleansers.,  Use this at night, the green label in the A.M. Love this product the price and the fast service I received...Thank You Amazon...:) I have tried many different facial regiments, as I have combination skin and am prone to breakouts that get very sore. I use this stuff every morning, and don't need any moisturizer. I still get blackheads, so at night I use Neutrogena all-in-one to get the dirt out of my pores. This will definitely remain in my daily routine! This was my favorite of the image but didn't over time make a difference! It was fabulous as far as taking off makup(I only wore tinted moisturizer). Smells great! Not drying! I had to stop using after a year it was not cleaning well my pores were clogging even though I was using Image line (per my estetician). I have been using this product for over 2 years.  The vitamin C encourages the production of collagen and has softened the lines around my mouth. This keeps my face soft and moisturized.  It smells good and helps me look younger.  My skin was dry and this fixed it. I am surprised that this is being sold here though. Image company requires that it only be sold through medical facilities and practitioners.  I am glad though because it was half the cost. It arrived promptly. Very good quality..the same as the one I got from my dr. Cleans well. Love the smell. I love this facial cleanser.. This is the 3rd time buying it and it is worth it! I love the light orange aroma too! Refreshing! I have very sensitive skin.  It gets dry and irritated, and it breaks out.  I have been using this cleanser for many years, and get lots of compliments on my skin.  It is great for sensitive skin and a little bit of the cleanser goes a long way.  It's a bit expensive, but it's worth every penny. Love this product, gentle on the skin and has a citrus fragrance.2nd time purchased. I use this cleanser after being out on the salt water & my face feels like it was sand-blasted.  It's very soothing, creamy & leaves your skin feeling so soft & nice.  Highly recommend this creamer. Love this cleanser. Nice hydration cleanser. Love this product. It is the first cleanser I have ever used consitantly. I like the way my skin feels from using it and I love the hint of orange fragance. I have very sensitive skin and after 6 mos of using this product I haven't had one issue. Good product This is a great facial cleanser.  I have sensitive skin and can't use oil based cleanser/lotions and this doesn't break me out.  Smells good too. Fast shipping, fantastic product line. Great. Love the product and the price! This is the only facial cleanser that doesn't take the moister out of my face. Plus it keeps my skin calm. So glad I can order this on Amazon because no one sells it anymore I love Image Vital C facial cleanser!  I have never been brand loyal before.  I have pretty average combination skin: maybe get a pimple or two once a month, slightly oily in the T zone and slightly dry everywhere else.  I have used everything from expensive department store brands, high end luxury products, to Wal-Mart's finest (as well as their cheapest).  I've never found anything I really got too excited about.  I went to an open house at a local spa and in their gift bag they included a full sized bottle of Image Vital C cleanser.  I tried it that night and immediately fell in love with the light citrus scent.  Even my husband who is very sensitive to smell and generally doesn't like anything scented commented that it smelled really great.  I continued using it for a couple of weeks and loved how soft and smooth my skin was.  My combination skin was less dramatic - the oily zone not quite as oily and the dry zones not quite as dry.  Nice!  I wasn't breaking out - but I don't do that often anyway.  Then, a couple of months later I had an extreme reaction to a prescription and ended up with a large area of my face being overcome with a tissue killing rash and in many places blistering and turning into huge open wounds.  It looked like a handful of acid had wrapped around my face, ear and neck.  It was awful.  As I recovered the Vital C was the perfect thing to keep the area clean and yet not burn or hurt when it touched the broken, healing skin.  It claims to be good for post-surgical skin, and I give it a bit of credit for having minimal scarring.  I am fair skinned and heavily freckled, so the new tissue is very noticeable still (8 months later) - but only because it doesn't have any freckles.  The skin is nice and firm and healthy and not red or puckered or scarred.  I just hope the freckles fill in over time - but I can't count on any product to do that!  I'm now a loyal Vital C user.  I buy it in the spa sized bottle when the deal is right because I know this is the only thing I want to use summer and winter.  I love it! The foam feels fresh and hydration even while it cleanses. I'm a mid-aged lady with sensitive skin. These products hydrate and don't clog pores or cause breakouts. My skin has less of a red undertone which is my natural state. Love this product and deliver was just on time Amazing cleanser! I have very sensitive skin, mixed-dry-oily with breakouts and this cleanser has helped me to hydrate my skin and heal. By Amazon CustomerWonderful facial cleanser! Refreshing and moisturizing.  Love the feel and vitamin c scent Great price.  Speedy delivery.  Always ready to answer any quesitons. First introduced to this at a spa.  Was excited to find it on amazon.  Smells refreshing! I was introduced to this product 5 yrs ago and have not found a product that is better. My face stays hydrated through the harsh winter and it is gentle enough on my sensitive skin. I love this product Really like this product especially how it smells.  It's very cleansing and feels like the true Image product. This line of products are great! They aren't harsh on your skin, and it gently cleanses your face. I love it and recommend it to anyone that is looking for a facial cleanser. Love this product it hydrating for my dry older skin, my only grip is it doesn't remove eye makeup but that's a small issue. Love ordering them from you fast speedy supply thanks. I love this product, it is my second bottle that I have purchased. I use a damp wash cloth and massage into my skin and it takes off my make-up no problem. I love Image products and I'm glad that I can purchase them at a lower price thru Amazon. Love this stuff -gentle but gets it all - smells light too. What is the price of Image skincare vital c I have been using serveral Vital C products for years. Great products. On the high side in price, but works so well that I pay the price I love this stuff.. .. feels like heaven on the skin.. and vit. C is so important.. I could notice a different shortly after.. My favorite skin care brand. Smells so fresh my husband loves it, too. Great skincare product! Been using this for years! Great product,great seller,Great Price. Freckles almost gone! My go-to for facial wash! It does an amazing job plus it smells wonderful! I originally purchased in an office while having a facial. Much cheaper on Amazon for the same great product! This cleanser was recommend for redness & mild rosesea.  My complexion has improved greatly in the years that I have been using.  I would rather not use anything else. Love this product Love this stuff! Reca L. Williams My favorite cleanser.  I won't use anything else. Love it!!! Smells wonderful..........used it the first time when I went to a spa for a facial and loved it enough that I came to Amazon and bought some for home use! I would recommend this product to any skin type.  It leaves skin smooth, not oily.  If I could afford it, I would use is to clean my whole body.  It smells fresh like orange blossoms.  Product arrived in good shape and more quickly than anticipated. I use ""IMAGE"" products because the Professional Skin Therapist I go to recommends these.  She uses these on her clients and also sells these products in her shop.  I've been very happy with the order & shipment experience going thru AMAZON.COM for these purchases. Excellent cleanser leaves your face feeling soft and clean This product by Image is great.  I always thought a harsh cleanser was the way to go but now I know  that a gentle cleanser is the best! I love the Image products! I never let myself run out of this! This is the second time I've purchased this face wash and I love it. It was recommended by a estetician who gave me a facial and I really like it. Smells great and super creamy texture. I originally bought this from my facialist and loved it but of course I'm an Amazon person so reordered it twice. I always have 2 on hand- 1 in the shower and 1 by my sink. Fabulous face wash especially for dry skin but it's good for all!! One of the best things that I have tried.  Skin feels soft and more supple. I love this cleanser!  It feels great, smells wonderful and I appreciate the fact that I don't have to use water with it.  You can message it in then wipe it off with a tissue, leaving you skin clean without feeling stripped. Absolutely love this line! I was given a sample at the spa and fell in love from the start. My skin is glowing! I highly recommend. Love the smell, leaves my skin soft. Love this line! Keeps me pimple free after 30. My skin can be challenging to manage.  It trends towards dry, but I sometimes get clogged pores which result in fine bumps across my nose.  Cleansers with salicylic acid are typically too harsh for my skin and also dry it out.  High emollient cleansers result in uncharacteristic acne for me.  I had been using a basic glycerin cleanser to keep my skin soft and moisturized, and a prescription acne medicine to control the bumps across my nose.  While this routine was adequate, my skin was just looking dull and tired.  I've tried dozens of cleansers, so when I received the cheapish looking bottle of Vital C in the mail, my expectations were low.  Boy was I wrong!!  This cleanser not only leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized, but it has allowed me to discontinue use of my prescription acne medication because all the bumps across my nose have vanished.  After a couple of weeks use, my skin started looking brighter, fresher, smoother, and more even.  I've even stopped wearing make-up to work some days, which is something I've NEVER done before.  Image Vital C is definitely the best cleanser I've ever used.  It is well worth the price. The light orange scent is the best I love this cleanser!  It smells very nice too. It is easy to use and mild for m sensitive skin.  I have been using it about 4 months and have already reordered another bottle. Great product. This is the only cleanser I like to use. No breakouts, no dryness. Love it. Fast shipping. Great face wash and doesn't dry out skin.  Takes very little product. Love Image - can't go wrong on their citrus products. Love this cleanser!  Removes makeup, doesn't dry out my skin. Leaves it moisturized and soft.Seems to reduce redness. Love this product!  My go to morning and night. Thick and creamy. Cleaned well, smelled great. Great Product This is the best cleanser I've used for my clarasonic...love the way it works and has a pleasant scent!  This seller delivered as promised..would buy from them again. I love this stuff. Nice light citrus smell and cleans all makeup off without scrubbing or drying. love My face gets dried out alot when using facial cleansing products. So I thought to give this one a try. It is a cream cleanser so it worked on my face. I massage it around my face for 20 seconds or so and then rinse it. My face feels nice and smooth and soft. Not dried out like some other products do. This cleanser is great, smells good and works to keep my skin hydrated. Love this product This is the best facial cleanser I've ever used.  Love the scent! Best skincare for people with rosacia like coloring on face. So gentle and effective. OK This is an amazing product and smells great for men or women.  And it's not greasy.  I highly recommend it.  Been using it for more than two years now. Good price, fast service. My go to face wash, has my skin looking better than ever! I gave it a 5 star because I love this product.  I use Daily Defense products and can tell a major difference as far as hydration and smoothness.  I recommend the Daily Defense serum and mask and also the moisturizer. Love this cleanser...best I have ever used.  Skin feels soft and very hydrated.  Great for very dry skin like I have Wonderful! Leaves skin feeling soft and has a terrific citrus scent. Love it.  I wish it was more affordable! This skin care line is great. It leaves my skin clean but not over dry. I love how it smells. I am over 60 and this cleanser is perfect for me.  It works well for me in the SW Florida climate.  I had originally purchased 2 yrs ago from a Salon here in Fort Myers.  This time purchased from Amazon at better price.  This is a keeper. My daughter has very dry skin that also breaks out and this has been the only cleanser she can use. Amazing stuff....I really like it, and my face is smoother, softer, more moist...all the time. works great just great! This is a great product for sensitive and/or combination skin. It doesn't seem to strip your skin of its natural oil and yet your face feels clean after using this cleanser. This serum is outstanding.  It is very light and you only need a small amount to leave your skin feeling totally refreshed. WONDERFUL!!!! Great product!!! I have rosacea and it's very soothing!! Packaged well and very prompt!!! It smells really fresh and cleans the skin without stripping it of natural oils. I'll continue using this. It's worth the money! Love this product!!  This product was recommended by my dermatologist. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking to have younger skin. The product has a rich orange scent and gives my face a glow. I have been using the product for three months now and will not ever use anything else. This is a nice, gentle face wash that has a very creamy texture.  It really doesn't lather but cleans well and doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy.  If you have dry skin this is the face cleaner for you. My wife turned me onto this product. It works great and you have a hint of oranges on you as well. Love  this stuff!! I really love this! I usually use image skin care clear cell cleanser, and the vital c hydrating anti-aging serum. I noticed without the serum I get more flushed (I have rosacea). This works awesome when I use it at night in the shower, really helps reduce the redness and bumps even more. Now one of my staple products for my everyday routine for my rosacea.VERY HAPPY! (: Best Product. good cleans your face without drying your skin out . love it use it every day Great product!

I have been using this product for over a year, it does a wonderful job of cleansing the skin without harsh products or chemicals.  I love it and will continue to use it. Great stuff. Very satisfied. Wonderful product! Has a light fragrance that is clean and refreshing. Makes my skin feel very soft and hydrated. Been using for awhile but buying at 2x the price elsewhere.  Wonderful scent and does amazing things to your skin. Does make your skin look less lines Great price!  Nice lemon scent and cleanses well without making my face too dry. Would order again. Absolutely LOVE Image products. I have Rosacea and the Vital C line is perfect year round for me. No irritation nor dryness. A spa I went to used this as a cleanser during a facial and was recommended for my skin type (combination oily with HUGE pores :/ ). I LOVE the smell, it's not overdrying (although I normally put coconut oil on my face afterward anyway) and it really cleans my skin. I don't like to spend a lot of money on makeup or skincare products, but man-worth every penny! I won't use anything else! Highly recommended!

I love it and it gets the skin sooooo clean. Great product. Have used for years. Recommended for rosacea - works very well for mine - you can't even tell I have it! Makes my skin look and feel awesome!! Is helping with fine lines...pumps my skin up! I really love this facial cleanser and will look into other products by this company Love this product, best makeup remover and great price Love this product. i love this face wash. I have acne prone dry sensitive skin..this works amazing.i have not broken out much since using it almost a year now I can't say how amazing this product is without going on forever. I quit smoking 8 months ago and instead of improving, my skin went downhill fast. Being a smoker, I always paid special attention to my skin (I know, I should have paid more attention to the smoking than to my skin), but meh. I am also a RN with dermatology experience and have tried or have knowledge of many different brands and product lines. After using this cleanser for only one month the improvement in my combination skin is phenomenal. The glow is instant and lasting, the lather isn't harsh and smells great - plus I can feel it working. I use it twice daily in the shower, massaging for at least one minute and then letting it sit while washing below the neck. Speaking of neck, I found that I still need to use my harsh benzoyl peroxide acne wash there and around my jawline as I continue to get regular ingrown hairs between shaves and Vital C does not do anything to combat my acne, which is fine because that's not what it's for and the rest of my skin is smoother, taut, and glowing. I couldn't be happier, already reordered, and stopped looking for other cleansers. You will love it! Excellent product. The product easily cleans off make-up. I did not realize how much it hydrated my skin until I stopped using it for a while! Just starting using it. Already love it. Love this product line!! I love this cleanser.  Keeps my face soft and subtle.  Even when I go for facials they comment how clean my face it.  Love this product! Got this originally as a sample from an esthetician.  Just loved how creamy it was and didn't leave my face dried out. This is an amazing product! I swear by it! awesome product, love the entire line of Vital C  product came quickly Same product as my med spa has but costs less The best cleanser I have ever used and it smells so good. I have used this product before and loved it. Amazon didn't carry it when I was using it before It's a great face wash that is gentle on your skin! If you have a oily skin, this face wash won't dry out your skin and will help reduce the oil production. I LOVE this daily wear facial cream and it has sunscreen too!!  Win/win!!! I have sensitive combination skin and this cleanser is always my go to.  Cleans well and not drying.  Smells wonderful too! bought this from my derma salon, and found it here at a better price, just cant live without this product I have use this product for years now, it cleans face and really make it look good.I will only use this from now on If you have dry skin, and want cosmeceutical product, you won't be disappointed.  Smells great, like oranges and doesn't dry out my 48 year old skin! Great item and good pricing. I use this item twice a day and it makes my face feel wonderful. I recommend to anyone. Received January 2nd and this product is wonderful - -the best! Great! Great for your skin snd smells great I love this cleanser! And it came super quick!

This facial cleanser cleans your face without drying it out and the vitamin C does wonders for keeping your skin healthy.  I love Image Skincare!!! Great for all skin types"
B06Y45MMRL," Seriously loved this cleanser. Even though I ended up having to return it, I still give it 5 stars because it’s definitely my own personal issue (I am super sensitive to certain scents). The cleanser is super silky, makes a great foam, doesn’t leave you feeling tight, and has a really nice herbal-y small. If you’re sensitive to smell, I’d still give it a try, though. Everyone has different needs/issues! The packaging is also gorgeous, a really beautiful frosty glass. Love it! I have been using the product for about 10 days now and definitely notice a difference in my skin. It feels smoother, softer and clean.. but not tight. Removed make-up and doesn't cause breakout's. I've been using this face wash along with the Bloom face oil for over a week and it literally has been life changing. I have sensitive dry/oily acne prone in some spots skin that I've always struggled to find a product that treats both aspects of my skin and this wash is one of the only things that seems to have treated both areas along with clearing up some of my acne. I highly recommend these products and I love that they are all natural and don't strip my skin. It has only been about 2 weeks since I started using this line and I love it. I cannot wait to purchase their Awake toner when released. I’ve been using this face wash for a couple weeks now and I’m very happy. I love the fresh scent and it leaves my face feeling squeaky clean without drying it out. When I have changed skin care products in the past I’ve experienced break outs, but not with True and Olive. Definitely 5 stars! I love using this face wash, a little goes a long way! It has a citrus sort of smell. I’ve seen my skin improve a lot and would definitely recommend it. Great facial wash! I love its ingredients. This is what my skin needed! Thanks :) I am very happy with my purchase of the True & Olive face wash! My face tends to go back and forth between very dry and very oily--depending on the weather. I love this face wash because it does not feel harsh on my skin, but still feels like it is doing its job! Love this product. It definitely cleans your face! I can’t wait to try this with the new balancing facial oil you just recently came out with!! Wow this face wash surprised me. Smelled great, took all the dirt and make up off. Left my face feeling fresh and smooth. Highly recommend it. This product makes my face feel so clean. It does dry up a little so be sure to moisturize. Other than that, this is a great gentle daily facial wash. Great cleanser. My new go-to. Lasts a long time and foams up nicely, bottle design is cute too. I’ve been struggling with acne my entire teenage and adult life! Always go with harsh cleansers, peels, masks....etc, and still have acne, especially around my mouth and chin area. (Intense can hardly be covered by makeup, kind of acne...so you get the idea) anyways, I’m about ready to pay all of my money to a plastic surgeon to give me a new face, when I came across true and olive’s products. I’m a little skeptical when it comes to products like these usually, but I was feeling desperate and impulsive and decided to say “why the f now”.Two weeks later and my skin is the best it has ever been! Not exaggerating in the slightest! The cleanser gently removes makeup and dirt leaving my skin fresh but not stripped! I added a rose water toner (worth it) and then have been using true and olive’s facial oil. It’s as if all my skin needed was moisture and whatever amazing oils/herbs/other natural stuff is in their products. I’m tired of being insecure about my skin, and these products (the cleanser and oil) have made all the difference. Sure the price point is not the same as Olay or CleanNClear but you get what you pay for! It feels good to go makeup free and still feel beautiful and confident. Am no longer a skeptic :) love these products! 10 out of 5 stars.(In the picture, id usually have a ton of acne in my chin area....not any more! There is NOT a filter on this photo) I have been using this for a few weeks now and wanted to update my review. As I have gotten older, my skin has gotten more complicated and I started having issues with rosacea about 6-8 months ago. I was having to use a steroid cream to keep it under control. With using this and a good, organic cream my face has cleared up and I was able to completely stop using the steroid cream. And it smells divine! My skin feels clean without getting dried out. But I still feel like all of the oil and guk is gone, which was not the case with some other ones I had tried. I am going to be ordering more so that I have have one on my sink and one in the shower for easier use morning and night. And it is really concentrated so just a pump is all you need. So it lasts well too. This is the best facial cleanser I've ever used. It goes on your face very smoothly and makes the face feel silky soft and all done when you're done cleaning your face.My favorite things about this cleanser:1. It's made with all organic ingredients.2. It's in a glass bottle so I don't have to worry about the contamination from plastics.3. The facial cleanser is high quality and you can tell from the instant you put it on your face that it's working.4. It's gentle but effective.5. Doesn't dry out my skin.6. Love the brand name I'm a packaging junkie and this packing is 5 star!All in all I like it so much that I would buy this as a gift for a friend and totally refer it to friends and family. This Hello brand is one I'll be looking out for. My skin is up and down. Some days is dry and some days it looks oily. I can never find a product that suits this back and forth with my face. BUT with this face wash, I finally feel like I have a product that suits my skin. I never feel like my face is too dry after I wash it and it feels so clean. This wash also smells amazing! After I wash, I follow up with some moisturizer and I'm set for my day/night. Highly recommend! I love this product! I was pleasantly surprised by the hint of citrus scent that smells good enough to eat.  The cleanser goes on silky smooth and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean with zero tightness.  This cleanser is also a great value.  One small pump goes a long way which is great for my budget. This wonderful organic cleanser is a winner on all fronts! I am very happy with this face wash, as long as I follow up with a moistuizer I am good to go. I have seen quite a difference in my skin already, my blemishes and redness have decreased dramatically which is awesome! Smells yummy.Skin feels refreshed and clean without drying out my skin.I feel really safe using it because it has such great ingredients. I love this face wash! The packaging is beautiful! The wash smells wonderful, a beautiful natural scent with hints of citrus and lots of other good things :) I noticed with two pumps that it produces a nice rich, lather. It took off my makeup well, left my face feeling fresh, and clean. I love how it is organic. This is definitely my face wash from now on! Excited for the other products!! This stuff works really well!! I've been using it every morning for the past few days, and it's already made a huge difference in my skin. My face is much clearer, and I feel fresh!!! Love it. It's a good face wash! I'm not a fan of the smell, but I like how it suds on my skin. I have sensitive skin and it works pretty well! No breakouts so far. Wonderful on the skin. Less dryness afterwards. I always love to try new products and was excited to get this in the mail! I love that it comes in a nice glass bottle and the smell is very refreshing and clean smelling. The face wash makes a nice lather and didn’t dry out my skin like others I’ve tried. I am very happy with this product. I really like that this face wash is totally natural and organic. It smells great and it makes my skin feel nice and clean! Okay I am totally in love with this product! It feels so good washing my face it’s become a pleasure instead of a necessity. Also after washing my face feels smooth and happy. Defiantly buying again! I really love how soft this makes my face feel. Can't wait to try bloom!"
B002MZ4V7O," Feels nice and creamy This i the ONLY face wash that works for me. It's a lifesaver. Been using this face wash for YEARS and it is the best!  My face is always clean and smooth.  Very rarely ever have a zit show up, which is amazing. I like this product because it leaves my skin fresh and smooth. I use it every other day only because I have another Neutrogena cleanser I like as well. At 24 years old I have never written a review on anything ever. No restaurants, no products, no companies. NOTHING. Do you know why? Because I have better things to do. I am a very busy person and I do not waste my time writing reviews for things because I spent $6.00 and it didn't work. I am going out of my way to write this review because this product works. I've had acne since I was like 12 and I've tried everything under the sea to no avail. The first time I used this I liked the way it felt but didn't think much of it- until I ran out. BECAUSE MY FACE BROKE OUT IN ZIT CITY. I became frantic, wondering why this had happened to me. What could I have possibly done or eaten to stress myself out that my skin retreated to it's 14-year-old self? It dawned on me that I had NO acne for a month while using this product. I got in my car at 9:30 PM, drove to Walgreens, purchased two tubes of this and a pack of gum and returned home and washed my face. Within two days the mounds that had appeared on my skin disappeared and no other newcomers came to town either. I will not stop using this product. I will buy out the company. This is not a joke, I was not paid for this. Shut up and buy this now. Love this stuff. I've used it for years now. I'm older, and was distressed to find that getting wrinkles did not mean the end of zits as I assumed when I was younger. This prevents breakouts, but doesn't dry my skin out. My teenage son uses it too, and it prevents breakouts for him as well. I have over the years bought more expensive products, or more natural products, but always switch back because nothing has worked as well. My son is in the Army now and has had me mail him this when he could not find it at the base he was at. It just works. Love this. I have very sensitive skin and this product doesn't dry out or irritate my skin. It took me years to find the cleanser that worked best for me and I will be a loyal user of this one for a while. One tube lasts a pretty long time, but I like buying multiple because I travel frequently (then I don't have to unpack). Great product. I found this face wash about a month before my recent wedding. I woke up on the day of my wedding with NO ACNE. Of any kind. No stereotypical zit for me. My skin looked so nice I didn't wear a stitch of make up at my wedding.If this doesn't convince you of its stress acne-fighting powers, nothing will.I don't like how every other face scrub I've tried leaves my skin with that squeaky clean, but tight and dry, feeling. When I use this scrub my skin feels clean after, but not dried out. I don't feel like I need to slather on the moisturizer right after! I have used this product every day for years with great success. Works well and smells nice. Feel fresh and clean afterwards. Highly recommended! The best cleanser that has ever worked for my face especially with my cystic acne. I was even contemplating going on Accutane before I came upon this cleanser. The only recommendation I have is that you use a face scrubber sponge with this cleanser as it will exfoliate your face of the dead skin. Trust me it'll make your skin so incredibly smooth and pimple free. This is the first review I've ever written on a product I've purchased from Amazon.  Often, if a product is no good, I just won't purchase it again and move on with my life.  If a product is satisfactory or good, I'll (selfishly and lazily) keep it to myself.I'm coming down to the end of my fourth bottle since May of 2011.  I LOVE THIS STUFF!  It is is the _greatest_ face wash I've ever used.  So of course I was compelled to write a review.I started getting acne about 10 years ago when I hit my 20s - and it got progressively worse until I was about 24, until it kind of mellowed out - due largely to prescription Accutane. However, I would always consistently have a few bad acne spots on my face - real tough, painful SOBs - but nothing where it could be classified as me having ""bad acne"" - just bad skin, which I decided to just live with.Anyhow, since I started dealing with acne I've tried Accutane (settled it down, but didn't solve the problem), benzoyl peroxide, differin gel, Vitamin-A acid, pro-activ (the most useless product I tried - total bait-n-switch - but that's what late-night infomercials are for), clindamycin gel (quite good, actually - but only available with a Rx which becomes a pain to constantly have to get), cetaphil, and other stuff, including something from a tall, green bottle that literally looks like a milky, male-produced bodily fluid ('nuff said)  - and this, the Neutrogena Acne Stress Control *scrub* (the power foam wash is useless for me) works THE best.What's great about the scrub is that the beads ""scrub"" away the dead skin cells, while the active ingredient cleans your skin, and the moisturizing agent ensures that your skin doesn't dry out afterwards.My mother-in-law uses this product, and when I was visiting my in-laws in Michigan, I got a hold of it because I had run out of Cetaphil that morning.  I used it without any presumption that it would work or be beneficial - because every Salicylic Acid product has actually worsened and burned my skin (but hey, I needed a face wash that morning).My acne will usually develop over the course of a day, largely based on the amount of stress I'm placed under (I'm a trial attorney, and some days I'm a zit machine), and this product worked like a charm - in spite of the in-laws and all.  No new acne on the first day, and on subsequent days, the existing acne was counter-acted and reduced quicker than even the Clindamycin gel could ever do (which again, is quite good - but does take much, much, much longer for results - which come inevitably).If you're in the market for a new face wash/scrub, definitely give this a shot.  It's literally taken me 10 years to find this product - but it's worth every penny. This product is amazing.  I have used Neutrogena products for years to help keep my acne under control, and this product takes it to the next level.  The exfoliation from the little beads is thorough, and the cool tingle immediately after applying is soothing.  I use it every night to wash away the accumulation of dirt and oil from the day.  Since I have been using this product, the amount and severity of acne on my face have dropped dramatically.  Although it is fairly gentle and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin, it is probably a little too abrasive to use more than once a day so I would be careful about overdoing it. I've been using this for a year or two now.  When I remember to use it twice a day (once in the morning, once at night), the number of breakouts on my face is severely reduced.  When I don't remember, I can tell quite a difference.  One bottle costs $8+tax at my local Fry's.  I figured that since I'll use them eventually, I might as well buy 3 from Amazon for about the same price as 2 from Fry's (I got them on Amazon for $18).  I keep one in the shower and one on my bathroom counter.  Highly recommend. I've been using both the Stress Control Power-Cream Wash and Power-Clear Scrub, and both are outstanding products. It leaves my face very smooth, clear and feeling invigorated. Surprisingly not drying, my face usually feels dewy after washing with this and is gentle enough for use one or more times a day.For those of you who are wondering: The scrub is the same as the wash in every way, with polyethylene beads added to the scrub for exfoliating. The beads do their job well without being overly gritty. Use it every day and it works great Really help a lot to reduce the appearance of acne from stress. It has worked for me. Love this product.  Works great for acne prone skin without over drying. Deff been helping to clear my acne. i still have some but its clearing slowly since i started using this product excellent I am 24, and occasionally would get pimples, that would last for 2+ weeks. I was tired of this and had tried basically everything including Proactiv, other Neutrogena products, and prescription products. I now only use this once/twice a day and have ZERO pimples. MY face also is consistently less oily during the day and my skin does not dry out like it would have with prescription products. I love it and will use it until the end. Good product my wife loves it. I love this product! I had been using clearasil but was still breaking out on a regular basis. I switched to this and it has completely cleared up my skin! I love everything about this product and would definitely recommend it. I'm a 15 year old girl with oily skin but it dries out very easily, and I have some pimples and breakouts but not acne. I got this product hoping it would help control some of that, and it was amazing! I noticed results within the first few days. When I rinsed it off, my skin didn't feel tight but it wasn't greasy, and I even put toner on after that and it still didn't dry out. I haven't had any new pimples since and the ones I have are almost gone. My skin is slightly less oily, but not by much, but I'm okay as long as my skin stays clear! This product was a life saver, and is great for people without acne who need a little breakout control. My skin has bounced from oily to sort dry and sorta oily to combination and back again. I tried every type of product out there from OTC to expensive to prescription to altering my diet, but all to no avail. As a teen, I thought I was stuck with it forever. This didn't change from my teens to early twenties. I usually used makeup to hide the acne and scars that but it was always too heavy and had too many chemicals in it, which didn't let my skin breath. For a while, I was using Proactiv, which sort of worked but sporadically. By my mid-twenties, its effects were no longer effective and in fact, made my adult acne worse!I realized that part of my problem, since the beginning of my acne woes, was that I was trying new acne treatments every month, not giving a product enough time to do its magic when I wanted instant results, which will NEVER happen with any product, no matter what they advertise or the strength. Back then, the selection was very limited and they were usually either too strong, or not strong enough. What I did was that I ended up messing up my skin by choosing harsh formulas that stripped my skin, which only produced more oil, which attracted grime and bacteria, clogging up pores, and encouraged acne. I also knew that my skin probably got accustomed to one treatment and lost its effect, for whatever reason because it'd work for a while, then all of a sudden, I'd be breaking out. The only good thing out of the Proactiv industry was that it prompted other companies to follow a similar formula of a three-step system.Neutrogena was one of them. When I quit Proactiv five years ago and started experimenting with the newer products, I'd give it a good 6-8 months then try something else, all OTC. By that time, my skin's oil levels had reduced a bit and my acne came and went, regardless of any product I used. A couple of years ago, I came across Neutrogena's Acne Stress Control line and at six bucks at Target or any store, it's so friendly to the wallet. Keep in mind, many of these acne products ARE gimmicks but a few are gems, and Neutrogena has is now my must have and for several years. At first, the gentle microbead formula felt too scratchy against my skin but I kept using it and after the first week, I remember seeing how it cleared up  my skin. I was truly surprised but didn't get my hopes up too much. The first week or so, it's sometimes that bliss week and then it all goes downhill. But I kept using it and it was, gasp!, working. Every week, I saw fewer and fewer zits and if they did appear, they weren't big, just a tiny dot or two that went away a few days later and easily hidden with makeup. I was only using the scrub, but I found that the acne STAYS away when I use Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Stress Control Triple Action Toner, 8 Ounce after I wash my face. Every couple of days, after the toner, I use the Neutrogena All-in-1 Acne Control Treatment, 1 Ounce, which makes it very similar to the Proactiv system, but this combo is truly more effective. The entire 3 system costs less than 20 bucks and lasts for quite a while. After two years, I won't use anything else.The color is that pale moss green you see through the container, with little microbeads that massages your skin. There's hardly any smell. It's really gentle (but powerful!) and doesn't over dry and my skin has felt smoother and softer since I've been using it. I use it every morning and every night. I wet my face with LUKEWARM water (not hot as that can actually irritate the skin by breaking capillaries, small blood vessels just under the skin), use a dime-sized amount and make circular motion and spread it all over, rubbing it into my skin for a good minute. One bottle lasts me about 2-3 months and I keep them in stock in my bathroom closet. No way am I running out!The best advice I can give for oily-faced women is not touching your face constantly, sleeping on your back so the dirt/oils on the pillow don't get on your skin, not picking at that zit that might pop up and since I also have oily hair, keeping it off my face as much as possible. Choose a scrub, any kind you want, that will EXFOLIATE your skin and get rid of dead cells lying on top of the skin. Moisturize-MOISTURIZE-moisturize! Most importantly, everything must be OIL-FREE or made for OILY SKIN, that included your face scrub to your moisturizer to makeup--Everything. Now a days, there cost effective products that work and for all skin types and you can even find Salicylic Acid (the main chemical that fights acne and helps to reduce dark spots) in makeup, which I use, that is gentle and not aggressive. In the end, let the product work and be patient, but persistent! great product I have cystic acne.  This product has helped me so much in taming the breakouts.  Not only has it helped with the breakouts, it also leaves my skin looking beautiful.  The redness on my old scars seems to decreease when using this. I use this along with ivory soap and the 2 together are better then anything any dermatologists have prescribed. My husband had a pimple problem. This face wash worked as a miracle! It is a little drying, but it does the job. It prevents pimples and fades acne marks! Definitely recommend! I've been using the Acne Stress Power-Cream Wash (not the scrub) for about 3 weeks now and my skin is the clearest and softest it has been in a long time. I'm 28 years old and suffer from adult acne. It's not that bad but I almost always have bumps all over my forehead and a few large, red ones on my chin, jaw-line area.  I've tried countless washes but this is the only one that works for me. Within about 5 days the bumps on my forehead were almost completely gone. And the rest of my face had cleared up completely. I don't know what makes this wash different than the rest but it is the ONLY one that has made my skin soft and gorgeous. I LOVE IT!!!! I use it with the Neutrogena Pore refining toner (which I must admit I didn't use a toner before), and the Neutrogena spf 15 moisturizer. I am SO happy with the results that I am no longer afraid to go out without make-up on. I'll be buying this product forever I use a combination of Neutrogena Acne treatments together with this product, and I finally cured my skin! I tried a lot of different brands before including very expensive lines, but only Neurtogena series helped me! I have no any skin problems any more! This product works! I've been using this wash for a couple of years now, starting after reading other great reviews. The beads are smoother than the apricot scrubs, which was like using a brillo pad for me, but still effective. Just recently I also added the olay pro x (cheaper sub for the clarisonic) and kept this wash instead of the olay scrub... My skin has never been clearer or smoother! I just got this product yesterday. I've had some stubborn acne on my face for the last few weeks. I used this once last night before bed and when i woke up my acne was close to gone! I was worried that the product would have an off smell to it but it doesn't really smell like anything to me. I'm so happy i finally found a product that works! LOVE this stuff! A great scrub, it did help, I haven;t used tons of products, but I would definitely buy again for over the counter scrub. By far the best acne wash by neutrogena and I think I have tries them all.  Reay keeps my breakouts under control. This really works! I will never use another face wash as long as I live. It clears up and keeps acne off! This works really well for cleansing your skin. It has little micro beads in it that exfoliate really nicely. Neutrogena is forever my favorite skin care brand. Great scrub to get rid of some acne or to prevent them. works great. smells nice. works well if able to maintain on skin and not let anything affect your facial skin like smoking etc.. This makes my skin flawless. I use with the line's toner and it's a great combo. i love it . it works great and doesnt irritate my skin . I recomend this to anyone with face, thigh, back , shoulder , arm and chest acne .youll love it :D♥ Honestly best scrub I've ever used I've had acne for years and this actually cleared my skin really happy with this. We use this product all the time and it has showed some nice results. It works for me and it can work for everyone. Great price, great product, and long lasting! This lasted me over 5 months and helped prevent stress acne. I would recommend the whole line of 'Acne Stress Control' products by Neutrogena. Since then i've bought various other creams from this line. It has helped to control my oily skin to develope zits whenever I'm stressed. Bought for my son. He said he likes it. Not too drying. My daughter loves it and always request to order again when she is getting low. Love this stuff.  Works well for me. AMAZING DEAL!! I saved so much money! Works great with an electric spin facial brush thingie. I felt all tingly and clean. And so refreshed smooth. Love it! Makes my face feel smooth!!! Been using this for years. I've tried others and its just not as good. I have had adult acne since I was about 23.  I have used everything, even the expensive stuff (Proactive, Murad, etc.)  I use this because it works (on me) as well as proactive.  I like the tingle that I feel on my face as well. Cheaper than retail stores! Amazing buy I've been using it a week and I totally can see the results since the first day. My skin feels smooth and acne has been reduced a lot! Actually, I don't have any pimples anymore! I just rub it on my face and let it set 5 minutes and the rinse with warm water, that's it! I've used this face wash for years and it's the best! The acne power scrub and wash are my quick answers to pop up acne and it leaves my face fresh. The price here is better than anything Iv seen in stores I like it because it doesn't over-dry my skin, and smells good compared to other cleaners from Neutrogena.  Since I use it on my face, it does'n leave a bad taste in my mouth ....  Best stuff before bed. I've been battling hormonal acne since my pregnancy and the birth of son two years ago.  I've tried everything from Proactiv to natural/organic products.  This line from Neutrogena seems to do the trick.  I use the scrub in the morning and the oil-free acne wash at night.  Coupled with the toner and all in one treatment, I've had minimal breakouts. Love this, gives you a refreshing feel, keeps your skin soft and cleared my acne! Best face wash I've ever used! Reasonablely priced! It works perfectly well on my skin. Having said that, my skin is not prone to acne, but I do get those occasional ones when i'm stressed. So, this product helps control those break outs for sure. You can feel the burn on your face which is good I use this to wash my face each morning.  It doesn't dry my face out and leaves it feeling clean. Worked perfectly for me. My fav soap so far Really like this facewash. Works great and is relatively inexpensive. I used prescriptions and what not in the past but found that this worked the best. Fantastic! Has helped my stress related break outs! I use this stuff before i shave and it brings the hairs up, allowing you to get a nice smooth shave without any irritation. must have for anyone with ingrown hair issues. This scrub leaves my face very smooth and smells really good! Love this product even better with the matching toner. When I runout of this I start getting pimples. Gentle and soothing Works fairly well, mostly odorless. There are micro beads if you're wondering. Doesn't seem to dry out the skin while doing a great job of cleaning. You also get it here for about $1 cheaper then you will ring it locally. One of my favorite face scrubs. Both my husband and I only use Neutrogena facial scrubs. Great I've been using this product for years!!  Glad to know I can skip the lines at stores and have it shipped for free.  If you have mild acne I'd also recommend using the toner. I am 34 with troublesome constant adult acne. Up until this, exposed skin care products have done the most to help. Using this scrub gave me noticeable results in a week. It has been wonderful and is finally giving me results I've wanted! Not completely clear skin, but manageable for the first time in years! The micro beads feel a little rough, but don't seem to damage my skin. I use it once every other day along with exposed skin care's moisturizer, clear pore serum, and acne treatment. I am using this since 6 years. I purchased this product for my girlfriend. When she applied the Neutrogena gel on a pimple she noticed a great improvement by the next day. It works well on small or big pimples. amazing ! I was totally happy with both purchases."
B00UOLD4DK," Good Love the smell, lathers nicely and works well on sensitive skin. Leaves face very soft. Great daily cleanser. Works better than many higher-priced alternatives. As described and expected.  Better price than shopping at Target. This is the only product that I have been using to wash my face I have oily skin, prone to breakouts. It was recommended by my Dermatologist. I had always used products with salicylic acid, but they always made my skin very itchy, flaky, and dry. Really I just needed to balance the ph of my skin and use along other products prescribed by my Dr.  So I stopped using ""Biore"" it just made my skin worst, never allowed for healing to take effect, simply made my pimples red and irritation visible.  I like the ""Foaming Cleanser"" because it washes off the impurities, antibacterial, but does not over dry. They also have the creamy formula that I tried, but it was way oily for my skin and made it worst. I think the creamy formula would work best for somebody with dry skin and no acne problems. My dermatologist recommended this face wash to me, after trying many other face washes for my acne prone skin. It is super gentle and cleansing at the same time. I've noticed significantly healthier, breakout free skin since I've started using this 6 months ago. It's an excellent face wash! I am always on the look out for a daily cleanser that is great for sensitive skin. All too often, the lotions are filled with too much fragrance and it leaves my skin irritated and itchy. Thankfully, I can continue to use this cleanser every day without an issue. This product works perfectly. My skin was breaking out so much and I could never find a face wash that was gentle on my skin. This is the answer. I have been using it now ever since and swear by it. Works well, makes your face feel really clean after using.  Neutrogena products are usually quality, too. Love this stuff use it daily. A great face wash for all-purpose cleansing. Not drying (though I do have oily skin), doesn't irritate. Great product for cheap Very pleased with this gentle face wash! Use it daily. As expected leaves your face so clean and smooth My favorite face wash. Gentle enough to not irritate my sensitive skin but strong enough to take off makeup. Washes makeup off easily without drying out sensitive skin. I've bought this cleanser 4 times now. It's so gentle and does not dry my skin out, but I am left with a good clean feeling after each use. If you have oily skin this is a miracle face wash! I use it everyday and will never change products. Best cleanser I've ever used. Gentle and doesn't leave my skin dry, but definitely clean! My favorite face wash.  A little drying, but not excessively.  I use moisturizer after washing anyway.  This has no scent and suds up nicely and just leaves a great clean feel. This product is ABSOLUTELY perfect... so gentle but really cleans everything off! I have very sensitive skin on my face and this is the perfect gentle cleanser,absolutely no break out issues. love, love, love this stuff... was actually recommended to me by my dermatologist This product is amazing!! Not harsh This face wash is the best it cleans so good  this I love it! Great daily face soap, bubbles are super soft. Okay, I am a 67 year old woman who doesn't wear make-up and generally just wash my face.  But this cleanser surprised me, it really is different.  I noticed my skin felt better after just a couple uses.  Didn't get rid of my wrinkles but just left it feeling softer and cleaner.  I recently heard a podcast about skin PH and the effects of alkaline soap and that is why I decided to try something new. I have used this for my face, but i did find another brand that helps manage my very difficult skin better. I like having it on hand though because i can still use it on my face, But mainly i got on here to say how amazing this stuff is for washing out beauty tools. I use it to clean my Beauty blenders, Clearsonic brush, Even my Eco tools brushes! Nothing has worked for cleaning out my tools better and the icing on the cake is that if there is any soaps residue left over by chance i know it won't break me out. This stuff is super gentle on everything and it's great at removing makeup. I have had couple of other products just destroy my tools. This is a Holy Grail product in my book! So Glad i found it! I have sensitive skin and use this daily. It is really what it says: ""ultra gentle"". It rinses off easily and has never irritated my eyes.Because I live in the desert, I moisturize after using it. My derm (who has flawless skin) suggested this cleanser to me for my super sensitive skin. It's so light but does the job wonderfully! Clears away dirt and makeup and leaves my skin very soft. I really like it! (Used for two months straight before reviewing) I purchased this cleanser after my dermatologist recommended it as being one of the most gentle, effective cleansers. It has a very nice, subtle ""soapy"" scent. I use it with my Clarasonic and it lathers well and works beautifully. My skin feels super clean and not too dry after using. You can definitely save money purchasing this through Amazon since it's at least $3 more expensive everywhere else! I have been using this face wash for about a year now and finally found the one that works! I've had acne most of my life and many face washes would dry my skin out or burn it and cost an arm and a leg to do so. The Ultra Gentle cleanser is just that - ultra gentle. I use it once daily at night and it always leaves my skin feeling soft, clean and moisturized. I don't claim that it helps acne but, in my case, it hasn't made it worse like other cleansers have. One pump allows me to clean my face, neck and chest without feeling like I'm skimping somewhere. One bottle of cleanser lasts a while. Have been using this for a couple years after I received a free sample. I have relatively clear, smooth skin with the occasional rough breakout (and I'm 30 by the way). After I started using this the occasional rough breakout turned into maybe one or two small zits per year. I have never looked back. Love it! I used to use Purpose, which is very similar, but this seems to work a little better for me. Wonderful quality and great for sensitive skin I used everything but was unable to impress my acne prone skin.Then I gave upon everything and went on raw vegan plan while using this cleanser.Doesnt irritate skin.so far liked it.pimples gone. Cleans without drying out my skin I purchased this as a more affordable alternative to my favorite high end one-step cleanser. Although I still really like my high-end cleanser, this one is a close second. It has a mild but pleasant fragrance and despite this it does not irritate the eyes. In fact, the formula is gentle enough to remove all makeup including the heaviest of eye makeup: mascara, smokey eyeshadow, liquid liner, etc. My only criticism is that it it does leave my skin feeling a little more stripped of its natural oils than my high-end cleanser. As someone with combination skin, this isn't necessarily a bad thing but someone with dry skin may not like that extra squeaky clean feel and may need to follow up with a hydrating moisturizer or facial oil.- Mrs. Simon (Antonio Simon's wife) Best cleanser ever, leaves skin so and not dried out Neutrogena products have always been some of my favorites, but with aging skin, the original formula seemed a bit drying.  This ultra gentle formula cleans well without drying. Good stuff! Gets your makeup off well. Best facial cleanser that I have used. It doesn't dry out the skin and has the right consistency and amount of foaming for a cleanser. Nice size bottle and pump is much handier than a squeeze bottle."
B01MSZB9FH," Can't live without it. Been using it every morning and I feel that it a great moisturizer and drys fast to apply makeup I love Oil of Olay Products & this is exactly what I needed! Great product and for a 66 year old lady my fine lines look more tame I have used this for a long time.  Very satisfied. it just what i ordered have no bad effect from it Exactly what I wanted and arrived very quickly FAST shipping and great product!! As a man, i was a bit worried about the 'girly' smell being too strong.  It smells a bit 'girly' at first but fades quickly.  I love this product- no more dry skin whatsoever :). Awesome! A solid daytime moisturizer with a light formula perfect for everyday use! I absolutely love this! It works perfect for my sensitive skin and it goes on very smooth. I use this every day now and I'll definitely buy more when I run out, although you don't need very much to do the job so it will last a long time! It's a great all-year-round moisturizer for everyone. Highly recommended. I have been using this product for many years. Love Olay products! This is the first time I’ve used this line from Oil of Olay and wow I can already see how clear, smooth and even toned my skin is in just two days. You have to use it twice a day though so don’t forget. Excellent product and fast shipping! Love it! I started using olay products because of my mom... I always see the products in her vanity cabinet and her skin always looks so flawless so I decided to try olay effects 7-in-1 and glad I did!!! I absolutely love this stuff! Lol! Seriously though.. it makes my skin feel so brand new!! I can say that this particular one will be a part of my everyday routine. Hope u all like it as much as I do :-) Go Olay!!! :-) very nice Love Olay I love this stuff.  I have been using it for years.  But last week I found out how great it really is.While I was shopping at Walmart I reached up to get a plastic bag for burger.  When the whole thing fell into my eye.  It swelled up and I felt like I had a concussion.  I think without this product and the eye cream I wouldn't have been able to open my eye.  As it went with olay I barely had a bruise it helped with the swelling witch in turn helped the pain. Keeps my face hydrated. works good love it My skin feels incredible. Glad I accidentally ordered 2. great Have used Olay for many years. Not greasy,doesn't cause acne, I also buy the one that has a touch of foundation in it when my skin is so pale in the winter months. This was a great deal and I got to use a new product that I really like. And I have seen a change in my skin. Best product Olay has for the money.  I used to use expensive products... no more.  This works the same as the store bought super expensive products. great buy I am crazy about the smell of this Olay Total Effects 7-in-1. It is a wonderful soothing and unique smell. That alone has made me very happy. But for some reason, I was sure that a daily moisturizer would have SOME SPF. This one has none. I had another bottle of what I thought is exactly this brand and it has SPF and in fact, that's why I ordered this, because I am out of the other one. Anyway, now I use it as a moisturizer only if I'm home most of the day and away from sunlight or before bed. I do not use this when I go out even though it would do nicely under makeup simply because it doesn't have SPF, ladies, and you want that sunscreen protection.Now the moisturizer itself is rich, creamy, feels absolutely wonderful on face and neck, and did I mention, it smells wonderful?I've been using Olay products after my esthetician friend told me that it is still one of the best and most researched brands on the market, and ironically, one of the most affordable ones. I have normal skin, but a very sensitive skin too and it works fine on my face. I've enjoyed it so much over the years and this one is among one of my favorites now. (Even without the SPF)!. Good luck and hope this helped. Take good care of your skin! this stuff is incredible. i love the texture. it is so smooth-feeling when you're applying it, but it doesn't feel too thick and BOY does it moisturize. it never looks or feels greasy. my skin looks so fresh and bright as soon as i apply this. i have tried and used SO MANY different brands or moisturizers and this is one of my all-time favorites. i wish i could buy it in a large vat. As soon as I put this on, my skin looked better.  Its pretty freaky.  I bought it but I did not expect it to work that well.  The thing with facial products like these, is that they work as long as you are using them.  They puff up the skin, ""so to speak"" so that the lines are harder to see.  That is the way beauty products are.  I am perfectly fine with it.  I started skin care very young and I am aging as good as I can be.  I get complements on my skin and I tell they exactly what I use.  I also believe in very good soluble vitamins, wearing sunglasses and eating plenty of greens.  Washing your face and exfoliating gently and gradually every other night at the age of 47 makes a difference.  Do all that and you will look like you spend a lot of money on your skin care, but you don't. Excellent! I was dismayed when I saw the container. I've had bad experience with squeezable containers, but this one is wonderful. No effort. Moderate amount of cream expelled, neat and tidy container. I love all Olay products. bien Absolutely excellent.. you can really feel an amazing silkiness on your face whenapplied. After a few weeks, I could swear my skin has improved. THANK HEAVENS NO SCENT! I''m not allergic to scent, but they all stink like a cheap you know what. Why WHY do companies use that in their products I won't go near anything with a scent.Thank you Olay - please please don't change the formula- you have a great product here. This is my greatest Moisturizing product by Olay.  If I could I would bathe my whole body in it.I have been using this product for many years and have always gotten compliments on howyoung I look.  I am now 72 years old and still do not have any wrinkles or crows feet on my face.I only wish I could afford to use it on my arms and hands as well.  The bottle is too little and toopricey to do that. As the day goes on, I just put a few dabs of Total Effects on my checks and myskin seems to come alive again with a natural youthful glow. A nice moisturizer  for  under foundation, or just alone. I'm a repeat customer. I love this stuff! This will be my new daily moisturizer. I have been using for about 10 days, an honest pea size amount twice per day, and my skin has never felt better. It is incredibly smooth and soft. I can't speak to the age-reversing quality, as I'm using it more as a preventative measure. This lotion also has a really gentle, mild, but lovely scent. My boyfriend can't get enough of the fragrance! I like this. my favorite Hands down the best moisturizer I have ever used. Soon as you put it on, it makes your skin a smooth canvas for makeup or you can always wear it by itself. It almost acts as a primer.  It actually works better than the Olay night wrinkle cream I use religiously every night. I love their whole line of products. I really like this product. I was tired of spending money on anti aging products and finding out the only active ingredient was sunscreen! I'm 39 so I'm using it more as preventive so I'm not sure if it cures wrinkles but I have noticed a difference in my face, I had some large pore issues and it surprisingly seemed to help with that also. I was worried about breakouts that some products seem to cause but my face has been clearer than usual! Good stuff, subtle glow under my powder. Alas it does not stop aging because my birthday still arrived on its usual day and I'm a year older. Oh well, I like the lotion, it's moisture without getting too oily. great product.I always use Oil Of Olay.I love there products I have adult acne prone skin and feel like I've tried every moderately priced moisturizer under the sun. I've tried expensive creams, but I have a hard time spending $40+ on a bottle of moisturizer I will go through in a month.  I keep trying other products hoping they will work as well as Total Effects, but I keep coming back to this one because it is so reliable. It is one of the few moisturizers that doesn't make me breakout, rubs in cleanly, no greasy feeling and doesn't feel like it's just 'sitting' on my skin. My combination acne-prone skin feels supple and hydrated when I used this moisturizer.  It is my go-to.My skin tends to get breakouts when I used the SPF formulation of this moisturizer, so for my acne-prone skin I prefer the non-SPF version.  Maybe it's psychological, but I feel like it makes my skin a little more greasy and clogged. I was really impressed with this moisturizer.  I saw all the positive reviews (I don't have a lot of experience with Olay products at all) and decided to try it.  I used it at night on facial dry skin, and after one day my skin was almost totally normal, no dryness - it was actually kind of incredible!  Nice clean scent, not overpowering at all, absorbs in well, is not oily, etc.  I would buy this again. I've been using this product for years.I'm 64 years old and people think I'm in my upper  40's  or low 50's.  My mom used the original O of  O, when she died at 84 she had the complexion  of a 40 year old .  She got me started on it in my 20's.  I won't use anything else. To all the older folks out there I would recommend you use this product it work really well, I'm 52 yrs.old and I don't look my age bcause I use the olay anti aging products and they work for me so I think you guys should try it too. Love the stuff! During my life, I've tried all kinds of face cream. I've tried the very expensive, moderately priced and the cheap. This is the best at what it does. My face turns bright red from anything with SPF so, mostly, I've avoided it. This version does not have SPF. LOVE this stuff but I have had to crack the top off to get the last of the cream out. Best stuff all around. Wish it came in a jar like the night cream does. This is AWESOME moisturizer. I am 62 and use it all the time.I have extremely sensitive skin and this stuff has been the greatest. Keeps my face really soft. Have no wrinkles yet. Been using it for years. Love OLAY PRODUCTS. I have been using it for 4 months so far and I like it. It's smooth, not too oily and kind to my skin. My skin texture seems to have improved over the last 2 months.I'm a fan of the pump bottle. Some online cosmetics experts (e.g. Paula's Choice) would strongly advise against jar packaging as the active ingredients will oxidize. The pump packaging minimizes exposure to air, thumb up. Love this moisturizer.  I have been using Olay products for years and have always been happy with their performance. Feels like silk on your skin great product thanks olay This is my daily moisturizer, and I couldn't be more pleased! It soaks in thoroughly and quickly, and does't leave my face feeling sticky. It also doesn't have a strong fragrance which is great for my sensitive skin. I have noticed that the fine lines starting to develop on my forehead and around my lips disappeared after a week or two of use. This is now a staple of my beauty routine. This is the only face cream that makes my face feel moisturized.  I have tried so many others, even some of the more expensive department store brands, and this one is the best one.  It has SPF too which is an added bonus.  I have VERY dry skin, and am prone to acne and this moisturizer works extremely well.  I will never use another facial moisturizer ever again. LOVE IT Excellent face cream. This is hard to find! I'm wondering if it's discontinued? Olay had changed the formula to a much thicker one, and it was difficult to spread without pulling at delicate skin. This product returned; I use this in the colder months and my face feels nourished and the dry scaly areas disappear. Also an ""age"" spot is lighter as well. No stinky stuff and has spf for protection. Love it. Have used this product for more than 2 years and i can say my skin has never been the same since...smooth and even-toned. Been using Olay products forever. This is light, yet does the trick. Not my 1st merry-go-round with this product. I'm ordering my 3rd bottle this week. Best moisturizer you can get for the price! I'm 38 and I'm getting to the age where the fine lines and wrinkles should be starting to appear and this moisturizer has made my fine lines in the corners of my eyes virtually disappear! I have used this product off and on for many years.  It suits my skin just right. I'm a cosmetic/beauty product nut & love trying all different brands & types of products, including moisturizers. Hands down this is the moisturizer I return to every time! Its thick enough to really hydrate my skin yet it doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy. It also doesn't flake off my face after application when I apply primer and foundation, like several other products I have tried. Tops! Hands down! It really works. I had a lot of people ask me if I lost weight, and say you don't have any wrinkles, that I have great skin.... I am 53 years old, and a Cancer patient , just been told in remission.... And those treatments really do a number on your skin. And no one knew I was getting treatments. My skin glowed.... It served its purpose (to moisturize). I've been using it for three months now, and I never had a problem with it irritating my skin or breaking out pimples. The moisturizer feels clean and hydrating, and not oily and gross. I've also notice my pores to be tighter, and it makes my skin a lot smoother in relation to the other moisturizers that I've bot in the past.I would definitely recommend this product, and continue buying it. This is my 2nd purchase. Very happy with the shipping. I carry this lotion with me all the time. This is fairly inexpensive and works very well for my skin. Used this product for years. I love it! Great lotion for the price. Love great My skin looks tighter and I daresay it even glows a bit after a month using this. I noticed changes within a few days, really. I will buy again. Love the product,and the price you offer,better than buying in the store.Wal-Mart. I 've used Olay for years. It's not greasy & works wonders.  I am 65 years old & work at a teaching hospital  Every year when the new residents arrive our favorite game is guess the Social worker's age correctly & get extra credit.  It's worth every cent I pay for Olay as very seldom do the residents guess even close to 65 Clearly helps with fine lines and age spots. I feel like the overall skin tone is better with Olay total effects. I have been using this moisturizer for 10 years and I love it. I always try new ones but always come back to this one. if you have sensitive skin, you will never have to worry about this product irritating your skin. i have highly sensitive skin and do not use anything else. Product is truly fragrance free. It is hydrating, but not overly greasy - doesn't leave a residue at all! My face can definitely tell when I forget to moisturize, my skin feels hard and dry, and my foundation doesn't apply as nicely! This product doesn't clog my pores and keeps my skin soft but firm. I've been using this product for years and love it! I've used olay for the last 20 years. I have tried other products, but I keep coming back to Olay! Ladies, USE sunscreen! I'm 37, take good care of my skin and I promise you if you use sunscreen, don't smoke, drink water (not soda) you will look younger and your skin will thank you! This product is great, goes on smooth and doesn't irritate my skin at all. Is very good, summer needs, and the price is right, just cosmetics class goods mailed to China, the customs will be used for a long time to check, the result is not sent on time, but the question is can be understood. Perfect.  Exactly as described and it works really well.  All you need is a touch.  I am 41 years old and have really oily skin and bought this product after I did an Olay skin analysis online.  I was skeptical to buy online but really, I have no regrets.  Wonderful product. Good value. I like this product. It has no smell. I have been using for over 10 years. Does not have the SPF in it, but that is good for me too. I am really loving this moisturizer. I'm not positive it lives up to all of it's claims, but it has been a good purchase for me. The formula is great and the price is right. Got it thank you.. awsome I love this product and the price is so much cheaper her  on amazon. At my age, I doubt that anything could do much good. I still look like crap but it is not for this product not working. I actually can tell that my skin looks not quite so wrinkly after using. It does have color like pigment of skin I guess so not clear. Lid gets a bit messy during use as the nozzle touches the clear lid and leaves streaks of product. Maybe it's just my shaky hands and short fuse;-) Great cream, has a feeling that it smoothes the skin. The cream is very pleasant and there is no heavy feeling on the skin I like this product it makes my skin smooth and have noticed improvement in my wrinkles between my eyebrows. I am 30 yrs old and plan on using this cream as my skin routine from here on out. Have used this product for a couple of years and Amazon has the best price. I'm 50 plus and when I run out I realize just how much better my skin feels using Total Effects. Olay has always offered great products. There is a good reason why they have been around forever. They are that good. We have put this on subscription every two month. It is a great product from OLAY. To be honest I don't see this as advertised. I just liked it being a good moisturizer. It is not sticky as many creams are. Neither it leaves makes my face looks oily. Magic in a bottle ladys... Arrived with no problem. I've used Total Effects for over a year.  It is cy and provides wonderful moisture.  Unlike many face products, this isn't one which focuses on minimizing the look of wrinkles, products which can be very drying.  Instead, Total Effects focuses on moisturizing your skin -- wrinkles and all!  Highly recommend it! I've tried more expensive lotions and creams on my face, but I really love this one. It leaves my face feeling and looking very soft. I also love the way you just pump the top and the moisturizer comes out....you don't have to dip your fingers in a jar or touch what's left in it. All creams and lotions and such should be this way...I hate having to dig out cream in a jar with my fingers not knowing if I've left any germs in the remaining cream. I recommend this. Love this stuff - I noticed a difference straight away.  I love how it feels going on - I put it on after washing my face at the end of the day and wear it while sleeping.  If it had sunscreen in it, I'd likely reapply in the morning, but I switch products to get sun protection. My wife has used this Olay moisturizer for 20 years and her face ""glows"" -- she is so beautiful (at age 72) -- and attributes her fresh good looks to this Olay product. I switched from my usual olay complete to this product and I couldnt be happier. Just the texture alone is enough to bring me back. I highly recommend! But this bottle is quite small.  I prefer to purchase at Costco and get 2 larger bottles! I love this moisturizer! I have bought tons of expensive moisturizers but always go back to this one. It smells good and makes my face so soft and radiant. I put this on twice a day (AM and PM) and then makeup over it in the morning. Love it! I have been using this moisturizer for about three weeks now and I can already see my skin has a smoother texture and the little lines around my eyes are less noticeable. Very pleased so far. Been using every night before bed and my skin definitely looks more radiant. I purchase this product every two months. I am always extremely pleased. Every aspect of this transaction was perfect. Thank you. Does not leave my face greasy. Seems to have helped my pores shrink on my cheeks and nose, but I am also using a new face wash and drinking matcha tea... So who knows. Still is a refreshing facial lotion! Been using for years, my favorite face lotion. I was recommended to purchase this by my next door neighbor and it is wonderful. First off it smells great and secondly it moisturizes my face to perfection. My skin gets occasionally dry and requires me to moisturize especially during humid or hot weather and Olay does the job to a T. My skin feels rejuvenated every time after use. I also tried this with a facial massager by Cenoire and that actually works well. good for daily use Love this moisturizer, I've been a loyal user for years! I always like this moisturizer. It really works as anti aging and makes my face really supple. It's so expensive at my local drug store. Hopefully the price remains the same here at Amazon. Lol! Anyways they shipped it after one day! Very impressive. It's all I'll use on my face This is my favorite moisturizer.  I've been using it for years.  The Amazon price is far better than any store (even with a coupon) and sometimes I am even able to use an Amazon coupon to make it even lower.  It keeps my skin soft without being heavy and the pump usually gives me just the right amount so that none is wasted. I have used Olay products since they only had ""Oil of Olay"" back when I was 16 yrs. old. At my age, 57, I don't have the wrinkles or dry skin that other people my age have. I occasionally  have tried other products, but never twice. I always go back to Olay, because it feels the best on my skin and does what it says it will do. I do really like this moisturizer. I have problems with allergies and are sensitive to some lotions but have had no problems with this one.  It goes on very smoothly, not too oily and it does a great job. Don't think it corrects anything, but does do a good job moisturizing and preventing in the first place. Love the way this glides on.  Lasts a long time a little goes along. Has no odor and makes your skin glow. goes on smooth and not oily at all. Makes my face feel almost as if a super fine powder is spread over it (in a good way!) This is a real review from someone who actually purchased the product. I did some research on products as I have very particular skin (everything makes me break out) and wanted to find something that would make my skin look better. This has worked. It's no miracle by any means, but it's a good moisturizer that has helped the health of my skin. My skin is soft and the texture is better. I even notice some evening out of my skin tone. And the best news of all...I don't break out from it! Is it a miracle product? No. But nothing really is. Overall I am very happy with how my face looks and I will continue to use and purchase this product. great I have been using this product for over 20 years and it has proven itself priceless.  My face is as smooth today as it was 20 years ago. Use this everyday to keep looking young. Love this product. Great product! I have used this product for several years as a daily facial moisturizer.  It is not greasey or sticky and it provides SP15 protection.It also works very well on the occasional age related spots of scale on arms, hands and legs. This is a Great! Product after a week I look even Younger!!! Thanks!! this is one of my tried and true beauty products; it never fails me. The other night, after using a different (and much more expensive) cream for over a month, I reverted back to using this, and my gosh, I fell in love all over again! I highly recommend this product. It's rich and gives the right amount of moisture without a greasy feel or look. Due to it not having SPF, I use this at night, and use a BB cream during the day. This is what I use all the time  love it I really like the smoothness of this moisturizer. The price was cheaper than anywhere I had seen. The main thing I've noticed is my dark sunspots have gotten so much lighter. My only complaint is that I have to make sure I put this on quite awhile before I put makeup on, or my skin gets flakey as I rub makeup on my face. It will also do this if I it use too much moisturizer, so I just use one pump and that seems to help too. Great product hard to find in stores lately without the spf15 which I feel irritates the skin. love this lotion , my face is mixed and I usually used Nivea but even where I put a nickel size of nivea  my face still felt dry , but with this lotionI use less then a penny size dap on my whole face and it feel smooth and well nourished recently changed to coconut oil, which seems to work even better on my fine lines and wrinkles.  Until I found it, this was the best stuff I've used.  I always need to buy the fragrance free, though.  Otherwise, my skin can get a little irritated. I always buy professional products and this is the first time I tried a drug store brand in many, many years.  I did research and found that this moisturizer contains lots of great anti-aging ingredients and the price was even more affordable through Amazon.  It doesn't have SPF (which is perfect) because I use this as my night moisturizer. ive been using it for a long time now...so far so good..makes my skin nice and supple.  i stopped it a year ago after using it for a few years and my skin changes dramatically..oh well mabe its because i moved into a colder country and didnt use any moisturizer at all after that! It is great. I use it daily and it does wonders for my skin and it's got a nice aroma to it also Great product. I use it daily. Highly recommend. I bought this because of the other Amazon reviews and I'm glad I did. My skin looks and feels much better -- more moisture, less appearance of fine lines in just a couple of weeks. I've used it for a couple of months now and couldn't be happier. Love it !!! I love this product. I see a difference in my skin. Love this moisturizer.  It is not oily and I can't wait to apply it after the shower as my face feels like it just had a drink of water and is so nourished. Will be ordering this again.  Also a great price on Amazon. Great product.  My skin is either too dry or too oily, depending on product I use.  i have been very frustrated trying to find a product that keeps me moisturized without drying or oily.  This product is it.  Love it!  So glad I found this.  Highly recommend. This is the only one I will use. My face is so soft. I love it My absolute favorite daily moisturizer.  My area is very humid. This is not sticky as some have been. I LOVE this stuff! it works so amazingly!  and i am glad I can get it at a better price here than in the stores! it really hides fine lines  it also even out my skin tone that's one of my favorite things about this product. its almost like theres some kind of conceler in it or something. it does what it says .. I always use this product and is amazing, I'm 37 years old, and everyone thinks I'm around 28 Perfect for my sensitive skin. And, I don't like to brag, but since I've been using this, I've been carded 4 times. Winning! Excellent Excellent moisture control, very easy to use and a good addition to my Olay products that I already use. Easy to apply.  I wake up and get going quickly in the mornings and this applicator works well for me.  This for overall skin care, then I use cover up for under my eyes and a quick zip of blush and I am good to go. A GREAT DAILY MOISTURIZERING LOTION TO USE, IT WILL GIVE YOU GREAT LOOKING SKIN AND GREAT FEELING SKIN FOR THAT SMOOTH FEELING ALL DAY BEING HYDRATED FOR YOUR SKIN NEEDS!!!!!!! A MUST TRY TO HYDRATE YOUR SKIN ALL DAY LONG!!!!!!!!!!! I have tried everything. Cheap drugstore products to expensive boutique and department store brands....this is the one. I've battled with uneven skin tone and combination skin (some parts too dry and some too oily/broken out!) and this product seems to even everything out. My skins looks better than ever. I just turned 30 and my husband says I'm glowing and my HS students say I look like I'm still in HS. I highly recommend this face lotion. Note: My biggest fear when trying something new on my face is that it will make me breakout (especially whiteheads which never, ever seem to go away!) and I did not have ANY issues with breakouts. It has even improved my skin to the point where I'm barely breaking out. Was not sure how this would be because I used to see the ones with the tint and I did not want any. Well, this one is perfect and good for sensitive skin besides. Nice texture, goes on smooth and not one iota of sticky. Very nice. Great cream. Love the consistency and I am seeing some results after only a few weeks. I decided to go for the eye cream and face wash as well. With my dry skin, moisturizers are very important.  Moisturizing my face after showering is very important.  This light, silky moisturizer stays with me through the day.  The sun protection is very important to me.  I don't know how I'd manage without my Olay products. Very smooth when applied. Slight aroma but very pleasant to me. I have used this product for years and love it. I have a history of bad acne and this is great for it because it is light and non greasy. Even Neutrogena moisturizers are more oily than this. I've been using this product for 3 weeks now and my skin feels soft.  My wrinkles are not as noticeable. I love this lotion. It makes a noticeable difference after using it a few times.  In the winter,  the skin under my eyes is always dry and looks wrinkled.  This moisturizes very nicely, not heavy. I will continue using. I love this product! my skin feels fresh and helps me with my dry skin I have been going through chemo for the past 2+ months and my skin has become extremely dry with scaly patches. I could tell a huge difference in the first application of this product. Normally I use acne prone skin products and I am very sensitive to most moisturizers, however so far this one has not caused any irritation or breakouts. I could not be more pleased! Has been using for years and works for me, great price, more expensive at stores. This product was purchased for a friend; however, I have not received any negative comments from them concerning it.  I have used Oil of Olay in the past and find that it does what it advertises. I can't have any scent in any derma product, and I can't have any sunblock on my daily facial cream.  This is by far the best facial cream I've ever used and I've tried many, and I'm a guy.  I've used this for about a decade now, if not longer. Wonderful moisturizer, I use it with all my Olay face washes & Olay eye cream..  I dunno about anti-aging because I have nicer skin to begin with...  Not much to say... I love it!  :) This is my go to day cream, and I don't like others as much. I have been using this product for years.  I must like it. I  like it especially because it is fragrance free. I probably won't ever buy this at CVS or wherever again! Great stuff, good price, fast delivery! I can't live without my oil of Olay. It's the nicest moisturizer on the market in this price range. It is non greasy and absorbs into the skin quickly. My skin looks healthy and feels soft. Great product and it costs a lot less on Amazon Its good I was very disappointed when Olay discontinued their definity line and took a chance on the Total Effects line. Great product - it goes on smoothly with no after-effect or greasy feeling. The pump is so convenient to get just what I need without contaminating the entire jar. Like it very much I will never look 20 again, but at 65, I have NO wrinkles around my eyes or mouth.  That is largely due to my use of Oil of Olay products.  Women around me younger than I am are always asking what I do to keep the wrinkles away.  This is it.  I have been using it a few times a week for about 8 years, and I couldn't be more pleased.  Amazon has a great price for the product, and it is delivered to your door.Yes, I recommend this product to women of all ages.  If I had started earlier, maybe I would look even younger. i will never use another moisturizer again! the smell is absolutely awesome! it has not broke me out yet like all the other ones ive tried. i found my soulmate! I use this daily, I have combination skin and it doesn't make my skin oily. always like Olay products. This seems to be working for me. My face is still ugly but it's smooth. Great moisturizer! Not greasy at all! Excellent moisturizer. As with all Olay products very nice to use daily I love this moisturizer so much. Best one I have tried, and Amazon has great prices on it. Very good day moisturizer, creamy not greasy I have been using Olay products for many many years.I like the fact that there is sunscreen which is neededfor golfing and gardening.  It makes this old face appearfresh and alive and wrinkle free. I ordered this cream for my wife. And its excellent. Thanks for sending the beautiful product that's too in time. Hope you will maintain your reputation. I was not really paying attention to the effects this is having on my skin until this morning.  I was doing my makeup and pulled my bangs back and it just hit me as I was looking in the mirror-- My forehead wrinkles are WAY less noticeable after going through 1 bottle of this.  Just ordered my replacement.  I am in my early 30s and I have skin that easily breaks out.  I have seen no breakouts with this product.  I love it!  Finally, I have found a facial moisturizer that works for me. I love this moisturizer. It's fragrance free, so it is less likely to cause irritation. As long as I don't use it on my eyelids, it's great. This is so soft and non greasy. I just love it. I put this on my face at night, and wake up without any wrinkles from sleep. I am 68 years old, and this does not miraculously remove any wrinkles, but it sure makes my face appear smoother after application. Love waiting for lower price. This moisturizer feels great on the skin and I would definitely purchase again. This is the only moisturizer I use This Lotion works really well for your morning routine. I haven't been using long enough to see any big results but so far I like it. It goes on smooth. Works well for under makeup too. I'm 29 and feeling the effects of 30 approaching...so i wanted a good affordable moisturizer. I have combo skin, and this really evens out my tone.  I love it and have subscribed to monthly shipments.  It's great, you should try it. You'll be hooked. Very good product for moisturizing and minimizing enlarged pours. keeping me looking young and gives my skin that glow I like. I would highly recommend this product and will continue use in the future I wanted a regular moisturizing cream for men. Searched on Amazon and this was one of the recommended products. I like that it doesn't leave your skin oil. I am still pretty young, so didn't notice any difference in terms of anti-aging effects :P This stuff works, i ordered on line because in the stores it is 6.00 extra. There's no such thing as a miracle in a bottle, but I am VERY happy with the way my skin looks and feels after 3 months use of this product, so I am going to continue. Amazing product. I have been using this product for 10 years. I am still young but I have no signs of aging and at this point many of my friends are starting. Also helped me through my acne phase. It is definitely a thicker moisturizer. A half pump in the morning and at night is perfect and the bottle will last you 1.5 months. I love this! I use it every single morning! My skin feels amazing! I have naturally oily skin and by the afternoon it is still not greasy! Worth every single penny! Good for tanned face..My skin looks brighter and dark shade is disappeared after a week usage.P.S -I have brown skin. It's hard to find a good fragrance free product.  I've used this for years. Yes I have been using Olay Total Effects  7 in one for a long time it is perfectfor us seniors and I could not live without it Good. Can't live without it. Olay...I have tried other products but I keep returning to Olay for a couple years i have been purchasing this oil of olay moisturizer for around 25 dollars at cvs and am amazed to find it at amazon for around 10 dollars...wow...now i can use it on my chest and hands in addition to my face and neck... I appreciate that I can order beauty products at a good price and have them delivered to my door.  This is a good product, non greasy and overtime will hopefully do what it says :) Great product Have been using this daily for over a year. I can definitely tell a difference in my skin. Its not too greasy. Just the right amount of moisturizer for daily use. I put it on before my make-up. fast shipping  and very nice product  thank u very much Looks like the pic, works great! Tried others more expensive. It's one of the best for full moisturizing. This product is just one of Oil of Olay excellent skin products. I have used this particular one for several years and I still get comments about how pretty my skin is and I am 65 years old. Most of Olays productions are very moisturizing as well as this product. I haven't seen any changes in my slight wrinkles I have so we will see. It also has a light smell, not overpowering. I would buy it just for the hydration part. I use this product every day and I don't look old. Yet. I use this as general moisturizer at night.  Does the anti-aging properties work?  Who knows?  I look about the same age asr than most women with my completion and age group. I've used this for years and I really like it! It helps hydrate my skin and I never have had any break out because of it. Highly recommended. Feels really nice and doesn't leave skin greasy. Not diluted and thinglike some moisturizers, but still feels light and not heavy on the skin I had a really dry skin and tried so many other products which were more expensive than this one and didn't help much. This one feels really good on my skin and keeps it fresh and moisturized all the time. I've ordered it several times and can't be without it. Love it. I love this lotion.  Smells good, non-greasy.  Not sure if I'd say it does everything it claims to do, but I continue to buy it.  Doesn't clog my pores and that's a big plus. AMAZING!!!!!  I use this every morning before I put on any make up.  It does not leave any residue.  It is wonderful, we now keep it stocked! I received a sample packet in the mail a few years back and I knew I had to have this product because of the way it made my skin look and feel.  I highly recommend this product. So far I really like this. I haven't seen any noticeable changes but it does keep my face moisturized. I was a bit worried when ordering this that it would be an an authentic product since the price was so good.  I have been using it for a week or two now and have had no problems.  Just as great as what you buy in the stores, at a much better price! I love this stuff. My wrinkles have ""faded"" and folks have been asking me ""what are doing, your skin looks so good!"" I've started using this plus drinking my water every day. It works! Good product. I use it every day. I've been using this product for years and I have not found a better moisturizer at any price. I use the fragrance free. Great Doesn't make my face feel oily. Nothing beats Olay products.  Used it for decades. Great I definitely see the difference in my over 50 skin. I already used one 1.7 fl oz and I hope the second time around works as well because I abused the sun this summer. Highly recommend this product. Have never been disappointed with any Olay product Olay products work for me out here in the desert.  This is a great product.  Seems to keep my skin moist. this was a good cream for the price I really do recommend this for winter when the wind here in the mountains just dries out my face terribly AND yet gives good SPF protection. It came quickly and was well wrapped and when I had a little problem it was fixed cheerfully and quickly. I do recommend this seller AND the product!"
B00TH7HTD8," As advertised. These are really nice. They work wonderfully on my sensitive skin.  And they don't have a strong scent. My go-to for face wipes. Is gentle on my sensitive skin. I only wish these packs weren't so expensive. nice Will buy again! No fragrance with cotton extracts for people with sensitive skin. So far so good! These wipes clean my makeup off well, leaving my face clean for overnight. No rinsing required so it's quick and easy! These are great for the bedside table ! ZI love them and they do not make me break out at all. They completely remove dirt, oil, and all traces of makeup. I remove my makeup before bed with just one wipe and no need to rinse. I have sensitive skin and these wipes do not make my skin redden, which is important to my skin. I don't remove my mascara, liner and eye shadow with these wipes, however - I tried but they were not sufficient to remove waterproof mascara. Still, I love them! These are my favorite face cleaning wipes. I use them every night to remove my makeup. This is perfect for my combination dry and oily skinned face.  Love it! these work well and don't irritate my eyes These are my favorite of the Facial Cleansing line from Burt's Bees: they have a nice light smell and the wipes themselves are soft and non-irritating. Fast service. Great product. perfect for sensitive skin I don't use these all the time, but they make a nice, gentle cleanser for your face when you want to change up from other cleansing. I'll use them before I go to bed at night when I don't feel like going through a ""getting ready for bed"" routine. They smell fresh, are gentle, & I'll probably buy again in the future. They'd be especially nice for travel. Good product! Wife likes 'em. YES YES YES I have very sensitive skin and often experience embarrassing outbreaks on my face.  These cloths have been a godsend!  I use them in the morning and in the evening.  They make my face feel fresh and clean, but also have been a huge help in keeping my outbreaks at a minimum from the daily contact of random irritating elements.  Burt's Bee's comes through for me again!  Thank you! ok These wipes are gentle, yet efficient! One wipe removed all my makeup and didn't irritate my skin. They also don't leave behind that oily look and feel, so I fee comfortable using them in the morning as well! Great product, I recommend them over any other makeup remover! These get makeup off very quickly without drying out the skin. They also didn't start drying out as I neared the end of the package. my favorite facial cleansing wipes! These wipes are light and do not leave an oily residue on my face after use. I can easily apply make up again after using these unlike other wipes I’ve tried. Would definitely order again. I've been looking for a makeup remover towelette Thst doesn't make me breakout and so far this one has been great!! It has made my skin softer after only a few uses, and it doesn't have a scent to it. It also doesn't leave behind a residue like most towelettes leave! I will be getting these again! I'm very happy with this product. I use every night to take off my eye makeup. Stopped sty infected eyes I use to get by not taking my eye makeup off completely. Very gentle, fresh & clean smelling. Cool on your eyes & face. Didn't dry my face like the others. great Most dental product that I have tried. My 11 year old uses these every night before bed to make sure her face is clean.  Other wipes have dried out her skin, caused redness or even exacerbated her acne.  These are nice and gentle, they smell fine to her and clean her face. I love this product not only is it a little cheaper than other brands but it's natural! The face cloths are also softer than other brands and does the same thing. Will be buying this again! Good wipes but the smell is kind of off. Not sure as I have never purchased this brand before but overall not bad and a good value. But not so sure I would re purchase I have a lot of allergies and this product has been great - no reaction at all. Great Value Love it !! Really effective makeup remover without any strange scents or residues. It's the only one I use! My wife carries these in the car and keeps a pack at home for a nice refreshing facial cleanse when needed. Leaves skin feeling clean and clear. Not drying. Removes her occasional light makeup with no problem. Love burts bees. They do the job and my face feels refreshed afterwardsI have oily skin mostly and it doesn't bother me at all I have very, very dry and sensitive skin and I'm so glad I found a product that doesn't make me break out or dry me out too much. Soothing, and clean well.  Just what I wanted.  I have to be careful, as I have allergies.  But these were great, the scent is not too strong. I have very sensitive skin & cannot use soap on my face.  These do not break my skin out.  My face feels clean & refreshed. Works great on my super-sensitive skin.  I've had no irritation or pain while using these. I have extremely sensative skin and was hesitant to try this, but it ended up being mild and gentle.  Am impressed. I'm a guy that gets an oily face in the middle of the day. Easy way to clean my face and feel refreshed. It's not harsh at all. Works for sensitive skin. I love these, they don't give me any reactions and they clean really well good! Everything else bothered my skin.  These are great. This item arrived quickly and just as described.  Fit perfectly.  Would definitely recommend this seller to my friends.  THANKS!! good My only complaint here is not that I have to scrub hard,  but I do wear minimal makeup.  But the way you end up pulling then from the container.  The lemming is to small for the size of the cloths and it ends up popping top open or pulling several.  Can be a pain when I'm trying to run out the door and I like to grab me a cloth to wipe my face onw to work. love these! Removes makeup easily and doesn't leave a residue behind. These are awesome and cleared acne that was not going away with other, more aggressive treatments! Incredibly soft. It does not irritate but feels great, and smells great! Really good especially for acne prone. Love! the best wipes to remove makeup before bed.become my musthave Soooo soft and they don't irritate my skin or eyes like most makeup wipes. easy to carry and so natural !! Love these! Gentle, non greasy, no fragrance but gets ALL the make up off. keep it in my purse for quick repair and refreshing Great These smell nice, they're super soft and they do their job well. I have not yet tried these while wearing makeup however. If I do I will update my review to reflect how they did but for now they're doing their job well and are a great convenience! Great I never feel like washing my face at night if I come home late. But I know I have to. To the rescue: Burt's Bees Sensitive Facial Cleansing. I have dry, sensitive skin and these wipes clear off the makeup and dirt without stripping my face of natural oils. I use night cream, of course, but it doesn't feel like an emergency to get apply the cream. I love that this has no scent, no junk, and just works really well. Another great product from Burt's Bees. Burt's Bees is a household favorite, so I was happy to see them pop up in Amazon's Prime Pantry. I've used their products for years and find them to be gentle, yet effective. These sensitive cleansing wipes are just right to remove the dirt of the day from my face, whether I've applied make-up that day or not. They are over 99% natural, which is a huge plus for me as with my MTHFR mutation, I have to be careful about being exposed to too many chemicals. very gentle to the face I love these wipes. They are great for when you want to clean your face quickly. Since I shower in the morning I usually use them before bed to remove my make up  so i have a nice clean feeling before falling asleep. wonderful. nice to keep in your bag for on the go touch ups These are the only wipes I use ! They're great for my sensitive skin and don't make me cry when I'm wiping mascara off! I have been using facial cleansing cloths for years. I originally started with Neutrogena and moved on to Walmart or Kroger brand because I was a poor college student, and they were more in my price range. I have always been awful about washing my makeup off at night and cleansing wipes were my solution. Now that I am a bit older (30,) I am a lot better about taking care of my skin and realize that those cleansing cloths were harsh (even the Neutrogena, compared to these) and not a substitute for cleansing.But, after receiving a sample of these in a Walmart beauty box that comes out 4 times a year, I was sold. They are effective, soft, and get my makeup off without leaving my skin with a harsh feeling. I use them before cleansing my face at night, and they are absolutely incredible.Finding them on Amazon was a bonus, and I feel the price was right. It's so worth spending a little (not much at all!) more money on something that is not harmful to your skin! Im obsessed and would highly recommend!P.S. I also use these to help remove stubborn face masks that will not come off with just water, and they work beautifully for this purpose! These are just the best face wipes ever, in every way!  Love them.  No fake chemical perfume, no scent, no irritation!  Cruelty free.  Great quality cotton-y cloth that's so soft and thick. Removes non-stubborn makeup just fine.  Great for hands and bathroom use too, or during the summer when there's no time to shower.  I even carry some in my purse to use to quickly wipe off my table when I go to a cafe that doesn't have a bus person.  Can also be used to wipe down your makeup cases, a mirror, or your laptop.  I even wipe up my shoes and purses with these things.  I know I could use a cleaning wipe instead but just prefer these because they have no harsh chemicals and are cruelty free. I've been using Burt's Bees products for a couple of years now. I have sensitive skin and being cruelty free is important to me. A lot of wipes would give me a burning sensation afterwards or not remove all of my make up. With these I can switch between the various scents, and none of them bother me! My favorite is the white tea ones. For those expecting a make up wipe to remove all of your make up, I personally don't believe any wipe is going to do that. Follow up with a toner afterwards (I use a combination of apple cider vinegar, water and tea tree oil) and you'll be surprised how much make up it removes, even after using a wipe or washing your face. I typically use these at night but they are also very good to take along during outdoor trips.  I don't usually wear makeup as my skin is quite sensitive to many ingredients.  These cleansing cloths don't irritate my skin but, as always, check the ingredients carefully. I have acne but any acne products I try to clean my face I have an allergic reaction to (small bumps all over my face). It's an awful cycle. However these I do not have an allergic reaction to and keep my face clean so no more acne! So glad I found these!Side note: Finally found make up foundation I can wear.... CC cream organic wear by physicians formula! Great facial clensing cloths!  I take these on the go with my while I travel for work.  I like having something like this to wipe my face and just have that extra bit of freshening up after traveling!  I also use them at home for wiping my makeup.  They are not greasy or overly moist like some.  They are perfect in my opinion. I didn't buy these on Amazon but will in the future. I feel the need to write a review bc I've neverrrrrr in my 10+ years of wearing makeup been loyal to any brand of makeup wipe. I get what's on sale so I've literally tried them all. However these are the best, best, best wipes I've ever used and I swear people have commented that my skin looks good lately after using them for like a month. I bought 2 more packs at the supermarket today and will keep buying them until my dying day. I bought these more as a face cleansing cloth than makeup remover wipe. They work great, my skin feels clean without feeling dry or stripped. I worked a twelve hour shift and my face was oily and gross and these wipes did a great job. Little to no scent. The other great thing is I can skip my toner and moisturizer which I use religiously after regular facewash. Ordered as part of Prime Pantry box. Arrived quickly.Purchased for first time to use with my kids (outside of showers and learning to clean their faces with a product as it is super hot this summer already) and to help them as they grow and hormones start kicking in (soon soon). I wanted something that they could use at their ages so it had to be quality, sensitive, no strong ingredients that could dry their faces out and more. So far so good. They don't have anything negative to say (no burning during/after use on their faces and there have been no breakouts; some products can cause and their skin actually looks good/healthy for just a few days use). They are still cleaning their faces normally and in showers too. This was just an added extra (habit started early for tween/teen years are not too far off).No complaints on Prime Pantry or delivery! I received a package of these as a gift and as soon as I ran out I had to get more. They leave your face super clean without any funny residue. Also great for my sensitive skin! One of the only face wipes I have been able to use with my acne prone skin, I like to use it to take off my makeup at night. It does sting a little when taking off eye makeup, maybe they aren't meant for eyes.. but other brands of face wipes have given me tiny bumps from using on my face-this one did not. I have used for a year. This is the only product I use on my pre teen sons face.  His skin n is extremely sensitive and we've had no adverse reactions.  The smell is pleasant,  not at all girly.  He has not had any increase in acne or dry patches while using these wipes. I have really sensitive skin and I find these to be non-irritating. They are convenient to keep in my gym bag. I love these wipes. Very gentle on my face. No more breakouts. I used to use Walmart brand or Target brand and never again. This is the best product I have ever tried for acne prone skin. I have the sensitive face wash as well. People are saying about the bad smell they have. It is not that bad and you get used to it, in my opinion. Great product! BIG FAN OF THIS BRANDLOVE THIS!! Unbelievably soft!  Truly fragrance free and hypoallergenic.  My daughter has ridiculously sensitive skin, and these are perfect for post-sports wipe down to help prevent clogged pores and breakouts. These are very soft wipes. These are gentle and easy to use. My fiancee has tried a dozen different makeup removing wipes and these works as well as any of them! They are very durable and have a nice neutral scent (unlike some of the other brands she has tried which smell like chemicals).I'm told these work great for removing makeup, and they clean my face very well also.For the price you can't beat these. All natural too boot! I bought 10 packages of these, so I expect that will last us a very long time! Good cleansing wipes. Perfect for my sensitive skin. Smells nice (not overpowering), gets my makeup off fairly well, it does not irritate my skin, and the wipes are large. I would definitely buy these again. Just as described. Arrived on time and had no damage. Love these - they remove makeup gently. Great product A Wonderful product. I use it every so often right after washing my face. While still damp, I will use this in a circular motion for exfoliating dead skin off of my face and neck (don't forget the neck, folks!). Works like a charm every time. No smell and lightweight, too. Love it. These little wipes unfold to a very decent size. They stay moist long enough to use and are fluffy enough that they do not irritate. They do not leave any residual feeling on the skin and the smell does not overpower. I even used it to remove a stain on my white shirt. Feels so good when you use this product. fresh and cleansing. So easy when your feeling too lazy to use face wash, leaves my skin feeling refreshed.My skin is known to get very dry so when I use this product and no dryness occurs it's very awesome These are seriously great for the nights I'm too ""tired"" (AKA drunk) to take off my makeup. They do a great job of getting everything off my face, and 1 wipe can take off full eye make-up and concealer with no problems. It always leaves my face feeling really clean! love Burt's Bees - more natural ingredients.  a little pricier than cheap store brands but worth the money for more natural Good wipes, pretty mild and take off makeup, still need makeup removers for waterproof makeups, but good for trips or daily uses. Great for sensitive skin.  It didnt sting and didnt leave my skin feeling tight like other cloths have done.  There was also no sting when I took off the eye makeup. Highly recommend. Convenient Takes makeup off. When not wearing makeup cleans face well. No blemishes.. Does a good job removing stubborn makeup. gentle. no redness, great smell! My nose is very sensitive to strong fragrances but this facial wipe isn't bad at all."

Great price!! Excellent The company changed the product but still works great , only stuff on the market id buy Nice product. It's effective. Great Product!!!Purchased for 17 year old with acne!It works very well, will definitely repurchase. Better than ProActive!!! Really works. Very happy!!! My face was clear within the first month of using this product! This is the only product I have been able to use with success for more than a 6 month period. Before, I would have to switch between Clinique and Proactiv. I use it with my Clairisonic. My teen and pre-teen use this on a daily basis. It is an excellent product. I can tell if they skip a day or two because their skin breaks out. It definitely keeps the acne away. The only product that will clear up my skin! I had already tried the kit before, and it has worked the best for my acne. I've had skin problems since elementary school, and this is the only face stuff that will keep me good. I love it !! would I buy this product again ? YES !! Around September/October I get really bad acne and I have not had any breakouts.face is clear .  Follow the instructions This routine has calmed down my adult acne. I love it and use it everyday. I only use spot treatment when I really need it.  Fast shipping and packaging was wrapped secure and neat. My daughter uses this on a daily for acne and it works great! I am 35 years old and still get acne.  :(  This is a great set because it moisturizes my skin like older skin needs, but keeps the acne away!!  I mostly use the toner and cleanser. Thanks  a lot it came quick  and  it is  what is pictured  and is a great  iteam. I will  reorder I've had acne since I was about 12 and I've tried countless products to battle it. Nothing ever worked so when I started Clearproof I was skeptical. I've been using it for a year now and I love it. It took a few months (about 4) to really notice changes but I stuck with it and my skin has never been so great.  In the beginning I did have a problem with dryness and burning from the system but after a while my skin adjusted and now I use it twice a day with no problems. Around my period I do break out with 1-3 pimples but that's a huge improvement from the past, so I give Clearproof five stars! My 16yr old daughter struggles with bad face acne. She love this product!!! Works so well. My skin has approved so much. Amazing product The shipping came as expected 2 day shipping , & I recommend any one who is dealing w/ acne an is tired of it Use this item Really works ! No lies Make your skin dry but work well on me Perfect product. It worked great for my daughter who has normal breakouts on her face. The price was great as well. Great doing what you said it would do Amazing product!! I just love it. Love! Clears my skin up quick Everything was perfect Good product LOVE, Love , Love this stuff! Good stuff My favorite face application system.  I have suffered with low to mild acne for years.  This has cleared my acne tremendously! Great Quick ship!  Works great!  My son's face is clearing up! Purchased for my teenage daughter and she saw results within a week.  She has tried everything on the market for acne, with no luck until she tried this at the suggestion of a friend. Mary kay works great.  Love it. Thank you Good Product. My daughter says this is amazing. This is the second review i do for this product. The first review was not as favorable but I'd like to take that back. After using this product for about 3 weeks my face is clearer than its ever been in years. I will continue to order this since it's the only product that has helped with my adult acne. And trust me I have tried everything. Really love the product and works with my acne. I tried proactive it just didn't do it's job but this sure does ! my daughter loves this. clearing up her acne and scars. Great price and fast delivery. I LOVE, LOVE , LOVE this MK line. It has worked wonders for me. I know it may not work for everyone and my friend who tried it said it burns...it did sting a bit when I 1st started using it but after the 3rd to 5th time,...it felt better...I fought thru the sting becuz my acne was so horrible...I guess I convinced myself that it was just doing its job...which apparently it was because...It got rid of (dried out) EVERYTHING in a matter of 5 days!! I use the entire line (including the pore-reducing serum, which is sold separately) and now my skin looks smooth, acne-free, and healthy. I get compliments everyday!  Never looked better! Daughter loves This product is great and really works, does dry out your skin a little Work very good This product is great for people, like myself with acne prone skin. it is the best one I like it very much Great product!! Really works on acne and dark marks. The best ! Great product! Perfect Great Works great! Will definitely order again. Finally, a product that works for me. I love this product after my first few days of use.But before I go into complimenting how good it is, I warn everyone for improper use. When they write apply to entire ""affected area"", they mean it literally. Try to avoid areas around EYE as much as possible, because the skin there is much thinner. If the acne is near your eye, make sure you restrict the product to the point of acne. Also, it may be wise to avoid apply to area of open wound until the lesion heals. And just a tip in general, do not touch/squeeze/pop your acne unless you know what you're doing. 90% of the time you will only make it worse, and an irreversible acne scar may result.Excessive drying will occur and it is likely caused by one of the unlabeled active ingredients in the toner (?). This ingredient ""eats away"" your top layer of skin, allowing salicylic acid to stimulate efficient skin turnover. You want to use apply the toner using a cotton ball, or else you will notice your palm skin flakes and sheds.Irritation will happen at the area you apply, and it's normal. Like I said, an ingredient eats away some old skins, causing the irritation. HOWEVER, pay attention to the irritation spots. If your skin loses elasticity or have excessive drying (esp around eyes), stop apply on the area and cover it with a good moisturizer. Once the skin is hydrated, the irritation should go away. If not, don't use it anymore and consult your doctor.Some people commented this products not working for them or stop working after a while. Most likely, they have tolerance for the ingredients or develop tolerance over time. Too bad for these people. They have to figure out other products that will work for them.I will follow up if my acnes all clear, or if I become one of those unlucky tolerant people. I love this acne set. Its the only thing that has worked for my acne, and I have tried it all. This set is amazing! I highly recommend this product to anyone. My skin was cleared in about 3 weeks only using it once a day.. I give it a full 5 stars! Melisa I love it so much but if you have sensitive skin like me but still need a face wash so you can keep your face clean I suggest use it every other day not every day I was using it everyday and it start to burn my fave but since I use it every other day it doesn't and still works great ! I've been using this product for about 2 years now and it works wonders for me! I've tried many other similar products in the past and this by far works best for me. I have sensitive skin and past products would dry out my face and leave it red. I don't get any of those symptoms from Clear Proof. Definitely would recommend for acne prone and sensitive skin. I've tried just about everything as far as acne treatment; From prescription topicals, to antibiotics, to even going through a round of Accutane. Let me tell you, this stuff is AMAZING. If you are faithful with using it twice a day, you WILL see results. I've been using this the past 6 months and have seen a drastic change in my skin. If you haven't tried it yet, give it a chance! The best product for acne ,my nephew ask me to buy it again ,forget about proactive it not wok . I get nothing to give a great review  I do it because it is the true and I'm a very honest woman . The best acne cleanser etc on the market .  Love it!!!! Bought for my teenage daughter at a MK party  and she absolutely loved it.  This price was a little better for our budget and is authentic. Fast ship too. I had completely broken out from working at McDonalds after 7 months. My face had red pimples on the sides of my cheeks which looked horrible. Even with makeup , it looked so damn ugly. My coworkers even noticed me breaking out all of the sudden because they knew I had such a clear face when I started to work their. Thus I decided to buy it. And after buying this I do not regret buying this. This is the best acne system ever. I began to see results the 2nd day. I used it 2x a day. And now I'm using it once a day because my face has cleared out so much and I've only been using it for like a week now since it was delivered last week. This product truly does work fast. I would recommend it to anyone. And for the price, you can't beat that. Products works wonderful on my oily skin Great for sensitive skin that is acne prone! I don't leave home with out it! This is a GREAT product! I only stopped using it because of all the hype about Proactiv. I thought I could get the same results at a slightly cheaper price. I was wrong on both counts. I had the SAME RESULTS while using Proactiv that I had using cheaper drug store pimple pads. But this is a GREAT line and believe me...I won't take that silly chance again! I haven't read through all the reviews but for me, I saw a difference the first time I used this and SO DID OTHERS! We had a MaryKay Rep come to our group and I instantly knew my skin FELT better (and yes, there is a sting...I won't lie! Nothing unbearable but just so you know) but I was surprised to hear my girls say that it already LOOKED better too! By a week in people were shocked...I NEVER have clear skin. I get monthly breakouts that seem to last the entire month. Even my mother said my skin had cleared up beautifully. With all those compliments don't ask why I dared to try something else. I think part of it was that I was still getting some breakouts (markedly reduced though and they went away quicker) and I thought with Proactiv I could eliminate even those. Wrong. Don't get me wrong...I did see some difference using Proactiv but NOTHING compared to this. Their brushes and other accessories are FAB but I only got them (for free) because they CONSTANTLY (and I do mean CONSTANTLY) messed up my orders! (Who needs a FAB brush if you have no product to put on it??? NEVER sent my products on time...NOT ONCE!) This kit has lasted me a while as you don't need much. I use the exact amounts the MaryKay Rep suggested...something I have difficulty doing. When you have adult acne, you'll do anything to make it go away. If they say use a dime sized amount I would use triple that. I know some of you understand but with this there's no need. I'd say the first kit lasted 3 months.I wrote all this because if you're like me, you need something that will work. Spending money, hoping and praying it'll work but getting no results is the worst. When I first started using Proactiv they instruct you to, ""take some before pictures and get ready to see change..."" or something along those lines. I look back at those pics with the huge bumps on my face and I look miserable! Let me tell you...I'm a lot happier now.Lastly, let me say I do have somewhat sensitive skin and this product does sting...it's not a burn like others have said but if you have very sensitive skin I would ""try before you buy"". I have had no reaction from it other than, ""WOW!"" but you could arrange a meeting with a Rep to try it for free or buy the smaller sample size to test it. I don't think you'll be disappointed!I hope all my rambling helped someone! : ) Great product it got my acne under control Love itIt really help!! Its amaizing the change i my face. Very very good Great product great product For naturally oily skin this is a great product. I haven't had as bad or as many break outs since I started using this I love this product. I bought this set a week ago and I already notice how clear my skin looks. I use it twice a day morning and night. Its is not difficult to use, however be careful when applying. DO NOT apply around your eye area I made that mistake and I woke up with my eyes swollen. I'm satisfied and hope this product continues to work for me. I am black and have tried every acne system out there to no avail. I'm hoping as time goes on my dark spots and scares will fade away from using the product. I have had consistent, mild acne since I was 15. I started using this product in November (about a week before Thanksgiving). It is now the end of January (so about 2 months?) and my face has almost entirely cleared of acne. There are some deep-rooted spots that are still on their way out, but my painful zits and whiteheads are gone!I will definitely keep using this product. My daughter has acne issues. I never had that problem, so I have no experience with it. She also has eczema,  so walking that line between treating the acne and not irritating the eczema is really hard. ProActiv worked somewhat on the acne, but really flared the eczema, even with a good lotion. So, we tried this. It works SO well, and yet doesn't cause irritation. We will definitely keep buying this. It works!  Selling my 17 year old daughter on a Mary Kay product was hard but when she heard girls in her soccer team were using it she tried it.  Her skin is now (two months later) flawless.  She no longer needs the medication the doctor provided. A couple months ago my skin got so bad I felt like I was in junior high again. After years of use, the MaryKay Timewise 3-in-1 cleanser wasn't helping with my acne problems. I decided to try out the Clear Proof System and it really works! My skin cleared up and it helped with stopping acne before it developed. I only use it once a day, because it dries out my skin with more than 1 use, and my other washes I still use the Timewise cleanser. The moisturizer feels light on my face when I use it...I actually prefer it over the Timewise moisturizer. And I think the small bottle of the blemish cream is the one that really improves your face. I tend to use the toner less and less because I feel it doesn't help and sometimes develops acne when I use it too often. If what you are doing now is not working, I would suggest giving this system a try. «:::P:::» «:::E:::» «:::R:::» «:::F:::» «:::E:::» «:::C:::» «:::T:::» This is pretty much the best product out there for acne. EVER. I used Proactiv forever and was looking for a product that wasn't quite as harsh on my face. I went through a number of different ones (neutrogena, burts bees, simple, aveno etc.) until someone recommended Clear Proof to me. My skin cleared up in a matter of days without getting all dried out like the majority of these products tend to do. I will never ever ever use anything else. I was impressed by how long the set last me too. The wash usually lasts me longer than the toner or lotion but even so, I only have to order them once every 3 or 4 months and I wash my face twice a day every day.If you're looking for great results without the harshness and without bleaching all your towels and such (I HATED that about proactiv!), you've got to give it a try. Seriously :) I have had some bad acne growing up. I started using this because nothing else was working. It works so good! My Boyfriend had worse acne than me an noticed that my skin was clearing up and I told him what I was using. He ordered it asap and loves it just as much as me :) what a difference.  I had gotten off my prescription acne medication, and my acne came back with a vengence.  Instead of going back to my doctor, which I didn't care for, I tried the Mary Kay system, and it worked!  It took about a month, but so did my other treatment.  And it even reduced some of the wrinkles I had in between my eyebrows.  My skin looks great with make up and, still good without make up. I strongly suggest that you purchase this facial cleanser if nothing seems to be working. It is the only set that has not dried out my face and it is the only one that has actually removed acne and redness. After killing my skin with Proactiv, Clear Proof rejuvinated it I have seen results in jus 2 days!! Am so excited and can't wait to see the result of my skin after one week! It practically cleared up my cystic acne! But guys it can be really drying so jus use daily for the 1st or 2nd week.. try to introduce the product to your regimen  slowly for it to adjust.. Good luck! Bought and used this acne medication. Just three days later my face was acne free and glowing. I have very very oily and acne prone skin. If left on its own I experience breakouts and always have to cleanse and tone. Will keep using it and will reduce usage to bare minimum when I fell comfortable to do so. I have already stocked up so I don't break this journey. And  noticed it is also clearing black spots caused by acne. Awesome product . And  I don't know if this will be helpful, I am dark skinned. I have been dealing with acne and breakouts for 15 years.  I have been to dermatologist after dermatologist and prescribed numerous different acne medicines.  I have tried Proactive as well as other acne treatment systems and this one is BY FAR the greatest! I started noticing a difference after the third day of use! My skin is soft, clear and feels great! I would HIGHLY recommend. Great Awesome product, the only system that has really helped my skin. Only been using it for a few days and can already see a big difference. This system is very drying, so make sure to use plenty of the moisturizer! Solved all my skin problems! This was a life changer it maintained my skin and kept it acne/pimple free. However, I don't think it was just the Mary Kay that helped. I think it's a combination of the things I do with my skin. Tip 1 use this every other day, the day I don't use my Mary Kay, I shower, and apply cetaphil bar soap and rub it on my face. Recommend the cetaphil bar soap. But yeah this kit is worth every penny. I have been using Mary Kay products for years.  I use this for my adult acne. Works great. I buy it for my sons I must stress that it really is important to keep your hands off your face. Don't pick or touch acne and I believe you will see better faster results. I think this is a great product.  Kissed ships promptly. Great service. You are my go to for this product. I was not too sure of this product when I first received it, but after a few days I started to notice my skin was getting clearer. After using several days, I saw a major difference in my complexion. My skin was almost acne free and it was a lot smoother. I love the product and would highly recommend it to anyone with acne, great I bought this set for my daughter in law. She had terrible skin. Her acne would get infected. In pregnancy it would get worse. Her face looks great now. I read some of the negative reviews. Yes, there can be allergic reactions to any product. I bought this product from a Mary Kay beauty consultant. The beauty of going through the consultant is that if there are any problems the consultant can change the products that you are using. She will work with you until you get the right fit. If nothing works, there is a 100% satisfaction guarantee. In other words you can get your money back. Worked great, came fast Love it. I had struggled with ACNE for years. I have used this for over a year, and I gotta say. This works. The moisturizer has worked wonders for me. Amazing ! My face completely  cleared up in a month.  Every week you see progress. I will be purchasing more soon amazing product , amazing service , amazing item, unbelieveable quality Just amazing, works perfect, a company that stands by its product the only brand to buy I would come to this store if I need more. Product came as described, and performed better than expected! It came so fast, I wasn't expecting it till next week. Can't wait to try it. I have sensitive skin ad most acne products irritate my skin but this product works so well on my acne with no irritation. I  have only been using it a week love the results of the treatment set. Clears up my acne very well. I love this system for my adult acne. I read many reviews that people were getting very dry and flaky from this product. To keep from over - drying, I use this system only at night before bed. In the mornings, I use Cetaphil Daily Face Wash and Cetaphil lotion with SPF. This makes my Mary Kay last much longer and keeps my skin from drying out.I do still get occasional pimples and small breakouts while using this, but that is hormonal...no face wash can balance tour hormones. This product has significantly reduced my breakouts and I will continue to use it for a long time!My teenaged daughter also uses the products and loves them! Wow this works great! I am 28 and after I had my second child my face has broken out like it never has before. I tried diffrent washes and mositurizers and I just kept gettin new ones especially in my chin area. They hurt and looked terrible. After using this system for 3 days I noticed a major reduction in the little ugly pimples as much as they are almost unnoticable under my makeup. Just a couple more days and I think ill be acne free. Yay! Plus i have always loved Mary Kay products to thats a huge plus. The best acne items on the market...cleanser and lotion are all you really need..the rest helps as well; constantly using this a seeing a positive difference in my skin. My daughter has very sensitive acne prone skin. Mary Kay Clear Proof Acne System is the only skin care system that helps with her acne and doesn't burn her face. She has been using it for a couple years and is the only thing she uses now. My sister and I have always had horrible acne, and this cleared both of our skin tremendously. I'm obsessed with it. Fast shipping. Works great for my 15 year old daughter.  Very happy with the product. would buy again. She likes the gel Got this for all my three teenage kids that have acne.  Works very well.  I do recommend this product, thanks. I have very oily skin, this works great! Great buy worth the price Great product I'm 23 and have had terrible acne and oily skin since I was about 11 or 12. I've tried Proactive and what seems like every drugstore product but nothing has worked for me. My mom bought this system for me about 3 months ago and I haven't had one breakout since! I literally can't believe the change in my skin. It is a tad bit drying but if you use the moisturizer when it starts to feel dry it's completely fine! If I could go back and give this to my 13 year-old self, I would have been much more confident growing up instead of trying to cover up with a ton of make-up.P.S. I never write reviews for stuff but I had to for this because it really works! It's been a lifesaver! I love this product, only thing that helps with my adult acne. I received these products for Christmas from my mom. I don't have horrible acne just pim"
B01BHQ69S2," Love the smell! Softens my skin.  Love the smell of coconut!! My skin is so soft after exfoliating with this scrub! Also this is such a moisturizing scrub compared to many others I've tried nice scrub for shower or bath Great! good I like the fragrance. It is really good. helps to remove dead skin easily. make skin very soft after use. The first thing that I noticed about this coconut milk body scrub was the wonderful fragrance - it has an amazing subtle coconut smell without any chemical odor to it. The second thing I thing I noticed was when I scooped some up with my fingers that it wasn't as dry as some other body scrubs I've tried, but it was wonderfully moist and felt rich with oils. I love that because it's not unusual for me to have to add argan oil to a body scrub because it's too dry - not this one! This body scrub is full of a variety of oils and you can feel them, including almond oil, safflower oil, sunflower oil, grapeseed oil, apricot kernel oil, and avocado oil. It also has vitamin E to nourish your skin, which is an added benefit. When I used it and massaged it gently into my skin, I loved the way it felt going on, and even more... loved how soft and silky my skin felt afterwards! I even scrubbed my face slightly to give a small exfoliation, and my skin was glowing afterwards! I'm looking forwards to using this again, and would have no hesitation in recommending this to anyone who likes the smell of coconut and who is looking for a really high quality body scrub!Note: I received this coconut body scrub at a discount so that I could test and review it. I realize that this makes my review a bit different than a review where I've paid full price, but I take all my reviews seriously and hope that what I've written is helpful to you. If you have any questions about this product please feel free post them in the comments section and I'll do my best to answer them based on my own experience with it! I love this product. It smells wonderful.  Leaves your skin feeling so smooth.  Worth the $$.  Would recommend to everyone. I absolutely LOVE this body scrub! I try to use only natural products, and I am a huge fan of coconut oil and milk. This coconut milk scrub smells incredibly amazing. Although the container was a bit smaller than I expected, a small amount goes a long way so it seems that this will last me for a long time. My skin was so incredibly soft and comfortable when I got out of the shower, and usually I'm very itchy after the shower, so this was a huge difference. I didn't even have to moisturize afterwards, and the softness lasted for days! The next time I used it I did moisturize after using it and it lasted for over a week! I have very sensitive skin and lot of other scrubs bother me, but this one didn't irritate my skin at all. I am extremely pleased with this product and plan to have to always have it in my shower going forward! I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review, but I can honestly tell you that it's a great product! This coconut Scrub is GREAT!It makes your skin nice and smooth..You have to take a small amount while in the shower Bc if u take alot it's gonna fall n your going to lose some...After applying it has this nice oil feel which feels awesome before going to bed 😉😉😉... I love using it after shaving my legs it has that nice salt scrubbing feeling which I wanted to take of any dead skin after shaving...The smell is nice..just like coconut***MY ADVICE***Wash your face first before using this.. I have oily skin.. so I don't want to add more oil to my face.. again that's my advice...Thank youEnjoy! 🤘 Makes my skin so soft! Love it! It's got a ton of grab which is how i like my scrubs but it's not scratchy Absolutely love this product makes my skin so soft! Love it I love the way it makes your body feel nice and soft and silky it's a great product I have used the Himalayan Salt body scrub, and it was my first experience with scrubs, but this...wow!  The Coconut Milk Body Scrub is my absolute favorite thing right now!  After using it, I have soft, smooth skin all day--even in the dry winter air.  Sometimes I will forget I've used it, and at night feel my legs as I'm getting ready for bed, and they are so soft.  I can't say enough good things about this body scrub.  When I use it, I don't have to use lotions, and I don't use it everyday, but can feel a difference even on my ""off days"".  Everyone has their ""thing"" and mine is definitely coconut.  I love the smell, the benefits of using coconut oil for many things, and this is no exception.  I certainly wouldn't want to run out of it. I love this body scrub.  It makes my skin feel so soft and smells great. I have never used body scrubs. I've used body washes with the little beads in them but they haven't really done ""it"" for me.THIS, on the other hand, is awesome. Omigosh I bought this with the intention of using it every other day, but have used it almost daily because I just can't get enough. It makes my skin feel so incredibly smooth. I purposely tell hubby to touch my legs because I can't get over how silky my skin feels.I will definitely be purchasing this again once my current jar is running low, whch will probably be pretty soon. I love it. My skins looks perfectly shine and soft after using this product!I strongly recommend this product. My daughter has been enjoying this product. It has helped her complexion quite a bit. Thanks for a great quality product. I love this stuff. This is my second purchase. Exfoliating my skin perfectly and leaving it super soft. I use it on my feet a lot too. Keeps them from drying up and cracking. The smell is delightful as well! I love this coconut milk body scrub... My skin gets soft and moisture after I get out of shower. Love it! I will be more likely to buy this again! Thank you Love this scrub!  It smells wonderful and makes my skin silky even now in winter. Don't need any lotion afterward either.  Only use it once a week because of the fairly high cost for the small jar but it is a great treat. This coconut milk scrub does wonders!!! It makes me feel young again the way it makes my skin feel after using it. Love, love, love it! Amazing! smells lovely, good quality, i would buy it again. The Majestic pure coconut milk body scrub is the best body scrub I have come across. It has helped with my eczema, it leaves your skin smooth and moisturized, and the coconut in the scrub won't clog your pores which is what I love the most. I will definitely be repurchasing this product. Awesome product - recommend it without question Loved it! Great product! This product is wonderful. From the fast shipping, customer service, to the quality. I highly recommed this scrub. I use it on myself, and my son who has fairly bad eczema. It works wonders for it, I do not scrub to hard on his skin-but I do rub in circles and it helps a lot. After my son got out of the shower and tried off, he said ""Mommy, my skin is so soft, and my eczema feels much better!"" Right away, I was sold on this product that I purchased 2! It smells nice, and leaves your skin feeling so smooth! Love it! Great gift for anyone. Maybe even think of your children's teachers, they would love to wind down and treat themselves to a nice scrub.Thank you Majestic Pure-once again you have delivered a quality product that is well worth the money. Not to mention, such a great price and FAST shipping. I loved the way it made my skin feel great This body scrub was a great buy. I leave it in the bathroom and its helped my skin even out so wonderfully. My favorite time to use it is right before shaving so my skin is smooth and I can avoid ingrowns My daughter used it before I could and fell in love with it.  Is there a larger jar? Simply put: I recommend this product. OMG!!!!!!!! LEAVE MY SHIN SO SMOOTH AND THE SMELLS IS TO DIE FOR. Coconut milk body scrub!! it is  amazing I love it.

Works quite well and leaves a clean touch, not oily/greasy like others Love this! Scent is amazing. Quality is great, leaves the skin very soft Excelente Love it! Great product! LOVE THIS PRODUCT! It leaves your skin feeling very smooth and soft. I definitely recommend this product! Leaves my skin very soft Love! My skin was super soft after the first use. I have a tendency to rash or breakout with certain products - this scrub has been good so far. Will buy other products from this line. i really like it The scent of coconut is great, very satisfied with this body scrub. It took me a little while to get used to this body scrub because the ones I've had in the past were more liquidy.  I found that if I mix this with a little bit of water it goes on really nicely.  I LOVE the smell, it is very subtle but the coconut smell comes across nicely.  The best part is how smooth and soft your skin is after used.  It also feels moisturized.  I would recommend this product. Love this and will definitely reorder.  Smells just like our sea salt scrub from our resort in Hawaii. Softens skin! Excellent Product ! Left my skin soft & silky. Would certainly buy it again. This is a great product and a little goes a long way. I bought this for my sister.  She loves it.  The scent is very pleasant but not too strong.  It's a great exfoliator but gentle on the skin.  She's extremely happy with it and would buy it again.  Definitely recommend it. Excellent product! This coconut milk body scrub smells like a chunk of heaven. I love love love coconut anything so I was excited about using this. It is made with some pretty awesome stuff also! It has a wide variety of oils that make you skin feel amazing like almond oil, sunflower oil, grapeseed oil, apricot kernel oil, and avocado oil. It also has vitamin E to nourish your skin, which is an added benefit. My skin not only feels great it looks great . I love using different body scrubs, especially when they all natural because my skin is sensitive to chemicals  and additionally there are so many amazing benefits from natural ingredients.  I bought the Coconut Milk Body Scrub from Magestic Pure and  it is one of the products from them is my favorite. I used it alot particularly in my feet last spring.  The product itself is heaven in a jar, it smells amazing and feels amazing! Saying that make sure you like coconut smell.To use I damped my skin slightly, and used a fairly small amount of product, due to the amount of oils in the product you do not need to use a lot. Make sure that after the use you remove the jar from the steamy place, so it does not get moisture. I then gently rubbed it into my skin to exfoliate it and then let it sit on my skin for 5 minutes to absorb the product into my skin and then rinsed off with warm water. It is important to note that you should not use soap after you use this product, it will counteract the product and it's ingredients. I then pat dry my skin and that's it! It leaves my skin feeling very soft and silky. Our skin deserve a little pampering! I never really use scrubs but this one really works! It is great for stretch marks! I love how amazing it smells and how soft it made my body. I have been using this scrub for a couple of weeks.  The scrub has a great scent and is making my skin very soft to touch.  I like that the salt dissolves as it rinses away so there are no beads washing down the drain. good scrub, leaves skin soft and moisturized so lotion not needed after shower I was lucky enough to receive a jar of Majestic Pure's Coconut Milk Body Scrub at a reduced price.  My dream is to become this company's spokesperson because I absolutely love their products!  Once again, Majestic Pure delivers a product with the highest quality, most desirable ingredients, in the perfect proportions to produce the most excellent results:  smooth, healthy, younger looking skin.  This scrub smells great, feels great and is so natural I could probably eat it!  I can afford it and recommend it to my family, friends, and patients (I'm a pediatric nurse).  What is not to love about this product and this company? Thank you again Majestic Pure! One of my favorite products because it makes my hair so soft almost instantly! You only need to leave it on for 5 minutes to actually feel results so it's a fast and easy way to get silky soft hair Smells great. Not to abrasive. I even use it on my toddlers skin to help soothe eczema flare ups. Smells amazing! I definitely see a change in how softer my skin is, and I noticed a lot of the dimples (or dare I say cellulite) on my legs have gone away. I LOVE IT! The best one I ever bought. So far so good. A wonderful scrub...more like a nice scrub without any oilyness Wonderful product. Love the way it leaves my skin, soft and looking nice. Great product!  I love coconut anything and this coconut milk body scrub by Majestic Pure is fabulous! I also love body scrubs.  It does an excellent job of exfoliating without being to aggressive and leaves your skin feeling hydrated and soft.  The added essential oils give a wonderful aroma therapy experience as well.  My skin feels great after using it. Highly recommend I love all the ingredients that are used in here! I feel like my skin loves me whenever I use this, and it's an added bonus that it smells lovely of coconut. It's not my favourite Majestic Pure scrub, but I have yet to try one of their scrubs that doesn't work. They all make my skin feel soft and moisturised. Majestic Pure knocks it out of the park again! I highly highy recommend this to anyone, this scrub is amazing. Adds moisture and hydration to dry skin with out feeling oily. the nice soft subtle scent is very pleasing, not offensive at all. the textrue is a little thick, but creates that exfoliating feel as well as hydrating your skin underneath. You need just a small amount to really go a long way. But you will feel so much better after your shower. Ok, so I loved it for myself, made my skin soft smooth and moisturized. It also apparently works really well for getting sharpie off of a toddler apparently (fades it almost completely). Wish it came in a bigger size though, just used most of it during the whole sharpie fiasco. I really like this product because after swimming, I didn't have to use soap or lotion.  Usually my skin is very dry and even worse when I swim.  This product moisturized my skin in a big way.  Will definitely repurchase. Loved this product! made my body feel super smooth and clean! the smell is amazing too. I love this scrub. I ordered several recently, but none of the others scrubs have done what this one has.

Typically I do not like salt scrubs but this one was done perfectly. I washed/scrubbed my hands with this 3 days ago and I have not had any more dry spells eczema breakout on my hands since then. Which is usually a daily issue for me. It exfoliates the dry skin so completely and just leaves behind child like soft skin.Some of the benefits that Majestic claims and I cannot deny based on my great experience ""Sweet Coconut and a touch of 6 essential oils abundant with vitamins A, B and E and full of fatty acids are all wrapped up in the warm hug of our Coconut Milk bath scrub .

There are defensive properties in Coconut Milk and Vitamin E , which permit them to shape a guarded layer against the destructive impacts of the sun's UV radiation. Dead Sea Salt gives a characteristic yet tender peeling that buffs away dead cells. Almond and Apricot Oil then collaborate to support and hydrate. I cherish utilizing body cleans as a part of the morning, it awakens you and is super reviving! I obtained this item since I cherish the odor of coconut anything and I likewise bought an espresso scour from the same supplier and adored that item also. This item is totally normal to the extent I can tell, the scour itself is ocean salt so it's not going to hurt your skin. The coconut oil revives your skin and gives quite required dampness. Fixings : Coconut milk, Sea Salt, Almond Oil, Safflower Oil, Sunflower Oil, Grape seed Oil, Apricot bit oil, Avocado Oil, Dead Sea Salt and Vitamin E.

It is a natural product with great benefits to my skin.  This scrub comes in a 12 ounce jar and when I opened it, the granules had a nice coconut scent, but not overwhelming at all.  It leaves my skin soft and it feels like I just put on lotion.  It is not greasy, at least not overly greasy.  I am loving all natural products nowadays, so any time I find a product like that I have to try it.  I am trying to stay away from product with parabens and other chemicals and sticking to the ones like this one that has coconut and a touch of 6 essential oils loaded with vitamins A, B and E.  I would buy this product again when this one runs out.  I am grateful that this company lowered it's price so I could purchase it and try it out. This review is based on my experience and observations of this product. If anything changes I will update this review. If this review is helpful to you click below and let me know. Thanks for reading my review. Super smooth skin, you don't need alot! Love the smell. This is one of the best I've tried! I had the opportunity to try this product at a reduced price for my unbiased opinion.  Packaging was not so great the entire container and the box contained oil that had leaked from the container, I understand that it is coconut oil so this can happen on occasion however the inner seal was either not properly tighten or had come loose during shipment.  After rinsing off the container the first thing that hit me was the amazing smell.  YUMMY its like being on a beach reminds you of summer.  The texture is to be as expected for a scrub works great on the feet!!You must be cautious as this is very slippery and will make the bottom of the tub slick, since I planned on using mostly for my feet and legs I sit on the edge of the tub, wet my legs and then apply the scrub.  Soft and smooth skin is exactly what you will get, I can not speak highly of the scent I wish more of the scent would remain after rinsing.This product has become my number one go to especially during this time of year (sandel weather).  I actually wish it was a little more harsh and less oily if you are too wet most of the salt will rinse off before you can get a deep scrub. I highly I received the coconut milk body scrub from the brand Majestic Pure at a reduced price in order for me to review this product. I have tried other products from the brand  Majestic Pure, and have really liked them. I tried their coconut oil hair mask. If you really like the scent of coconuts, you will love this product. It smells amazing. I used this product in the shower after I shaved my legs. It left skin feeling soft and smoothed. I would not recommend using a sugar scrub for your face. If you want to exfoliate your face, use a chemical exfoliating cleanser. Do not use sugar scrubs or plastic micro beads. Plastic beads are bad for the environment since they can't be filter and are sent in to our oceans. They also cause tearing in the skin of your face. Your face is too delicate. But sugar scrubs are fine for other parts of your body. I used this product on my arms and legs. I just used it on my hands to make my hands soft. Just be gentle when you're using this on your skin. I highly recommend to use this after you shave your arms or legs. My boyfriend can't stop touching my legs and arms after I use sugar scrubs on my skin. You won't regret purchasing this product! I have been using Uptown’s Coconut scrub for 1 week now and I absolutely love it! I am a regular self- tanner and I have learned that exfoliation is key to having a natural looking and longer lasting spray tan. The scrub came in very nice packaging, a jar that was sealed outside with plastic and again on the inside with a metal foil seal to verify that the product had not been used by others. The jar also had an expiration date (3/14/18), which I was really pleased about, because of my past experience of purchasing products from Amazon that were expired or about to expire. The jar is 12 oz total volume and manufactured here in the United States. Another really great bonus to this product is that it is animal cruelty free! The coconut scrub itself is lightly fragrant with a pleasant coconut fragrance. I used this scrub before washing and shaving and I noticed that my skin was extremely smooth skin after. As for spray tanning I noticed that my spray tan went on smoother and lasted a few days longer than what it did before using this scrub. Also, while I did receive this product for a reduced price, once this bottle is gone I am buying it again and will definitely be purchasing it for gifts! I love scrubs and this one smells great and made my skin feels great after.About the ProductMajestic Pure Coconut Milk Body Scrub is 100% natural and specifically formulated to promote healthy looking Skin and complexion; Manufactured in USA in GMP labCoconut milk scrub Supports the natural chemical balance of the skin; Softens skin and helps relieve dryness and flaking; It helps reducing the appearance of wrinkles, sagging skin and age spots; It also Provides protection from effects of UV radiation from the sunCoconut milk is loaded with fats, nutrients and minerals that are good for the skin and hair; Being rich in protein it also help damaged skinCoconut milk scrub is not overly greasy, spreads easily, and has a pleasant light scentPurchase with complete peace of mind, we are confident we have developed the absolute Coconut Milk Bath Scrub Formula; If you are not completely satisfied with Majestic Pure Coconut Milk Bath Scrub, we will refund your entire purchaseI was given a discount to test and review this product. What a treat! I tried Majestic Pure's Coconut Milk Body Scrub with the hopes of giving my skin a treat as we transition from winter into spring. My poor skin has been dried out from the cold weather and dry air heat in the house, and it is time for some rejuvenation!This product is very professionally packaged- the labeling is clear and effective, the jar is sleek (love the black lid) and the right size for this type of product. The ingredient list is true to its ""natural"" claims- coconut milk, sea salt and lots of great, healthy oils. I also really appreciate that this product is Made in the USA!Upon using this in the shower as directed, I enjoyed the coconut milk scent and the texture of the sea salt. The scrub felt nourishing and exfoliating without being overly harsh or abrasive. Afterwards, my skin was soft and smooth- just as I had hoped. No smelling like fake scented products, no feeling like my skin had been rubbed raw, and no wondering what the heck i'd just put on my body. Great all around and I'd definitely recommend this scrub for yourself or as a gift. The description says ""There is no better way to finish a shower or bath than with this body polish scrub. It gently exfoliates and moisturizes your skin, leaving it glowing and radiant. "" and it is ABSOLUTELY TRUE. You can feel how soft and smooth your skin is immediately. I felt clean and it FEELS like a natural product. It was salt, coconut and almond oil. I will always have this body scrub in my house. I used it on my elbows and they are so soft and smooth - after ONE USE! I used it on my heels, they are soft and smooth... I even used it on my face and it cleaned my pores on my nose. I seriously love this body scrub. My husband (both of us really) LOVES the smell. It smells like summertime.. it smells fresh and clean. I love everything about it. Some body scrubs are a little harsh or abrasive and this one is not at all. It feels nice on the skin... I can't say enough about it. Downside, I should have gotten two, so I don't have to share it with my husband. Wish the bottle was a larger size! Great this Coconut Milk Body ScrubThank. This coconut milk body scrub is 100% natural scrub! It exfoliates, moisturizes, soothes and promotes glowing and radiant skin. It comes is a 12oz jar. This scrub supports the natural chemical balance of the skin and provides natural support from effects of UV radiation from the sun. I have extremely dry skin, even more so when I start tanning! I've been using this scrub on my face and legs for the past 5 days. This scrub smells amazing! It feels just like coconut oil mixed with sugar almost. It exfoliates like crazy. I scrub my legs with it for a few minutes while in the shower. When I get out and dry off my legs are so smooth and they aren't as dry. Usually my skin will get that ashy look as soon as I dry off, but not now! This is apparently scrubbing the dead skin cells off while in the shower, giving my skin a very healthy look! It's a great moisturizer!! I don't have to use lotion as soon as I get out of the shower on the days I use this scrub! This scrub is amazing.  I just used it for the first time and I’m already in love.  My skin is unbelievably soft - my legs and arms have never felt so smooth after using a body scrub.  The oil seems to continue soaking in after drying off but my legs don’t feel oily, just soft AF!I’m a big fan of coconut scents and this is definitely a good one - it’s not too strong and not too sweet.  It doesn’t linger on skin afterwards but has a nice fragrance while scrubbing.I have sensitive skin so I didn’t use on my face - I feel like it might be a little too rough for anyone’s face but that’s just my opinion.I will definitely continue using! Absolutely in LOVE with this product! I used in combination with the hair mask also provided by the same company. The smell is so heavenly and my hair didn't dry out after using it as it does with most products. Loved it overall! Such a nice scrub. Makes my skin feel soft and smooth!**I received this free or discounted for testing and reviewing the product.

I love that it is a medium-sized granule soaked in healthy coconut oil.  I use a body scrub every day, so, when, I received #coconutmilkscrub at a low or reduced rate, I could not wait to try it.  I highly recommend #coconutmilkscrub after using it on my entire body and finding it to be top of the line.  I used it at night, knew I loved it instantly, and loved the way my skin felt the next morning. This is the BEST body scrub that I have ever purchased. It makes my skin so soft and it glows. The only downfall is the jar is tiny. I will continue to purchase because it is that good but it is EXPENSIVE for what you get. I deserve to be soft so that is my rationalization.

I love the scent to this, and it really is effective at getting that dead skin off.

First I want to say that I have received this product for a reduced price, to write truthful reviews. This scrub me really pleased! I have very often allergy. I'm aching that may be allergic to this scrub because it is the smell of coconut. Coconut often smells strongly sugary. But no! The smell was very gentle and pleasant.

It’s a loose scrub almost like sand that feels fine and grainy. It’s bright white and smells delicious.  The scent of coconut is undeniable which I could bask in all day.  The scent is also noticeable on your skin after washing and drying.  After using it, it left my skin radiant and glowing.  For real!  I could see and feel the protective barrier mentioned in the product description.  My Skin felt moisturized, soft and smooth.  It felt as if I applied a thick moisturizing cream to my body.  All this AND it’s a wonderful exfoliator to boot.  The label on my jar was affixed upside down which I thought was odd but that didn’t affect my review. Who doesn't love a soothing spa at home? I am from Asia and I can't think of a single reason why someone will not like the scent of coconut! I know, I love the smell and I'm sure many of us are aware of the benefits of coconut. coconut oil/milk is undoubtedly one of the best skincare and body care product.I have received this item for discounted price however, it didn't affect my review of this product.

The scrub was not harsh or rough on my skin. It left  my skin very soft. I highly recommend this product. I bought this for my cousin through amazon review trader and she LOVES it! She has already used it three times and is more than happy with the product. I told her AMAZON HAS EVERYTHING.She asked for more for christmas I love this body scrub.  I use it about three times a week. It makes my skin smooth and supple. Exfoliation is a benefit along with a wonderful scent.  It makes it easier to shave my legs, no bumps after shaving!

Bought this as a surprise for my wife. She was pleasantly surprised how good her skin felt afterward. She did need help reaching areas on her back. Since I was the only person available I helped out. It would be nice to have some more detailed instruction on proper usage technique for those new to this type of product. Absolutely love the body scrub. It smells amazing. It did a great job exfoliating my skin and the coconut milk then moisturized it. I loved how my skin felt after using it. I was provided a discount to review this product. This product is wonderful!! I got it at a fantastic discount, but it would have been worth paying full price! It leaves my skin feeling smooth and beautiful, and it smells incredible. The smell is natural and clean, you can tell that there are no fake scents added. By far the best exfoliating scrub I've ever used. I will definitely be purchasing again. It smells like the Caribbean in a jar. It leaves your skin with a slight oil feeling, but not at all in a greasy disgusting way but more in a moisturizing way. I absolutely do love this item. Especially the smell. I purchased this product for a reduced rate.  I just love it.  The difference in the texture of your skin is immediately noticeably.  My skin feels so soft like a baby's bottom.  I highly commend this product. first of all , the smell is amazing. i would buy this over and over again just for the smell. i used it on my hands first and my hands became super soft ! I have not used this myself. It was bought as a gift for my wife. She regularly thanks me for it. I would buy it again and I know she will too Nice! Makes my skin feel very soft and so very nice! Smells amazing, and my husband is even using it a lit bit :-) Keep up the wonderful work and make a lot more of this awesome scrub! I can't get enough of this scrub. Its my go to right along with my coffee scrub by them! Smells heavenly and leaves my skin so soft and free of dry patches. Gentle enough for my psoriasis even!! Was a gift... they live it. Definitely a fantastic scrub! Leaves skin so soft and happy  : )  I highly recommend. I got this product as a discount but I love it.  It smells so good and the scrub helps to exfoliate all the dead skin.  Most body scrubs are harsh on my body.  They often hurt and I end up with irritated, dry, rashy skin.  I love this product! This product worked great. It was exactly what I was looking for. I would definitely recommend it to anybody. I received this for a great discount on AMZ Review Trader. This has an amazing smell smells all natural smell to it no chemicals. I used it on my legs which are normally very itchy and they are so soft now and not itchy at all. I have very sensitive skin and can't handle very strong perfumed smells and this was amazing didn't break me out like a lot of body scrubs do. Smells so good & makes my skin feel refreshed; just a delightful product! Nice foot and body scrub.  Made my wife's feet not-so-talon-like feel under the sheets!Review provided for discount product. I bought this item at discount for my review but would definitely buy it again in the future without the same discount.  I keep it at the sink where I wash my hands.  It has a wonderful natural coconut smell that lingers after you use it and is filled with natural oils that provide ongoing moisture without feeling greasy at all.  It makes my hands very soft and smooth.  I am very pleased with this product. I love almost anything coconut, but not everything works.  However, this stuff is amazing for removing dead skin and making your legs feel so soft.  I received a sample for review, however it doesn't affect my ability to know what is a great product.  #coconutmilkscrub Smells really good and makes your skin feel great. This scrub does an excellent job of exfoliating! It is so emollient and it smells fantastic too! Love the way it made my skin feel. The fact it is all natural is a huge bonus.  The smell is great! Great product just order more.  Using it daily takes away that dry winter skin that you can not find enough lotion to help. Made my skin nice and soft and had an enjoyable smell also didnt mind if someone touched me i knew i was smooth to the touch Love this scrub! Very hydrating and easy to dissolve after scrubbing as opposed to a lot of products that contain ingredients that are not all natural and/or contain heavy oils. Wonderful coconut scent that leaves skin very refreshed and exfoliated. Excellent discount on review trader. :) I love that it's organic Good Use nightly,  love the way my skin feels Perfect for the shower Love it. I love the product. It was really amazing! Love it! My skin is soft. It leaves skin very soft, really like My daughter was given this for Christmas and LOVES it! She says her skin is so soft and fragrant using this. Will be ordering more for her. "
B004CQXZD2," Girlfriend loves these good OUTSTANDING!!  LOVE IT. Yes indeed just as all the other olay cleansing cloths I love them! I love these so easy to use at night when I'm getting ready for bed. Love these wipes, I use them daily. They are moist, take off all makeup easily and don't irritate my skin Great stuff! I have sensitive skin when it comes to chemicals in products. Most disposable facial cleansing clothes irritate my skin a lot. These don't. They are great for travel and I like the overall product size too. It's not as deep a packet as others so these are easier to pack. I'm thrilled because I've been searching for a long time for a brand that didn't bother me and now that I have, I'm stocking up just in case it disappears. These are the best cleaning wipes. We use them twice a day. My skin feels great. Make up comes off so easy. I use these some nights if I'm lazy to use soap to wash my face. I also use these after using my weekly clay mask as I'm not sure if the clay will clog my sink so better safe than sorry. I'd ordered these along with the Simple Radiance Cleansing Wipes for sensitive skin. I opened the Simple Radiance package first and used all of those before using the Olay ones. I was sold on the Simple Radiance ones and was going to re-order them but once I tried the Olay ones I immediately liked them more. The Simple Radiance ones are more flimsy and not as sturdy. For taking off makeup and clay I prefer the Olay one as it's thicker and I seem to get more mileage out of it. I use a few strokes, then fold it over and use the back clean side, then fold again and use the back clean side, etc. I would give Simple Radiance ones 4 stars and Olay ones 5 stars. On nights that I use the Olay ones I rinse my face after and I don't have any change in my skin complexion the next day so it works pretty much just as well as my normal cleanser. wanted something for me to use during the day when i needed it to keep my face feeling refreshed from having an oily face a lot of times during the day or from feeling stressed. didn't use them often but these wipes are simple, not weighted down in liquid, doesn't drip when you pull it out, makes your face feel fresh and clean. i like olay products anyway. use their night cream already. my mother has used olay for years (the creams) and her face seems to glow and she's in her 70's. i gave one pack to my daughter for wiping off make up and she uses it pretty much on a daily basis at night before she goes to bed and says it doesn't make her break out and wants more! i gave her my pack, now i'm without! :) wish prices were a little cheaper though with free shipping. but 5 stars for what i think is a  great product! Great for my super sensitive skin.  No stinging!  Great price.  I love this product! Use on face Morning and Night.  Sure fee good.  Also for hands after eating certain foods with hands.Thanks for good product. MY DAUGHTER HAD SEVERE NODULAR CYSTIC ACNE AND AFTER USING THESE WIPES ONCE TO TWICE PER DAY IT IS GONE EXCEPT FOR AN OCCASIONAL PIMPLE. I was using other facial wipes, and they were starting to really burn my face. I found out the ingredient in most of these facial wipes is alcohol. I found out that, that is the reason why my face was burning. I found this product, and it is alcohol free. It cleaned my face and makes it feel soft all without alcohol, and does not burn my face. So I love it. I've tried many facial cleansers and towelettes, but prefer these and am thankful that they are still available. Pluses: gentle, effective, convenient  for storage or travel, no more make-up stained washcloths. Minuses: a little pricey, may require an additional product for mascara removal, may momentarily sting some skin or eyes, but following with a hot damp washcloth takes care of that. A tip: rotate package regularly to keep moisture well-distributed and prevent drying out. Love it. Love these for sensitive skin. No irritation, ever. I really like these wipes for removing makeup and cleaning my face before bed! Great gift for my friend on bedrest I use a cleanser in the morning to wash my face.  At night, I use these towelettes to remove my makeup, and I love it.  The sensitive towelettes are great for use around my eye area too- no irritation.  This is the best way I have found to remove my makeup and cleanse, without leaving my skin oily and without having to use water.  When I'm in a hurry in the morning, I've used these before to wash my face too, and they work great.  I've also found that they are cheaper on Amazon than in the stores (by about $1 a pack). I buy this combo a lot.  Great price and service for this item.  Much better than buying in a store. Love them and great deal! Many uses including make up removal on sensitive skin.  These are my absolutely favorite cleansing towelettes.  It's a quick way to get make up off your eyes and skin at the end of your day and before bedtime.  There are no harsh chemicals and your moisturizer can be put on after simply cleansing with these clothes.  No harsh soaps, and quick clean up. These are great to keep in the bathroom to remove makeup or just wash your face at the end of the day when you're too lazy to take a shower. A+ Easy make-remover.  I have been using for years.  A very reliable product. Convenient for travel. My easily irratated skin likes these. Best cleansing wipes for removing cosmetics from face! I have been using these for years.  I keep them in the car and desk drawer.  The regular ones bother my allergies but these sensitive ones have almost no scent at all.  They keep creeping up in price but now Amazon seems to have the coupons too. Removes makeup well. I use these to remove my makeup before washing my face. The reason I love these - they are sensitive enough for my eye area. I've had other makeup removing wipes make my eyes burn - but these are fantastic. I recommend them. love them I have tried just about all of the cleansing towelettes on the market over the years. I found these a few months ago and have been very happy with them ever since. The thing with most of the towelettes they are not wet enough and come out of the package almost dry. These are perfect and I love how clean they leave my skin and they are just right for my sensitive skin. Super cleaning ability and convenient. It removed all of my makeup and oil, but doesn't overstrip your skin which is great. I have oily and dry skin.  My nose and the area around my nose is so dry it flakes all the time.  These towelette's don't dry my skin out as bad.  I have really sensitive skin and it works fine. Work great, received promptly. Great, handy face cleanser!  They remove makeup well and are not harsh.  The pack of 30 stays moist to the last one.  They are so convenient - don't want to be without them! You can't go wrong when you purchase Olay.  Since I do not drive, I have to make a lot of my purchases online.  I have always used Olay creams, but never the cleansing cloths.  I find that these cloths are so much better then the brand I had been using.  With Amazon, you order products one day and receive them so fast, that it doesn't pay to go to a store to purchase items. Like others who have said: I'm lazy at night when it comes to a beauty ritual,"" these Olay towelettes are the greatest. It's easy to be dedicated and I surprisingly can tell a difference in my skin and I'm still on my first pack. I'm a young-looking 66, but if you can change this face, you've done something, yes? The best make up removers on the planet! Doesn't irritate my skin. Takes off eye make up without the sting. Whole bag stays fresh to the last wipe with the re-closeable top. These are nice, thick, and soft. love these for taking makeup off before workout.  i do not use to take off eye makeup so cant comment.  gentle and effective. I can't imagine living without these.  Everyday they are what I use ""before"" I was my face.  They do a great j o b at removing the top coat of makeup and most of my eye makeup. They don't replace wash I mg face but they make it better.  BTW great for travelling. These cleansing wipes are perfect.  There's no scent, and it leaves your skin feeling normal. I've been using these wipes to remove my make-up and clean my face for quite some time. I tried using other brands, but these seem to work the best at removing everything while not irritating my skin and not smelling like chemicals or a fragrance. I'm glad Amazon has them on Subscribe & Save so that I don't have to go buy them at the store all the time now! Love this product!  These towelettes cause no break-outs and gets off tough makeup.  My order came as expected and perfectly packaged. I use these at my desk and in the car as a quick face cleanse.  Works really well at getting the grim off and leaving your skin feeling clean and refreshed.I've had bad acne problems since the age of 11 (now 41) and these coupled with the Proactiv and Adapalene Gel really help almost eliminate the problem. It does the job of cleaning makeup, etc. off my face quite nicely.  But what makes it especially good is that it leaves my skin feeling soothed as well.  That is what makes me like it better than the brand I was using before trying this. I keep coming back to these. I don't wear a lot of makeup but what I do wear comes off completely and comfortably using these wipes. They also leave my skin feeling supple and hydrated. A recommended part of the ""other"" end of the make up kit. The only brand of wet facial cloths my wife will use. The perfect amount of moisture. These are my favorite face cleansing wipes. The deal I got them for was much better than I could get in the store. I think I've tried all of the cleansing cloths and Olay uses the best material in their towelettes.  Plus they're easy on my sensitive skin. Great product, great price! I used these when I was in the hospital and unable to shower, and I now use these cloths at night before going to bed. I do not know if they would work on those of you who wear a lot of makeup, but they work fine one someone like me who wears little or no makeup. I love having these on hand.  Fresh and clean feel with no lingering odors. I will continue purchasing these. These work GREAT for sensitive skin. These are the only makeup remover wipes that don't give my face a burning sensation..and I've tried a lot. I used these while in Ethiopia doing medical work out in the villages where there was no water!  They don't feel sticky or leave a residue after use.  My face actually felt really clean after using them.  Will buy them again for the next trip! Great for travel too.  Throw them in your bag and your good to go.  You don't have to worry about carrying a liquid make up remover or facial toner.  These towelettes do both. I use to never use this kind of product but there are just days I'm too lazy to wash my wash and I use only this before going to bed. It works smoothly and I wake up refreshed. great for sensitive skin I only got to use one pack as having a teenage daughter things mysteriously dissapear fast in my house. Use these all the time I'm addicted to these. I never have to wash my face before bed, I just keep these in my nightstand. Nicely moist, without getting gross or weird. Good at removing makeup and grime. Detergent-free so you don't have to rinse after using.  Nice. I have used other wet cleansing cloths before but these are by far the best!. While other cloths seem to evaporate off my skin leaving it dry, the Olay cloths leave my face feeling clean, fresh and moisturized! I use to use these but I have skin lupus I had to switch to something else. These burn my skin! This product is great to take on trips.  It keeps very well in the packaging and does not dry out.  I use it at home when I remove daily makeup.  Lives up to its claim as ""sensitive"" wet cleansing cloths -- is generous in size. My wife uses an excellent makeup but it's difficult to remove.  With this product it comes off like water.  It's a GREAT product! I was very satisfied and thankful for the prompt delivery of this product.  It was much needed and very useful for hygiene care after surgery. Keep these by the bed to remove makeup when I forget or am too tired to get up and wash my face.  They feel clean and do not leave a sticky feel. I keep a package of these in the car.  On my way home from work, while I am sitting in the worst traffic in the US, I use these to clean the make-up off my face.  They work well for my sensitive skin.  They are also so cool and refreshing after a long day.The cloths are not overly moist, but moist enough  They are not sudsy like other brands which is nice.  They aren't oily either.I have oily skin, so use the 24 hour color stay make-up so most times I need to use two cloths to get my skin really clean.  I don't mind though.  I keep wiping my face until I've cleaned every spot.I used to keep them in a Ziploc bag for fear they would dry out in the car, but the seal on the top of it (kind of a removable sticker) is plenty strong enough to keep the moisture locked in.I use the subscribe and save, so I'm pleased with the price and convenience of having these delivered every month. This was a great buy because several were purchased together in the order.They arrived in great shape and right ontime as usual!! Olay makes the best sensitive cloths out there!  Will always buy!  My face has never been this soft and clean. I love this product. It's so gentle but cleans like a dream. Repeat customer and plan to be one for a long time. Love this product! Love it Perfect! very nice and effective towellettes. have tried a number of brands and this is a very good quality. recommend you try it. Love these wipes. I will definitely be purchasing again! Great for sensitive skin. It doesn't irritate my skin at all. My wife loves these and her beautiful face after 70 years is proof. Never hurts my eyes when taking off eye makeup. great for my gym bag to quickly swipe off make up before a work out! Love these and they are more expensive in the stores.  Look at the prices in any other store you choose. only product I use I love love love these! I use them before bed to clean my face. I have very sensitive skin so they are perfect for me This is the only brand I can use. The others bother my skin. It feels kind on your face and great to take out of town with you. Easy to use and cleans well I have extremely sensitive skin and this product did not irritate me at all.  The convenience is just a plus. Love to clean my face with these every day I love these! They are so nice to take camping and take off your make up. Ive told my friends about these and they love them too. I like these.  They are just the right size and stay moist and don't dry out.  I have them on auto-reorder. Use these on trips.  Great after a long flight to wipe off the old makeup and put on a new face. Awesome, Thank You! I use these everyday to remove my makeup.  It even removes waterproof mascara.  Leaves my face clean and not dry. My face is very sensitive to anything I put on it. This is one of the few products that does not cause an allergic reaction. And it makes my face feel clean. These work well for my sensitive skin - no harsh reaction - I use it to remove makeup nightly before moisturizer I am a 42 year old female who has very dry skin, all year round.  In the past, I have used creme cleanser to wash my face (from Aveda, Almay, etc.) and it always felt very tight afterwards.  Then, I would use my moisturizer and over moisturize to help with the tighness, which just ended up making my face feel a bit greasy.  And, every day and night, repeat this process.  My face was so dry that it even flaked!I decided to try this product as I was looking for something easier and more effective.  I first purchased this in my local drugstore.  After my first use, I noticed that my skin didn't feel tight - it just felt clean.  And, I didn't need half as much moisturizer afterwards.  After a week of usage, my overall skin eveness and complexion improved noticeably!I have been using this product for 5 years now and love it.  This is basically a pack of 30 wipes.  It lays on its side, and you pull up this plastic flap in the front to view a hole in the middle of the pack where you pull out one of the wipes (just like you would a baby wipe or a tissue).  You reseal the hole with the flap to keep the product air tight and keep it moist.With this wipe (it's the size of a standard tissue), you just wipe your face with it.  It removed all of your makeup and oil, but doesn't overstrip your skin which is great.  When you are done, you just throw the wipe in the garbage - it's that simple.  And, because it's in this sealed package, it's very portable - you can throw this package in your purse and use it to freshen up anywhere.I prefer this product - the one for Sensitive skin - as there is almost no smell to it.  But, the product for normal skin is also good - same thing except it has a smell to the product and seems to be a bit stronger in terms of cleaning.  I only order that when I can't get the Sensitive skin - I have now started to order this from Amazon in quantities of 20 so that I never run out.In summary, I love this product and highly recommend it. I've used this product for many years and it's great nothing comes close to the quality always my go to wipes I love these towelettes for a quick refreshing cleanse.  The resealable tab keeps the towelettes moist and makes these perfect for travel due to the quick access tab.  Not heavily scented nor oily.  I'd rather use these in the morning or at night instead of soap and water.  These wipe away the oil and grime and keeps facial outbreaks/inflammations to a minimum. I thought I would outgrow outbreaks, but with the climate of the DR, it can still be a challenge.  I recommend this product for those like me who have skin sensitivity issues with many products out in the market place. Removes makeup and eye makeup easily and is very good for my skin.  I have sensitive skin and this product is for sensitive skin and I am very pleased with how effective it cleans without causing more skin problems. I've been using these for years. Due to my annoyingly sensitive skin it's difficult to find products that do not irritate my skin. For the most part I use all natural and diy products. But I really like these. They're one of the ""store bought"" products I still go to when I need to take makeup off in a hurry. It does a great job and I've never had any irritation. I do always rinse my face with water after using. But yes, terrific especially at nighttime when I'm tired and don't feel like going through my whole routine (not that it takes that long in the first place, lol). I've learned with sensitive skin less is definitely more! Great makeup remover wipes for travel.  I love that they are unscented, as some wipes leave a floral or strong scent after you use them.  They work well and even take off waterproof mascara. These are great! I have several severe illnesses that make my skin super sensitive. My lungs are also really sensitive to fragrances and smells. This has no smell to it! The wipes are a good size and are made well. A lot of makeup remover wipes are thin and tear easily. I have no problem taking makeup off easily, including waterproof makeup. My skin is soft and moisturized afterwards without that sticky residue so many regular makeup remover wipes. I love these Olay Wet Cleansing Cloths for Sensitive Skin.  I use these for cleaning my face every day.  I have very sensitive skin and I have to be very careful on what I use, and these cloths are perfect.  I love the quality of the Oil of Olay product and these cleansing cloths are no exception. I at first wrote a wrong seller review on a different product on this product where I said it wasn't sent free, but this is actually scent and fragrence free and works great at taking all my makeup off, including my eye makeup. I love this product! These are the best makeup removing towelettes I've tried, and I've tried at least a dozen different kinds.This wipe does not irritate or break out my acne prone skin. It does not reek or stink of artificial fragrance like others I've tried. There is no sticky residue or any other residue left on my skin after I'm finished and my face has dried. These wipes remove ALL of my mascara and makeup, even when I wear particularly heavy makeup. My skin feels super soft after using these but not like it has a layer of oily moisturizer or anything suffocating my skin...I think that's the aloe Vera, I love aloe Vera!My eyes do get irritated if I accidentally wipe my eyeball when removing eye makeup, but they don't sting/burn and that's admittedly my own fault.This is the only towelette I use where I don't need or want to wash my face or at least use toner afterward. Totally recommend it to anyone looking to clean their face without washing (because I'm lazy at night) --I'm done buying other brands just bc they're on sale or want to try new things. Love it! It saves me time every morning and feels great! I've been using them for over a year and I'm very happy with my purchase. I have tried a variety of facial cloths and find many of them to be too harsh for my sensitive skin. These cloths are a lifesaver. They are wet enough to thoroughly remove makeup and dirt, and they glide easily across my skin. The cloths are smooth and not abrasive. After using them, the skin on my face dries without leaving any stickiness or residue from the wipes on my skin. And after using them my face feels hydrated and rejuvenated.These facial cloths come in a plastic blue soft pack that is compact and easy to store. You get one individual wipe out by peeling back the sticker on top to reveal the opening and then you reseal them by pressing the sticker back in place. I have not had a problem with the sticker not sticking or with the wipes drying out and I have used them for over a year.These wipes are so gentle that you can use them daily and not aggravate your skin, even if you have sensitive skin. I don't have a washer and dryer in my apartment and these wipes are convenient so that I do not have to use washcloths to wash my face, which would just cause me to have to do more laundry. Instead, these wipes, though gentle, are great at getting all of the makeup and grime off of my face while making my skin feel hydrated, yet fresh and clean. does a great job on my skin, cleanses without being harsh These are great for removing makeup. Very gentle. I have tried several ""sensitive"" type facial wipes and these are by far the best.  They get all of my eye make-up off and don't leave a burning sensation on my skin or in my eyes.  I can get the solution in my eyes and not feel a thing.  These wipes come a little too dry, so I just add some bottled water to the entire pack and end up with wipes that are much better at getting all of my make-up off. I use these to wipe the sweat and grime off my face after working out when I don't have immediate access to a shower. They are effective at removing the sweat and don't irritate my skin, which is a plus. They're relatively sturdy towelettes and don't fall apart or leave lint when I wipe around my facial hair. I've used these for a few years now and I love them. They do not make me breakout like any other product I've tried. I do suggest getting them from Target, much less expensive, strangely. I really like these for removing makeup. They are sufficiently wet, don't fall apart if you rub a bit, and do remove all my makeup. (note that I don't wear waterproof, so I can't speak to that). They don't leave a film on my skin--in fact, my skin feels very smooth and soft, after using these. I love to use these at night when I'm so tired I just don't want to get out the soap and washcloth to wash my face at night before bed. I have a tendency to itch with a lot of products and I don't with this one so it works very well cleaning without drying out my skin. These are great on my very sensitive skin. Doesn't give me acne after use, like most other products used to remove make up. The texture is like silk, and doesn't irritate my skin at all. Used other face wipes but by far love these. leaves face not only clean but feeling softer and not dried out."
B06XH6FKKN," It cleanses well with a very small amount, leaving my skin feeling and looking clear. My husband has very sensitive skin and I am hesitant about which products I buy for my home. As a huge fan of vitamin C, I decided to purchase this product about a month ago due to the great reviews. My husband and I both use this product daily (usually in the shower) to wash our face. We absolutely love it so far!This is why I like Vya Naturals Vitamin C Cleanser:1. Easy to pump, perfect for any sink cabinet or shower2. Cleanser is gentle on skin, even my husbands sensitive skin3. Clears my face and gives me a natural glow after wash4. Reduces wrinkles, discoloration & boosts collagen5. Sleek and modern look6. All natural ingredientsVitamin C is great for all skin types and helps skin look healthier, after over a month of daily use of this cleanser, my skin is smoother and I can see a reduction in wrinkles and blemishes! My husband was hesitant to use this product at first, but once he started using it, he became a huge fan. We even take it with us on our travels. Hope my review helps (: This face wash removes every trace of makeup, leaving my skin feeling fresh and rejuvenated.  I was very impressed with the face wash so I bought a few other products in the vitamin C line. I will continue to order from them and have these products as a staple in my home. My skin has never been brighter clearer or smoother. Glowing skin in 2 weeks of use. I highly recommend this product! Leaves my face clean and glowing. This product arrived quickly and leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed!"
B000MUQFTI," very good and smooth I have very pale and thin skin, so the veins in my legs look like a road map. I've been using this lotion and mixing in a few drops of lavender oil and it has made a huge difference. My veins are less obvious and my skin feels great. I've been using this product for a while and this item is long lasting and smells good. I worked in an air condition environment and can really tell the difference between this product and others that I have used. I am going on a cruise later on this year.  I had noticed that over the course of time, my skin had started bruising easily and it would take almost nothing to make a big bleeding scratch.  I have had a hysterectomy with removal of ovaries and cannot use hormone replacement therapy.  I saw this product on line, and the reviews looked promising so, I took a chance.  I have used this product after my daily showers and have noticed that my skin seems to have toughened up a bit.  It does not scratch as easily or bruise as easily, those things are hard to quantify, BUT my skin is definitely smoother, less wrinkled and ""crinkled"" and my skin has a thicker, more dense feel.  I am impressed enough that I bought another 9 tubes, that should last me about a year.  I do not normally make purchases like this, but I really like this product. I love the texture of this creme  - it's thick and creamy - and when I apply my face immediately feels quenched Amazing lotion to help heal and strengthen skin!  I tried so many other lotions and none of them worked.  Will keep buying this for sure. I got this about 7 months ago and I'm stilling using it so it lasts for a long time. It came in very quickly about. Week or two before it was suppose to come in. It's GREAT for dry skin because as you keep rubbing it in it'll take off all your dead dry skin so it's amazing. It also has spf so that's definite a plus. It leaves somewhat of a greasy feeling but it's not horrible so I definitely recommend it if you have dry skin! Aveeno is consistently my favorite product. This lotion did not let me down -- thick, creamy, absorbs quickly. Highly recommend! This lotion works so great! Love it! I'll deff belly ordered again. And again and again! I love this baby soft face wash. It has small scrubbing bubbles, but it's not the most cleansing face wash ever. It's more for the person who wants to preserve face so they can look vampire young rather than a zitty youth who doesn't even think aging is a thing that will happen to them. I cannot comment how much younger I will look because I just started using it, but I'm predicting that I will look 14 by Christmas. This is the best skin lotion I can afford that helps me with my elbow that gets so dried out it scabs. It's the elbow I'm always leaning on to read laying on my side in bed. It is not runny and I don't feel like I want to wash it off my hand after I apply it. Does a really good job on these over 60 plus hands use at night no oder and goes on smooth soaks right into skin YEAH.ORDERED THE PACKAGE OF TWO FER Love this product. Aveeno is always good. I really feel like it made a difference to my face. My face feels soft and smooth after I use it and also looks shiny (not oily). I use it daily so I noticed a tad dryness on my face but I put on my moisturizer right after it so it doesn't bother me. I was an Olay person but I am glad i switched over. Will definitely buy again. First off, this is 2.5 oz when the standard moisturizer is 1-1.4 oz. This is cheaper than the Neutrogena and Oil of Olay moisturizers I was using prior. I'm in the desert so I need a high SPF and this bad boy packs a 30 SPF. It does not leave a greasy, heavy feeling and a little goes a long way. One full pump is too much product for my face. I'm noticing an improvement in fine lines and wrinkles as well. This is definitely a subscribe and save product. Loved this and can't find anything like it. It's gentle and I can feel my skin soft after. I have sensitive skin and done exfoliants cause a rash. I use it once a week on my face and neck and daily on my lips. I love this product it makes my hands feel great and smells amazing! Great Product my old fragile skin has gotten much better with daily use, but it does take daily use for always as far as I can tell so far. I'm 45 years old and have started to seriously take care of my skin.  I've always had oily acne-prone skin and I still do get occasional breakouts which have left some blemishes on my face.  I started trying this product about 3 months ago.  At first I was scared to use it everyday, fearing that it might strip my skin too dry.  I was surprised that it felt good on my skin and left no tightness after washing.  My skin has also noticeably been clearer, with most of the blemishes almost gone.  I love the fresh scent and how those beads work at cleansing my face.  A lot of my friends and relatives have commented on how my skin looks clearer now, with some of them even saying how young I look!  Now, even my husband uses it! :)  I love Aveeno!! Good product I have been using this product every morning for the past six weeks and am making it part of my regular skin regimen. I love it. It doesn't irritate and provides just the right amount of moisture for my dry and sensitive skin. I believe it's helped decrease my fine lines and increased radiance, but can't say for sure as I started to use a Retin-A product at night shortly before I started this product. Like some other reviewers, I did experience a gummy residue a couple of times, but after a light exfoliation, it goes on smooth as silk. I use this product twice a day and have gotten good results. I usually do not get enough sleep so have developed those baggy lids and dark circles. I was hoping that this product would help and it certainly has. However, keep in mind it is not a miracle cream and won't make your dark circles completely vanish, but they will DEFINITELY fade. I have noticed (and have been told) my eyes look more alert and the dark circles are less noticeable. They also feel better too, less fatigued and sore. I'm not sure if that has something to do with the skin tightening ingredient.I use a very tiny amount, just enough to spread around the lower eyelid. If you put too much your eyes might start to burn, so be careful. People with a more severe case of dark circles/bags may need additional or different treatment. But I certainly plan to buy more when I run out. This product is one of the very few that works well for darkness and circles, it could be because it firms the area well. Ihave a big problem with that, so i am always looking for something that give me a noticable difference. The darkness and circles don't go away completely but i do notice i look a lot better when i use this eye cream. It seems more like a serum to me so i also use an eye cream on top of it for moisture. Definitely worth trying!! Use it every day! I  have always had a hard time finding moisturizer that works and doesn't irritate my (unfortunately) sensitive skin.  This body cream is wonderful.  It's not too heavy or oily and it works--stops the itching and keeps the skin moisturized.  The packaging is convenient too--it's very easy to toss into a gym bag and keep with you when you are travelling or on the go.  Great product! I like to try different brands of hand lotion and this one is by far the best. It doesn't leave your hands greasy, it keeps them protected and it smells great. good product I'm 60 with very skin on my legs and hands this product actually works on the dry flakiness of the skin for 24 hours without being greasy  it is quicklu absorbed. Best hand  ream cor very dry skin. I love this lotion.  It isn't greasy and leaves your skin feeling so moist. This is my favorite body cream but it can be hard to find. My 40+ year old skin looks amazing with a bit of a glow. It's moisturizing without being greasy or too heavy. It smells good but isn't overpowering. Another purchase for my elderly mother with dry, thin skin.  She loves it.  I have to convince her to use it frequently.  She thinks it's expensive and doesn't want to waste it.  It is affordable and great. I have used this product for years and it is great. Lasts a while as you only need a small amount, just a dab will do it!  It protects from the sun as well. Very good moisturiser. This is by far the best exfoliating scrub I've used. It has Gentle and Evenly Distributed exfoliating properties.  I'm so sick of the 'special beads' some products claim to help scrub. Usually with those others you can feel twelve or twenty beads circling your face but Come-On, it takes more than that to really exfoliate!  Aveeno feels like it has gentle grains of fine sand-like scrubbers, but feels soft, not harsh or abrasive. Tough to accomplish considering we're actually looking to scrub off a dead layer. Well Aveeno managed to create a fantastic gentle yet powerful cleanser!  I've been using this stuff for years and will continue to. So far it works nicely and it a very good product. I will keep using it and I will get back with more details on the results of the use of this product. I've always loved aveeno products. I always wear a moisturizer with sunscreen, that's a must for me. This leaves my skin feeling super soft. Not greasy or shiny. No heavy smells. Didn't clog my pores or irritate my skin. Doesn't feel heavy. I'd recommend. I've been using this product for almost 3 weeks now. I purchased because I'm 39 and I'm trying to keep my hands looking as young as my face. I look really good to be 39, but I'm trying not to have ""old lady hands"" as my boyfriend says lol. So I use it at least twice a day, and my hands are looking moe vibrant. I also put a lil vitamin e oil around the cuticles to help as well. My hands are looking great. Best lotion ever! I've been using this for years many years..  Everyone always comments how lovely my skin is.  I have no wrinkles and I'm almost 58.  I'm a huge fan of this product. I love this product for my face.  I use it daily and my face stays so smooth.  It does not  interfere with any make upApplicationn and I feel protected from sunlight.  I am seventy- five and have been using this product for about sevenYears.  My face looks much younger and remains fairly wrinkle free. I have sensitive skin and have used this for three nights in a row. My skin is starting to feel a touch tingly when I put this on, but  my skin feels soft and hasn't broken out. The fragrance is quite strong. Pleasant but strong. I like Aveeno lotions and this is no exception. It's light yet moisturizing, absorbs quickly, has a pleasant fragrance and is affordable. I received it on time. No complaints only good things to say. My dermatologist recommended Aveeno products and I love them all.  This scrub is great, though I don't use it every day but rather every third shower or so- it seems to give me the best results that way. This product leaves your skin feeling and looking great without any kind of metrosexual shine (you know what I'm talking about). I have excema and winter here in Colorado is terrible for sensitive skin. This lotion along with hydrocortisone completely heals my hands and after that as long as I put Aveno on, they don't break out again for months. Without it , they will break out again within a couple days. Thank you Aveno! Its almost like being healed! I love this lotion. I am virtually wrinkle free at 50 yrs old but my age was beginning to show on my upper chest and neck with looser skin. I have been using this lotion for a few months and have noticed a big difference. So has my family. The skin is smoother and firmer on both my neck and chest. It's light and has a fresh scent. Have been using this product for years, and continually receive compliments regarding my skin.  It's moist, without feeling watery, or wearing away after a couple of hours.  I hope Aveeno never discontinues this product, as I don't think there's another even similar to it. I have been unable to find this night cream in stores anywhere and am so happy Amazon carries it.  This cream leaves my face feeling so soft and refreshed in the morning.  It's a non-greasy formula that absorbs very well and the scent is lovely.  I've been using night cream since my mid-twenties to hopefully ward off the signs of aging.  Having tried expensive creams, I keep coming back to this one.  Does not cause my skin to break out either which is great for someone who suffers from the occasional outbreak of adult acne. I have psoriasis and used a foam medication that thinned out the skin on my arms so much that they bled just from lightly rubbing over them.  I have been using this cream for a few weeks now on a casual schedule (maybe once or twice a week) and it seems to be working a little.  Was well worth the purchase even if it is not completely successfull. My favorite to use in the summer months especially when out in the sun.  No more sunburn on my face, nose, or forehead!  It works great even when swimming.  Somewhat greasy for me in winter months. I bought it for my mom and after a couple days she said she feels the difference in the appearance and texture of her skin. I see it too! This particular cream was rated the ""the best"" in Good Housekeeping"" a couple of months ago. I thought I would try it and it does the trick and feels wonderful. I am glad that I bought the body cream and will use it forever. thanks !! I bought this face cream for my mom and she loves it. She has a very dry skin, and she said this is the best product she has used in the past 20 years. Skin on hands feel so awesome! I have been very happy with Aveeno products - I use the facial wash, moisturizer, night cream and just tried this eye cream for the first time. I've bought much more expensive products that have had similar results - so I cannot justify spending more when this works just fine.  I find it to be moisturizing but not at all greasy - quickly absorbs in so any makeup on top doesn't slip or run.  I'm not sure how firming it truly is - but as far as a delicate eye moisturizer - it fits the bill. This is hard to find.Stores sell out quickly. This swift seller saved the day. The product really works on senior thin skin. I can't say enough about this product other then buy it. It will be a small treasure to you. After two dr.s told me nothing could help the sun damaged skin on my 75 year old arms that torn off easy in large amounts this cream was able to stop the tearing I can't get along with out it. Everyone I have told to use it have had great results thin skin strengthed Great lotion, wish Aveeno had not discontinued it.  Even my husband loves it. This stuff works...... as a busy mom of three.... i don't have much time for a beauty routine... however I have HORRIBLE dark circles under my eyes.  After a month of using this product, my black circles are almost totally gone!  I really love it!!! I recently noticed my skin getting some spots from age and sun, as well as light black heads. I have started a new skin routine and I use this once a week. Caan't believe Aveeno has disconrinued thia face cream.  Finally found something that works well, and now it will be gone.  Theae are great items arrived in new boxes condition A good moisiner for the face. Thick and lasts for hours. Love the smell, love the SPF 30 coverage. I'm switching to this from a different Aveeno lotion, mostly because it smells good. No comments as to skin benefits yet, though it doesn't seem to do anything untoward either way. This cream goes on smoothly and leaves your face feeling good and ready for the sun. Use it on your neck too! Great product! Whew.  I was so glad to find this eye cream at Amazon.  My local stores for some reason don't have it any more and I was in absolute panic mode.  This stuff just smooths out those eye wrinkles and puffiness like nobody's business.  I have a lot of chemical allergies and can't use a lot of things on the market these days.  This cream I love!! This moisturizer is so soft and light and goes on so gently, It spreads evenly and makes your skin feel really nice.  I never forget it at night becaus emy face feels so dry without it it almost seems to pull my skin.  It feels like silk and actually feels as if it is probably good for your skin.  Wish I had discovered it earlier. Use this regularly on my face...trying to keep what little I have left going for another day....An Excellent Product at a fair price... This product is amazing.  I use it as directed and it has helped with tightening of the wrinkles around my eyes. The product doesn't use plastic beads as the resurfacing agent.  It works great! Makes your face feel really clean! i have uses 4 bottles, i think it improved my skin under my eyes. i switch to Vitamin C serum now to make comparison to see which one is better. i love it and i recommend to all my friends. I wash my hands frequently at work and this lotion really helps to prevent chapping.  I put it on a couple of times a day, during my breaks.  Not greasy.  Very hydrating.  No reaction from my sensitive skin. I am amazed since using this lotion on my older thinning arm skin. My arm skin seems tougher because i am not getting ""tears"" invmy skin as frequently and the one i did get healed quickly. I am ordering more lotion. Good product for my skin. This is the best lotion I have ever used. I use it at night and again in the morning. I am 74 and it keeps my face almost wrinkle free and very soft. I only use Aveeno products on my skin; see my other reviews.  I started using this eye cream this morning and even though I know I will not see results today, I did however feel it working.  I have used other eye creams in the past and never had any sort of feeling that it was working.  I put on the eye cream and then the sunscreen a cup of coffee later before work and I am very pleased with this product. This was a great product.  So sad to see it go. This is a great product. I have sensitive skin, I wanted a moisturizer with built-in sunblock, and I wanted to take care of my skin and keep away wrinkles; this works well for me. Shipped on-time and as-expected, and I appreciated the less-bulky packaging. I absolutely love this. I've always been a big fan of Aveeno but this product takes the cake. I've been using this product for a couple of years now and my skin continues to look great as a result. When the product first came out, you could buy it in the store but not these days; it has literally disappeared from the shelves. So glad I could find it on Amazon. NOT MUCH FRAGRANCE DETECTED - I LIKE THIS CREAM A LOT AND WILL BUY THE NIGHTLY MOISTURE CREAM ALSO Does what it says--resurfaces the skin.  I had blotchy skin due to outbreaks and scars.  This product gently removed the top damaged layers to reveal younger, clearer skin.  I am a fan! This is the only product I've found that gets rid of the dark circles under my eyes. The effects wear off if I stop using it. It also works great to prevent clumping and lines when used under my foundation. A few months ago, I went looking for a new facial cleanser.  I tried an Olay, and then I tried this Aveeno.  I loved it.  I went back to Target to get another bottle.  It was gone from the shelves.  I tried CVS.  No luck there.  Lots of Aveeno in both stores, but not THIS one. Desperate I went on-line to Amazon.  Found it.  Bought it.  Good price.  Free shipping. Fast service.  I will happily continue to buy  through Amazon! Love this product. I put it on after washing my face, it's not to heavy and does not have a strong smell. Quick shipping. Nice and moisturizing without being heavy, is quickly absorbed into skin and has a nice light scent. Great for African American women My skin is sensitive to most products like this so I read a ton of reviews on different products before deciding on this product and I love it! The exfoliators (??) are not too harsh but they get the job done. I use this daily and have noticed a difference in how my skin looks. I will defiantly be re-ordering this soon. This is what I use with the positively radiant facial scrub pads. You'll look like a million bucks! This product helps my skin around my eyes to be smooth and reduce the appearance of small wrinkles and discoloration. I gave it five stars when it comes to firming and lifting.  The only negative comment that I have is it does not help the under eye discoloration.  I will recommend this product to friends and relatives who have problems with bagging and wrinkles around the eyes. Love this product, I use it all the time and it works beautifully. Prompt service and I will order again. Thank you Sorry they don't seem to sell this in the stores anymore...it's a great moisturizer. very good Love this cleanser..I have combination skin and my face doesn't get dried out. I use this every day! Amazing and it smells wonderful too! Does not encourage blackhead formation. Use it nightly Love this product. It's the only I cream I have found that really works. Have tried a bunch of different eye creams and this is the one that works best for me! I've also noticed that if I use it every day, it actually has decreased the darkness under my eyes with prolonged use. Just started using it - don't know yet if it is strengthening my thin skin on legs, but it goes on well and doesn't have a strong odor! Just what I had been looking for that I could no longer find in stores. Aveeno Active Naturals Positively Ageless is good. Wonderful moisturizer with sunscreen.  Feels great on the skin! :) Originally purchased for its anti-aging properties but found that its good to clear up redness on the skin. I can see and feel a difference in the skin on the back of my hands. This is my favorite hand lotion. Goes on smoothly and doesn't leave greasy residue - absorbs well. Smells very nice, too. The only problem is that it comes in a small tube. I wish Aveeno would make a large pump bottle for my desk at work. I love it and use it everyday.  Don't go out without sunscreen. I really like this lotion - no strong odor, no greasy feeling. When used as directed, one can see instant results, price is right too! This is my favorite lotion!! Unfortunately I can't find it in any store! Very nice product.  Highly recommend. I love this skin cream. It has a very pleasant scent. It is nice to use after the shower because it moisturizes well. I don't need a touch up on my skin after using this cream. I also think the price is reasonable. Been using for years, Makes the skin look and feel soft.  Use it at night.  It smells good too. I have tried all the Aveeno face washes and this is my favorite. Leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth, but not dry. Thanks Aveeno! The best ever. My skin is very thin- this helps do much. I started using this night cream after I found positive reviews on beauty websites and a women's magazine (can't remember which one off hand). I needed something that would be good for my sensitive dry skin that would also help with toning (i have a very pink cheek, neither from rosacea or any kind of sunburn and would use cover-up for this purpose). After about 4 weeks I started to see dramatic difference in my skin - it's much more even, moisturized and radiant to the point that I no longer feel like I need cover-up. I also use a day cream which helps with moisturization, but strongly feel the combination has been great for my skin. I'm definitely purchasing again and again, and likely on Amazon, since it's far better priced here than at the CVS pharmacy near my house who is selling this for $23! This has been a great product for me. I read other reviews that were not so positive, however, I have not had any of those issues. I was looking for an eye cream that would work and yet not break the bank and this for the bill. Nice light moisturizer, absorbs well into the skin and is not greasy.  My 60-something year old skin loves this. I really like this product. I get good results and it works well with my skin. Nice Excellent product I really love the Aveeno products.  This night cream is wonderful for me because it is not greasy, and it is very light.  I don't know if it can make a new woman out of me at my age, but it feels good, and my face feels smooth. The aveeno brand is a wonderful skin care line. This works great. Highly recommend this. Very gentle to your skin. I couldn't find this product at the drug store but found it on Amazon.  Love it!  Thanks! I am a huge fan of Aveeno products and this scrub is amazing. It is more on the gentle side, but I prefer that. It leaves my skin feeling clean and healthy. I have been using this for months and plan to continue using it. This product is wonderful for your skin care Scrubs gently.  Moisturizes.  Seems to minimize pores.  Hurray! Erotica great will be purchasing again in the near future Very good product. I used for years and I did not got any wrinkle. I have been using this product for years. This does not leave my skin oily and is light on my face. Amazon gives the best price and with prime shipping it's the best deal. Really really like this.  It's a little greasy at first but within minutes there is a noticeable difference.  I can see this making a big difference in eye droop when used daily. Great product! Please do not discontinue Excellent product...so sad that it is being discontinued! I love Aveeno products and this one proves why. Gentle to the skin while it exfoliates. No redness, no irritation. Love and miss this product. I have been using this product for 5 years. I like the texture, it is smooth soothing for my skin. Works well. Nice product. I love this product please bring it back into the stores I've been using this for over a year now.  I love having a higher SPF on my face daily.  I always feel like this makes my skin glow.  I like Aveeno. The Aveeno product line is excellent for skin that is prone to eczema.  I love all their products. This is the second time I've bought this night cream, simply because it's really good! It is not too heavy, has just a very light scent and leaves my skin feeling very smooth and soft. Love it Perfect for my skin! I've been using this line of Aveeno's cleanser and moisturizer - and have received numerous compliments on my skin.  My skin is youthful, vibrant, and healthy.  Don't need to wear very much make-up at all and I look great!!! Sees to help strengthen my forearms as I have thinning skin. I sue this everyday after  shower and really seems to help. Very moisturizing and smooth I look forward to washing my face when I use this cleanser, the exfoliating feels really good.  It doesn't redden my skin but leaves it kinda 'glowy.' I haven't met an Aveeno product I haven't liked yet. Best facial cleansing product ever😀 Wish they would resume making this product Worked awesome Great product! I have been using this lotion for the passed 3 years now, and I love it.  It's thick and keeps the skin moisturized all day.  I'm about to turn 31, and when I first started using this product I thought, I'd better get an early start to prevent aging skin.  So far, so good for what I can tell.  I use it on my entire body including my face, but only on the face at night.  During the day, I use the Aveeno moisturizing cream with SPF 30.  I do recommend this product for healthy moisturized skin. I love, love love this stuff! Keeps my skin feeling really great, doesn't dry it out, but isn't oily either. I have very, very sensitive skin, and I've had zero issues with this. This product rivals any of the big brand name expensive moisturizers I've tried.  I'm noticing as winter arrives I tend to apply two layers, but completely perfect for summer! Okay, lets be honest. My skin is dreadful. One day I am oily, the next day I am peeling like a lizard. I needed to find a scrub I could use daily in the shower so I gave this one a shot. I am so happy I did! It is gentle, smells clean and fresh and has kept my skin more balanced and does not leave me looking red and blotchy, ever. This scrub could not be more perfect for me and I will definitely will be buying it again. Very happy with this product. My mother in law loves this sunblock facial lotion. She asked me to buy this and only this for her. Smooth & silky! Have used this for years and love it! Works well, leaves face moisturized, soft and smooth. Second time purchasing product - still happy with it. Great Love this. It makes my face feel so clean and soft. I also use it on my hands Great product Aveeno products have been a game-changer for my complexion and appearance.  The smell is also so clean and fresh that it is addicting! This is a wonderful product-I use it as a body cream and the texture and appearance of my skin, particularly on my hands and chest, has improved remarkably Have used this for years and really love it.  This was a great price and the service was excellent. Not much to say, I love their night products and this is not disappointing. It spreads on the face very quickly, but it makes a definite protective layer that you can feel even in the morning. Skin is hydrated and feels smooth. Don't have comments about long terms use since I just got it a few days ago, but I've been using it every night since. Thanks Very good daily cleanser that is not harsh on the skin. Delicate scent that won't irritate you. Have used it for years.  Great product and prompt delivery Gentle but effective exfoliation --especially good in summer.  It's gentle & leaves my face and neck soft This product works very well for the price.  I've been using it for about a week and I can already tell that it's helping with my circles and making my undereye area look smoother.It also doesn't burn my eyes, which is always something I look out for.I'm glad that I made this purchase and I'll be ordering this again in the future. I am on autopay. This is my new favorite.  Friends have noticed the difference in my complexion. Dew-y. This moisturizer is awesome.. I used it for the first time last week and it felt great on my face. It does not leave your face oily and it is just perfect.. I highly recommend this product... Awesome stuff!! Use at night with moisturizer under eyes. Lifts, firms, tightens; greatly reduces dark circles. I have been using this product for years, but could no longer find it in the stores.  I was glad to see that Amazon carried it!  I use it everyday for a facial wash.  I especially like the feel of the exfoliating beads.  The pump makes it easy to use in the shower. I am pleased with this product.  It makes my skin feel great and seems to do as promised.  I'd recommend this to anyone who wanted to enhance the feeling of their skin.  My only complaint is that the price of it seems to fluctuate a lot. My absolute favorite face moisturizer!  I have been using it for years! Works for me. In fact I'm going to order again as i seldom find this in the stores. I've been using it for a few weeks and can already see a difference totally love this stuff.  leaves your face smooth.  wish they made a body wash Terrific product Very cost-effective! Also comfortable! Use some more nights. Just like in the use of eye mask. I've tried different brands. This one is amazing. Love it. I have used this product, along with the Ultra Calming Moisturizer for many years and would never consider using any other products on my face.  My skin looks and feels like silk. This cream is great as a day cream during the winter (not greasy at all) and should be a good night cream in the summer, but wont work now since it's extra dry. Also smells great. Nice and light - easy to use nice package - Fast delivery but a little leakage inside package - love how it makes my skin fell after using for a week! I always can notice if I haven't applied this moisturizer.  My skin looks and feels great. This stuff smells SO good. My husband uses this on his hands to lessen dark age spots and it certainly does help Good. Been using tthis as a night-time moisturizer for years.  Love finding it here at a great price. The smell isn't the best, but I very much like the way I can still feel some skin protection as the day goes on. I love it. Smells nice. Feels light and fresh. My face feels great after I use it. I got so many compliments about my skin.  What have you done to your skin is so radiant and glowing. This product makes my skin feel and look so great! Not only have I used this product many times before, Because i love the way it feels on my skin and absorbs, I love how it mosturises and leaves my skin feeling soft...Also Found it for a better price on Amazon then any store around me. nice good Very good for my sensitive skin with great results. Great to use it everyday makes your skin glow and radiant and younger everyday. Smooth skin and perfect balance of oil and moisture. a great product. described as usual spot on. love this product and i will buy more when i need it as i gave a friend one, to  share a great product This is great stuff because it does what it says it will.  I use in the morningand at night either under or over make up.  Takes care of morning puffi-ness in no time at all. It burns a little bit because it works!  The product does work on the wrinkles while I only have fine lines it did help them ease up it is thick and for nights not under make up. Like everything Aveeno, it's a great product and feels wonderful on my face. Very gentle cleanser with a great smell. I have sensitive skin that is oily and breaks out easily with a long line of brands.  I could tell a difference with my fine lines after using the cream only a couple of days and it continually is improving; feeling firmer and tighter.  A great price, great results and no acne.  I will continue to use this product! I have been using this product for about four years and just love it.  I use it with Oil of Olay's facial brush and it makes my skin feel so good. Used before but having trouble finding it in stores.  Lightly exfoliates and skin feels great. ( I have normal skin, not too dry or oily) Good service: another great product I like that they discontinued.. I have noticed a pleasant change in my facial skin since using this product.  I will order this again. Works well I like this stuff. It does a great job of cleaning my face. Works better than any other eye cream I have tried; and there have been a few! Will buy it again. Love this stuff been using it awhile before purchasing here.  Worth the money! love it I don't use this product for any anti-aging reasons - although any help in that department would be appreciated!My facial skin is dry, sensitive and oily. I love the Aveeno range and this is great for my sensitive skin but exfoliates as well - the perfect combination. My favorite! Wish it was a little cheaper. I am very satisfied with my purchase and product."
B075FMHG21," I love this cleanser! I have really sensitive skin that is dry but also I have large pores and I'm susceptible to mild acne still in my 40s. This cleanser is the perfect combo for me of nicely cleansing my skin without drying it at all. After a few weeks of using it I've noticed my skin feeling softer and looking more even. I was worried at first that I might break out because it's so gentle, but my skin is clear and looking the best it has in a long, long time. It's so nice to finish cleansing my face and not have it feel super taut and dry. I love it!! This is by far my favorite cleanser.  It is made of all natural wildcrafted and organic ingredients.  It is creamy and healing to the skin and helps reduce inflammation.  I love that it has pearl powder and contains probiotics and organic essential oils amongst other ingredients. It does not make the skin dry or tight and leaves the skin feeling refreshed, soft and glowing.  If using it in the evening to remove makeup you will need about 4 pumps."
B0147LDPRM," I am been using the product, since last 2 weeks, and the results are really good; I can feel the difference in my face skin ;) Pleased with this mask. My pores seem smaller and it seems to make my skin much smoother! I'll reorder before I use all of this one!!!! There is so much! And it smells amazing as well. Makes my skin very hydrated and moist. I love this product! Decent price. Made my skin feel soft and nice after one use. I actually purchased this product for my girlfriend to try and told her to let me know what she thought of it and write a review to fulfill our review for a testing this product. Yet, in the end, I showed her the product and she asked if I want to try it, like I have any idea how masks works. Fast forward, I do it, despite how ridiculous I look.First and foremost, I am by no means qualified to review this product, I have no idea what these skin mud masks do or how they really benefit me. If I have a less oily face or less pores or less pimples or whatever from this product clearing it up, I would never notice. My skin health is the least of my concerns, probably because I don’t use make up or anything.So after putting on the mask, I guess it feels cool. I leave it on for 20 mins, which is enough time to finish a commercial less episode of It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia then removed it. I think I had more fun removing the mask that actually caring about how beneficial the mask is.My face felt cooler, cleaner and refreshed. That’s cool, my gf said I looked lighter, I guess that works. So as a male that’s only used Clearasil back in high school 10 years ago, this product works if your SO is complementing the way you look, it’s a good product.For that alone, 5 star product. Will use again when forced to, my girlfriend uses it often. I just Love the way this product makes my skin feel and it is easy to take off and leaves my pores clean and my son thinks it is pretty cool too!!! Amazing product, made my face feel very fresh and smooth! It also cleared up a lot of my acne. For days now, I have been using this product. I was surprised to find out that I had no allergic reactions to it. I also like how clean I feel after using the mask. I feel so rejuvenated after using the mud mask. I also noticed that my skin is now softer too. I love it!!! I will definitely keep on using this mud mask. Who needs to go to a spa when you can do this at home for at least 20 minutes a day. (Well it said use it at least 3 to 4 times a week. But still, I am a big fan of mud clay now! I give this two thumbs up ! Received this product at discount, in exchange of my unbiased and honest opinion. ---Reviewed by the one and only Mrs. DM This product will change your face forever. It's absolutely unbelievable and does everything it says it does. I'll never go without it. Buy it, you will highly regret if you don't. I like that it's non-irritating to our sensitive skin. I have oily skin and my daughter has dry. We both use the product and it creates a healthier balance. What we really like the most is it closes up skin pores. This face mask really works nicely. It’s easy to apply and it dries very nicely. My face feels much cleaner and smoother afterwards.It’s easy to rinse off after using.I’ll definitely keep using this. My experience with the Art Naturals Dead Sea Mask was nothing short of amazing.  The mask was cool on my face and didn't tingle or burn or cause any itching.  I set a timer for 15 minutes and once the 15 minutes was up, I began the removal process.  Typically, I would just use warm water to remove the mask, but with the dead sea mask, the instructions actually state to remove the mask by massaging the face in circular motions.  The mask began to fall off, exfoliating the skin during the process.  Public Service Announcement:  This process can create quite the mess in the sink!  I removed as much of the mask as I could and then used luke warm water to remove the remaining mask around my eyebrows and hairline.I couldn't believe how great my skin felt!  I could tell the 1st layer of dead, dull skin had been removed.  My face was soft and smooth to the touch.  My skin had a nice glow.  The next did I did a few blackheads and zits appear but that's a good thing.  This was acne that was trapped below the surface.  Now that it had surfaced, I was able to treat it on a topical level.This product feels like a spa treatment without the expensive high price! I love this mud mask! Great mask for an even better deal. This works well, doesn’t stink like I expected it too (I mean, it is mud. I expected a bad smell). As it dries, I can physically feel it tightening my skin. This jar packs so much mask! I am on my fifth use and it doesn’t even look like I have made a dent in the contents.Just a side note, it does have a bit of a tingle before it dries, which I was not expecting. Just know it is nothing to be alarmed by. Great mud mask! I been using it twice a week because i feel like it really works when i use it, i feel my face tighter and alot smoother. I have notice a difference using this mud mask along with my other products. I absolutely love this mud mask! When I need to relax and make my face feel fully rejuvenated,  I used this. While there are many dead sea products out there, this truly captures the essence of the sulfer and purity that the dead sea is known for. I typically use this in the evening. The instructions say to clean your face before but if I'm not wearing make up then I apply directly. When I first used it there was some burning but it quickly faded. After the first use, my face didn't experience burning anymore. I wear it until it dries or I'm done doing what I need to do. Ill remove and then do my face wash routine. When I wake up in the morning I definitely notice a glow and how refreshed my face looks. And a little does go a LONG way! Having combination skin, it's hard to find a product that both moisturizes my skin without leaving it oily. I have been using this mask for about 3 weeks now, once every 3 days over my entire face, and my skin has never looked better. I also have really big pores on my nose and have never really found a product that clears the blackheads from them, but this mask is like magic. I've tried so many skin products but this is the first one I would sincerely recommend and send to my friends. Really easy to put on, and easy to take off. The only problem is the mess it creates in the sink, so I usually do it before taking a shower. Great product wow this is the best mud mask ever  for real the quality is great! im usually so picky and sensitive as to what i put on my face but i was all cool with it since its all natural and pure  its also smells great as well, all you need is a small amount and it goes along way! all my friends tell me that my face really glows! love it I went for vacation to the Dead Sea in Israel and when I got back to America I was looking for a mud mask similar to the dead sea mud I came across ARTNATURALS and decided to try it... all I can say is I love it and I try to make sure to use it every night. It is amazing, my pores are shrinking, removed blackheads and my face is softer.  Easy to put on and take off, also very gentle on the skin. Bought some for my daughter she loves it.I have tried so many products, and none cleaned my face like this has. Here is a mask that does work, and inexpensive. My favorite mask!!! I purchased this mud mask for my daughter who has oily skin and is prone to acne.  She has used it weekly for the past few months and has a noticeable clearing in skin and an overall brighter appearance to her skin without looking oily or getting dry. Got as a gift for our 28-year-old daughter -- she loves it! pretty good. very happy it is working perfect on me, leaves my skin very soft and looks more clear ( less dark spots) txs Love it!

I don't use much product on my face in general but my skin always feels and looks more youthful (tight) after using the product. I'm definitely buying another one. Very fresh and moisturizing.  My skin felt great afterwards. Love this mask and will use it as recommended (every 3-4 days)!  What a great price for a great product! Awesome, my boyfriend loves it.

Product as shown I love it I love this mud mask. I use it all the time Good product Works great Omg face feels amazing Best mud mask ever! Amazing! I love it! Great product! AMAZING Mask I loved it! Works great works well Five stars excelente I've been looking for a nice mud mask, because my skin has been acting up and also because I'm severely oily (when I say ""severely,"" I mean that I can do my makeup, walk out the door immediately after, and by the time I get to my car, I already see the ""shine"" coming through. And by lunch time, fuggedaboutit!).As with all of my Amazon purchases, I decided to do some research. After filtering through the products and reading all sorts of reviews, I decided to give this dead sea mud mask a shot. My skin isn't particularly sensitive, meaning it doesn't react or flare up with most new products (although, do keep in mind that I don't use just any ol' products on my face, either), so I figured this might be a good buy.I was so excited to get this in the mail. I mean, we all get antsy and excited for that brown box to arrive at our doorsteps, but this one, I was particularly excited about. As soon as it came, I tore through the box like a crazy lady, and sat it down on my vanity as I sprinted into my bathroom to wash my face. When I got back to my vanity, I switched on the light on my mirror (one that I bought years and years ago at a Costco and can't seem to find online..) and went to town! I made sure to apply a nice, thick, even layer of this mask all over my face, and joined the hubs and puppies on the couch for some Netflix.At first, my skin felt a little tingly. I attributed that to the fact that my skin was probably dry from not applying any toner or moisturizer to it after washing up. The tingly sensations were gone pretty quickly, and I could comfortably relax with the mask on. As it dried, I patted my forehead and cheeks once in a while to see if it was all dry. Once I saw and felt that it had dried up completely, I went back to the bathroom to wash it off. Even washing it off felt nice! As you wet the mask again to wash it off, it turns back into this creamy texture that feels wonderful on your skin. I made sure to use warm water and to get every little bit off, before I pat-dried my face. When I turned to the mirror to apply my toner and moisturizer..HOLY COW. My skin hadn't been that soft since I was in diapers! I was so amazed with how soft and smooth my skin felt, that I couldn't help but to touch my cheeks again and again. I applied my toner and moisturizer, then ran over to the hubs to tell him to feel, too. Days after my first try, my skin still feels softer, my blemishes have faded a bit, and call me crazy, but my pores already look a bit smaller! It hasn't seemed to help with the issue of oiliness, but that's just something I'm going to have to work on little by little.If you aren't sure which mud mask to try out, PICK THIS ONE!!! Give it a shot, feel your skin, and never look back.** TIP: when applying this mask, make sure you put on a t-shirt that you don't care to get dirty! Because I had applied it to my face and upper neck like it says to do, washing it off meant that the muddy water dripped down my neck and got onto my shirt. It was a beat up black t-shirt, courtesy of my hubs, so I was fine, but it's definitely something to keep in mind!If my review has helped you in any way, please let me know, or hit ""Yes"" under this review. Thank you! :) Unlike another Dead Sea Mud by another brand, this one looks and feels like real mud:  thick texture, but applies smoothly and a little goes a long way.  I use a clean plastic spoon to avoid contamination.  The first spoonful covered my face, neck and backs of my hands with a solid layer. Next time used half as much--closer to a level teaspoon.  One container will provide dozens of applications. It dried pleasantly and left my skin feeling very soft, but I still followed up with a serum and moisturizer.  Caution:  this mud is VERY thick and it is easy to get it onto everything you touch.  Wear something easy to wash. Use just your hands to wash off the mud; I do it in the shower.  The mud clung to the loofah I used the first time and I ended up tossing out. Now I rinse first, loofah after. Just received this today and already used it!!! Love this! My skin already looks smoother and feels smoother! My makeup looks airbrushed!! Can't wait to see thru the weeks my skin improve more....a must have!!! Will buy again! This has become one of my favorite masks to use throughout the week. It leaves your skin feeling fresh and smooth and the feeling when applying the mask is super relaxing and almost cooling. I really love the days I get to put this mask on just because it's like having a spa day at home! As instructed I apply this mask after washing my face when the pores are at their largest. I leave it on for about fifteen to twenty minutes then scrub it off. It is a little bit time consuming to take it off as you need to scrub pretty good but just remember that is what is removing all that excess dirt that normal face washes won't reach! Then I go on with my normal moisturizing process to lock all that in. It works and feels great! You won't be sorry. I've used this mask once and followed all the directions given, apply thick and leave on 15-20 minutes. I left it on for 20 and rubbed it off with lukewarm water and my fingers at first, then dampened a wash cloth to get the rest off. It smells very fresh like you just came squeaky clean out of the shower but it isn't over whelming. I have combination skin but because it's winter my skin is as dry as sand, after I use this mask it is so smooth and soft it's amazing. I have acne also that can get really red and irritated but the mask minimizes the redness and relaxes my pimples. I follow up with a light moisturizer face lotion and then a moisturizing h2o spray and it's great.I love this product it's like magic in a container, defiantly a buy again or a gift for a friend. OK I just use this for the first time on the back of my thighs for about 20 minutes. Relaxed and read the paper while lying on my stomach. I rinsed off in the shower and actually never thought to look at the results because I figured I wouldn't see much of anything or it would take a number of treatments before I would. Several hours later I looked in the mirror and I was pretty shocked to see how much this had improved my cellulite! Keep in mind that mine is quite mild so it may respond better. If you've got severe cellulite and are we out of shape it may not work so well for you. I exercise regularly and have 21% body fat which is fairly lean for someone who's not a big-time athlete. This stuff is great! It comes with soooo much for the price. I used to go every week and get a $2 mask from the drug store and treat myself, but it adds up! This container really has a lot and it doesn't require much per use. It burns the heck out of my face (I have sensitive, dry skin) but it hurts so good! I suggest doing this mask after a hot shower. I also like to do it in the tub. It's awesome. Highly recommend. I've used it twice and the first time it burned like hell so I took it off. Then I realized it was because I used another product right before. And so I tried it out again with just washing my face simply with water and it had a light sting for like 30 seconds than it was chilly and relaxing while it dried. I forgot I had it on 25 minutes later and I took it off, my face was soft and my skin IS clearing up! Now they are just dark spots. I'm going to do an application today to see if they get rid of them! So my advice is just wash your face with water before and do moisturizer after! Then you're good to go! I use it every 4 days. Good luck! I really enjoyed using this mud mask. One jar lasted me about four months, and I used it for face and body. I loved the smelll, how it made my skin feel, and the value. I would recommend trying it out. I love this product! I have never used a mud mask before and I gotta say I'm impressed. This stuff has last me for about 2 months now and I usually try to use this mask at least once a week! I do believe this has helped with my pores and acne. Box came damaged but Amazon took care of me...yeaaa.  I was able to salvage some product (scraped off plastic bag it came in) because I was wanting to use it.  I'm glad I did.  Within a couple of hours using it, the junk was coming out of my face!  No joke.  This is from many years of using foundation and not having a mask like this.This stuff is amazing.  Next day everyone commented on how my skin looked so good.I recommended to everyone. Love love love this mask!!! Over the years I have STRUGGLED with large pores on my nose and on my cheeks. After using this product for about two weeks (applying the mask three times a week) I have noticed that my face is SO smooth, my pores have shrunk incredibly, and I feel so radiant and beautiful! my boyfriend has especially noticed, loves the results, and has begun using this mask on his face!! (Oops that was suppose to be a secret haha) anyway overall AMAZING.i have recommended this to almost everyone I know!! :) This mask moisturizes, cleans pores, helps manage oil production and gives you a phenomenal glow.  My husband and I swear by this mask to improve skin.I use this mask twice weekly in addition to a Charcoal/Dead Sea bar soap and Mizon ""All in One Snail Repair Serum""--these three products have given me a softer, clearer skin than I've ever had in my life.  I highly recommend this product! Every since I started using this mask my pimples on myspace have reduced tremendously I will purchase this again cuz I think it is helping my breakouts most definitely and I have been using it for two and a half weeks I love it It's definitely something I would go and buy all over again Love EVERYTHING about this! The smell, the texture, the feeling it leaves after washing off! Not to mention youll have ZERO black heads after! Just dont forget to moisturize after cause it WILL dry your face out! We started using this mask just a few nights ago and absolutely love it! Our skin feels fresh and fantastic after using it just a few times - we can't wait to see the improvements after we continue to use it more! It took me a bit to find time to try this but when i did... I was so pleasantly surprised! And as you can see... my boyfriend tried it with me! lol we both did as instructed and washed and dried our faces before we put on the mask. The mask went on VERY smooth and has a surprisingly WONDERFUL aroma to it! We both thought it was going to smell like...well, mud! lol but it had a very nice scent and was very quick and easy to put on. two things I really liked, it didn't start drying right away and caking up like other ones I've used and also didn't start to squish my face and hurt and start to crumble off as it dried like other ones I've used. It was easy to get off with warm water and even as i was washing it off it felt like washing off lotion it left my skin so soft! I applied a little moisturizer afterwords and i felt so refreshed! So very glad I tried this and that I have a huge jar left to do it often! Ps. my boyfriend liked it too but declined an interview lolSTATEMENT: To those who don't trust reviews from people who get free or discounted products for being HONEST and UNBIASED, like me.... YOU CAN TOO! There is nothing wrong with getting a deal on something for being completely honest and for the company using your feedback to evolve and improve their product. It costs NOTHING to sign up for these websites and you are NOT obligated or coaxed into leaving a certain amount of stars or a positive comment unless you actually like the product! In fact, if the company tries to bribe you to leave positive feedback, you can report them! So, don't knock it before you try it! Thanks for reading and I really hope my review helped you! So much easier to use than Aztec clay - would say works about as well although much less intense. Bought to shrink my pores and it does this very well. Had no luck with other toners, even those highly rated. This smells nice and leaves my face soft. Most masks will end up causing me acne, but not this one. It has helped clear up acne spots. I will also get a small dot of psoriasis on my face which have also gone away. If you have problem skin, give this a try. I'm glad I did! OMG!! I planned on using for a few weeks then reviewing but here I am minutes after using this product! I even text my husband pictures and he is amazed as well. Came in nice package, sealed and boxed. Doesn't smell unpleasant at all. I did a skin test and all was well so I went ahead and used it. I recently got staph on my cheek, I knew what it was and it was caught early so no major damage. However I have a very noticeable dark area (several actually). I've had issues with my skin every since this happened. I've purchased a tea tree face wash and moisturizer but haven't gotten them yet. I bought this after reading reviews and I'm so glad I did! I cleansed my face with Acure face wash as your face should be clean before applying this. I then applied the mask and let it dry for 20 minutes. I planned on taking it off at 15 if it felt uncomfortable but it didn't. Once I removed it I was shocked!! Results speak for themselves you be the judge! I will say you NEED a moisturizer after using this. It does dry your skin a bit. However I feel that is to be expected considering all it does. If you are on the fence about purchasing this, don't be. Buy it. Buy it right now. I am now planning on trying other Art Naturals products. My son has been struggling with moderate to severe acne.  We've been trying many products and this is a must-have.  It's made more of a difference than salycic acid pads and benzoyl peroxide creams.  Really noticeable results.  We will stick with this product (using on a weekly basis) with the expectation that his acne and scars will eventually clear up completely. Easy to apply and easy to remove. My skin felt so smoothe and clean! I've been plagued by an oily, grimy, blackhead/pimple ridden face since my early teens.  Many years later, I finally decided to do something about it.  I'm also on a budget, so prescription brands are out of the question.  I've tried various methods.  strips, apricot scrub, peel masks, and while the peel masks yielded the best results, the light at the end of the tunnel came in a dead sea mud mask.  this one in particular.  This is by far the least abrasive, easiest to use, best feeling, and most effective method I've used.  It's easy to apply, feels great on the skin, simple to remove/clean up.  My skin has felt wonderful as a result!  And it will not break your budget.  You can get a lot of use out of the one jar.  And it is worth it!  as long as I remember to apply it on a consistent basis, it yields great results!! I love this stuff I so far went threw a whole bottle of this, so I decided to purchase another one and I did. Before I purchased another one, I read the negative reviews on this product and some people were saying that the bottle was plastic and thin and cheap, but the one I had was by the same seller. And for some reason my second I bought, that one has the plastic and not the harder one I had previously. So keep in mind: This does work and it's perfect but the bottle will look different and u might get one with a harder bottle or u might get one with the thinner bottle. They both work the same and are the best thing I have ever purchased. This stuff is amazing!! The smell is just incredibly, like a super clean smell.  Makes my skin uber soft, and squeaky clean.  I feel as if im at the spa for the 20 min I leave it on.  Ill def be reordering with seller soon! This is a really nice product upon receipt I cleansed my face and applied the mud mask and allowed it to sit for at least 20 minutes and then I rinsed it off. I would recommend using a wet sponge or towel to thoroughly rinse mask from face. It can be very messy if not properly rinsed.I noticed after rinsing my face that the mask had my face feeling really nice and tight and refreshed. I applied a moisturizing to my face as well which will add to the nice feeling. A great detox therapy face mask which you feel immediately. It gives you that Art Natural feeling right away!The mud itself is thick to touch, it's not a sandy feeling at all. It applies on smooth and thick, as it dries you can feel the tightening, however, it doesn't crack up like most masks that I've used. This is a keeper!It comes in a really nice jar which is not heavy feeling at all. It doesn't stain anything due to the dark color. which is also a great feature. This mud mask is so amazing.  I have issues with an oily 'T"" zone oily face and it drives me nuts.  I tried this mud mask today and it states to apply it thick and with dry hands so no cross contamination.  It went on smooth and felt so wonderful.  I have tried a lot of different facial masks and this one is by far the best mask I have ever tried.  It didn't get tight on your face but you could tell it was working.  Certain parts dried on your face as you are only to leave on your face for 5 to 10 min.  I left on for 10.  Then I took a shower and rinsed it off.  Man my face felt tingly fresh and squeaky clean.  I would say you should splurge on this product because if makes you feel like you have been to the spa and you saved gas and time by staying home.  Better yet have a girls day buy a jar pass it around, have some wine and good conversation while you pamper yourself.  It's a great way to pamper yourself and give you that lift we all need to get us through the week.I purchased this product at a reduced price for my unbiased opinion.  I have personally used this product. 4:180:00This video is not intended for all audiences.

Please watch my video review of this product.  I love both of these masks.  You can feel this mask really tightening more than other masks I have used but they have mostly been clay or at least more clay. It's like your skin is being tugged toward the center of your face. So you know it's doing something, because you can feel it doing something . You will not look beautiful wearing this mask. I would say I HOPE I am unrecognizable with this on. The mask is slimy and easy to apply unlike clay masks I have used in the past and like I said the mud really tightens and draws much better. I love everything I have ever purchased from Art Naturals and highly recommend their Organic products. A little of this goes a long way and I think that the amount I used was pretty much right. \. I put a pretty thick coat on its just kind of translucent when you apply it. It dries a beautiful natural color and when it's dry and on your face, you look like you have zero wrinkles and no clue where they went and are hoping you stay that way when it comes off.... When I took the mask off what surprised me was how easily it was removed. It wipes right off with a warm washcloth. My face felt really clean-too clean-and slightly red. So I knew I needed to take a moment to my face with my favorite oils and they soaked right in... Bad oil out, good oil in... All better. I experienced a little temporary redness.  This mask has a mild exfoliating or peeling effect and detoxifies. My skin is sensitive so it turned it a little red for a few minutes.  Had I not replenished the oil in my skin with rosehip oil or argan or jojoba or whatever you have handy, it would still be red and dry tomorrow I would have hated life and blamed this product and given it a one star review. This really should probably be on the instructions to replenish oil afterwards. I think it would help inexperienced users to give better reviews. I really love this mask but I understand why some have had bad experiences. This mask should not be used every day like some are doing but probably twice a week. The instructions should be clearer. That's what I don't like about this product as well as the other one I tried-the salt and minerals are going to dry out your face, so don't not use because of slight redness, but if it is horrible redness, apply the oil to the test area. Everything else I love. It's good for me because it is getting rid of scars and wrinkles and shrinking pores. I will update this again in a week or two. After using this mask, the oil I used was 100%rosehip oil, I massaged then wiped off with a warm cloth and applied my regular skincare. The skincare burned a little due to exfoliation. Burning can be a great thing if handled properly-think mild chemical peel. My skin feels much more moisturized after doing this and looks more moisturized. You can't use this mask and wash it off with soap like some of the one star reviews and expect good results. The mask is just a step in the process to having the glowing effects this mask will HELP give you but it is not a stand alone miracle. You can only do magic by learning the tricks.  Watch the video and I think it will be helpful.  I am pale with eczema and sensitive skin.  This is my 2nd dead sea mud mask this week and 2nd was less irritating because my skin is expecting it now, I glow afterward and all the dull skin is gone.  I will always use my good oil afterward!  I'm 43 so you can see what this mask can do when you watch the video.  Amazing stuff! I just tried this. I am honestly amazed at how soft my face feels (well, the non-​fuzzy places anyway) and even my goatee is noticeably softer! I haven't been this impressed by a facial product since those pore strips were invented.The directions say to apply to a clean, dry face with a thick layer. After you let it dry, you wash it off by rubbing in circular motions with your fingertips. I put it on, took a selfie or two, and then checked my email. By the time I was done (20 minutes or so) the mud was nice and dry. I made an attempt at washing it off at the sink and quickly decided finishing in the shower was going to be easier. This is going to be added to my regularly scheduled Sunday night pampering routine. I don't care if I'm supposed to be a manly man, I feel special!DISCLOSUREThe Maker has provided me with this product discounted or free of charge for review and feedback based on my first-hand usage of the product. This deep sea mud mask is made of the best ingredients and is all natural. The expiration pn the current product is March, 2019. The smell of the mud mask is almost neutral, but does smell of natural mud clay. It doesn't smell bad nor intriguing. I let the mask sit on my face and neck for a little over a half hour altogether. Afterwards my face and neck looked less porous tighter. On top of that my skin was more even toned and soft to the touch. My skin stayed moisturized for over two days afterwards. The texture of the mask is smooth and not gritty at all. It was a pleasure to apply and easy to wash off. I even accidentally landed some on my white blouse, which cleaned up quite easily as well. Overall five stars. I would recommend this product to anyone with moisture issues and acne or uneven skin tone. Thanks, Art Naturals!This product was supplied to me at no cost in order to evaluate and share my experience. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest & unbiased opinion. One may or may not have the same results as myself when using it. I bought this item about 2 years ago for my kid's eczema. It didn't work; however, it did speed up the healing of my kid's CONTAGIOSUM MOLLUSCUM. She started having this rash in the beginning of May. The pediatrician diagnosed her with different type of eczema and prescribed her with triamcinolone. My very own Fluocinonide,  triamcinolone and other over the counter steroids were very ineffective after weeks of treatment. I did my google research and diagnosed her with Molluscum. I stopped all steroids and began treating her with daily oatmeal and epsom salt baths, and application of  (2x/day) algenist retinol and peter roth thomas sulfur 10% mask. A week after using this new treatment plan, there's some relief. I decided to add art naturals dead sea mud mask to the sulfur mask, and the rash dried up less than a week later. We are so happy with the results. It dried up the rash but not her skin. By the way, we left the sulfur, retinol and dead sea mask on her rash overnight. Just received this gem! I showered with hot water like usual, washed my face with Dove soap and then patted dry. Then I applied this mask all over my face for twenty minutes and rinsed off with warm water and OMG!! I noticed right away that my extremely stubborn blackheads on my nose were almost all gone! My pores were so much smaller and my skin brighter and softer! Whoa!! This stuff is awesome!!!! I really like it. It feels good when it's on and great when you wash it off. It really left my skin feeling super soft and remarkably clean. I've used it after I exfoliated which felt fantastic. But what really feels good if after I get out of the pool. My face is usually slightly sunburnt and super dry from the chlorine. It's so soothing. The other day I, quite foolishly, tried to remove my pealing sunburnt skin with a coffee exfoliant. Really bad idea. Don't ever try exfoliating pealing skin. It was very painful. So I put some of the mud mask on that area, (my shoulders). That was also quite soothing. It calmed the burning sensation. I would normally use aloe, but this worked better partially due to its viscosity. I honestly wish I could lay in a tub full of that mud. That's how good it feels. Definitely spa quality stuff. I selected this product because I've always heard so many good things about Dead Sea mud and salts and received a discount for reviewing it. It definitely did not disappoint! I've read some of the negative reviews and I honestly don't know how anyone could say anything bad about this stuff. Unless you're super allergic to some ingredient, this stuff is great! This is absolutely the best face mask ever. It is plenty full of minerals that are great for your skin and it leaves you feeling refreshed and hydrated. As a mom who is working part time and going to school full time, it is nice to spend a good 15 minutes on myself every now and then. Honestly I didnt put much stock into this product. And after my first try the mask burned like burned burned.... i rinsed it at about 5 minutes. The second time i tried it the experience was way better i left itfor 10 minutes with zero burning. And now i use it once a week its a staple now. My face is so flippin soft and happy :) This mask has completely salvaged my skin. I struggle with breakouts and redness/scarring and nothing ever seems to clear it up perfectly. Using this every day for a week, my pores have shrunk, scarring has cleared up, and my skin has gotten much less oily throughout my long work day. I have been using a lot less makeup and been much happier about the quality of my skin. I try to put this on an hour before showering or overnight before bed. Amazing results. I am surprised by how much I love this mask! I received a discount to purchase this product, but when it runs out I will definitely pay full price for more - but I don't know when I will ever run out! I've coated my whole face twice, and both times I just used the plastic cover underneath the lid: it touches the mud, and the tiny amount that gets on the plastic is PLENTY to cover my whole face.This mask smells fine, which is perfect for me. I don't want it to smell ""nice"", that means perfumed and that makes me sick. It doesn't smell chemically, it doesn't smell like sulfur, it doesn't really smell like much at all. It dries quickly but does not get uncomfortably tight like so many masks I've tried, so I wasn't in a rush to get it off my face. It washed off easily without having to scrub my face, and it moisturized my skin as well. Usually when I use masks or even any acne face washes (should the acne be gone a 30 years old?) if I don't lather on the moisturizer afterward my skin is tight and painful. I didn't have to moisturize after this, and the next day my skin still feels great.It's not a miracle product, I didn't wake up with brand new skin looking like a supermodel. But it's a great product and I like using it, which means I'll stick with it. No burning, soft skin, and hopefully clearer skin with continued use - that's 5 stars in my book! Amazing!!! Started having acne really bad after having my daughter.... Seriously face of a teenage boy (I'm 30)!! Tried EVERYTHING!! Nothing worked. I have been using this every other day for less than 2 weeks and my face has had 0 breakouts and its starting to clear the scars!! Must Buy!! Great price and arrived I am pretty sure the Very next day after ordering. Ill be purchasing more in the near future!! The Dead Sea is an amazing place. It’s a tiny body of water nestled between Israel and Jordan. Despite its size, it’s unique because it’s the lowest place on Earth, and it’s so salty that you’ll float without even trying. The landscape of the sea causes numerous minerals and substances to be deposited into the sea. It eventually washes ashore to the sea’s bank providing a rich mud that is filled with natural goodness.These fascinating features have given the sea an aura that is attractive to many people. Tourists come from far and wide to get a chance to soak in these healing waters and slather the mud on their skin.Many companies extract the mud from the sea and package it into a convenient product. While the mud is great to lather on your body, it’s most convenient to use as a mask.  This product is the best of the bunch.  Price and quality is better than any other product on the market!!!!There are a ton of reasons why you must get your hands on Dead Sea mud. Here are a few of the top reasons:Benefits of Dead Sea MudDead Sea mud is rich in a variety of minerals, salts and other powerful substances. These include magnesium, potassium, sodium and calcium. This powerful blend of nutrients does wonders for the skin including:• Improves Complexion: The powerful nutrients in the Dead Sea mask help to shrink pores, reduce the appearance of lines and wrinkles, and help to draw out the toxins from your pores. It also helps to clear dead skin cells, leaving your skin clearer and brighter.• Reduces the Appearance of Cellulite: It provides good blood circulation and relaxes the skin.Remedy’s Skin Conditions: These conditions include psoriasis, eczema and acne.• Moisturizes Skin: It can help promote a healthy balance of oil production.• Prevents Aging: This mud has the power to tighten and firm sagging skin by promoting strong elasticity.• Gets Rid of Impurities: The masks work to unclog pores and to help purge your skin of any residues leaving you with fresher, younger looking skin.Those are some pretty powerful benefits!In fact, the healing power of the Dead Sea is so profound that many people travel there to treat a variety of health ailments including arthritis and allergies. But for now we are just focusing on the amazing benefits for skin, specifically through facial masks. Not to thick or thin, this mud mask has a pleasant smell that is light and fresh and does not really stay on your skin after you wash it off, I love the natural, easy on my skin ingredients! Really seems to help prevent acne and minimize my pores which is awesome but I would honestly use it even if it did not because it has such a relaxing, luxurious spa feel that you just feel better and more rejuvinated just using it! Plus it has that perfect texture that you only seem to be able to get from a spa that just feels smooth and soft and not clumpy at all.I love the ingredients, obviously dead sea mud but also sunflower oil, jojoba oil and shea butter which I just love in any skin care product because they are so effective and natural so not so harsh on my skin as many other effective treatments might be.Some down sides for me are kind of true of all mud masks: takes a long time to dry, like fifteen to thirty minutes depending on how thick I put it on.really can only put on before a shower in my opinion because washing it all off well is just hard any other way.Some things I love though are: cruelty free, do not need ot use it every single day because none of us have time for that, also there is a TON in the jar and it is so thick and creamy that, especialy if you only use 1-3 times a week you should be able to use one jar for a long time because there is so much of it and you do not need a lot at one time. This is a great mud mask that does exactly what it is supposed to do!  Pulls all that stubborn sebum out of my pores and is a gentle exfoliator.  Just make sure to replenish the skin after wards! I love that the ingredients are natural. This was easy to apply and wash off. It left my skin feeling very soft and feeling clean and purged. I did not experience any discomfort and though I have sensitive skin there were no reactions. I have purchased and used many art naturals products and have enjoyed all of them!If you found my review helpful please vote ""YES"" as this helps me become a better reviewer!I received this product at a significant discount for my honest review and they are my own opinions and of my own accord. I received no monetary gain for this review and I am not required to give a positive review. I do not know the seller or am associated with the seller in any way. When I rate something the number of stars is just my opinion on how I feel about the product. If I give something a 5 star rating that means that I truly love that product and use it often it and I truly am glad I have it. Items I give 4 star ratings are items that do exactly as I would expect, but have not stood out significantly in any way or that have some minor flaw but the product is worth it to overlook the flaw. An item that gets a 3 star rating from me is one that I feel neutral regarding the product. Rarely will I give a 1 or 2 star rating unless the item is completely worthless and not worth the money. If I have received the item at a discount, then I go through the same exact reviewing process as if I paid full price for the product. since I have dry skin except T zone I applied Art naturals Dead Sea mud to my T zone only. I left the product on my face for about 15 minutes and rinse it off. My experience was a slight tightening feeling as it dried which I expected. A tiny bit of the tingly feeling. And a slight pinkness of my face after rinsing in the area that the mud mask was applied. I followed up with my normal moisturizer and make up.I initially like the product mostly because of how smooth it goes on. it's not thick or chunky like some I have tried in the past. it dries evenly without a unpleasant cracking feeling.I wanted to initially try this because as I'm aging my pores are getting larger at 54 years old I am trying to pamper my skin and keep it looking younger.. I never have had much of a problem with acne but I am trying this product to clean my pores and reduce them in size. I did not notice anyunpleasant fragrance, remember to keep it away from your eyes when placing this product on your face.disclaimer I received this product at a free or reduced price for honest testing on myself and my honest review of the product. please feel free to leave any positive or negative comments."
B00W22NXSA," Excellent I was introduced to Eminence products at a spa this summer, and was excited to find the line on Amazon. I LOVE each and every one I try. This is a lovely spa-like product that feels great on the face. Had a facial in Chandler, Arizona about 2 months ago, and this product was recommended.  I love it!!! I love how it cleans my face, smells good, and the texture of it and how it leaves my skin nice and soft. Best exfoliation I've tried. Thanks. This is the best exfoliating product I have ever use.. what a difference in my skin.. its gentle but it works.. Great product, excellent service Really works very happy It is hard to beat Eminence products.  This is a great cleanser and mild exfoliant.  I have used various Eminence products for years and love them.  They are pricey but effective. New product for me me, but I like it so far. Eminence has the best skin care products! And, very pleased with this facial cleanser. Fast delivery for my order from this seller. Thank you! I have sensitive skin and this product does not bother me one bit!  This cleanser was first used on me during a spa facial, and it was so gentle that I purchased the starter pack.  I've since used up the starter pack and purchased the Monoi Age Corrective Exfoliating Cleanser and the Organics Coconut Age Corrective Moisturizer.  My skin feels clean and well nourished and never dry. Love this Eminence product.  The exfoliating qualities are effective, yet small enough to not be too gritty.  Fast shipping..will buy again!

This is a very good skin product. My new favorite cleanser. It exfoliate but doesn't leave your skin dry. I use it on daily basis Lovely! My skin loves this product!

It appears to be authentic, only concern is that it smells like my old bottle. You don't want to sit on Eminence products they're natural and have a shelf life. The color looks fresh. Saved about $8.00 vs spa price.I haven't purchased this from Amazon yet, my daughter that works at a spa carries it. I'm 58 have very dry sensitive skin. I use this daily. Love it! I like the eminence products. This cleanser works very well and leaves a very clean feeling. Love this. Ran out and switched to another brand and hated it.

Great everyday moisturizing cleanser Has a nice exfoliating texture and it's from Eminence ~ nothing more to say but YEAH!! BEST EXFOLIATOR EVER! This product provides the deep cleaning I need.  I enjoyed the starter kit, but have not replaced the other items as of yet.  Still debating on that issue.  Will buy this product again. Excellent product! This makes your skin feel so soft.

Excellent Smells great and works well in combination with my other anti-aging product. Love it!!!! great Very gentle exfoliating cleanser.  Works well. Excellent product with immediate results! great product Emimence Products are great... and this is no exception.  My skin feels so smooth afterwards and it hasn't broken me out or dried me out either.  Really happy w/this purchase and it will last a long time (how I justify the cost because it's pricey).  I have seen an improvement in texture and will definitely repurchase. I absolutely love this face wash! I've been prone to getting breakouts along my chin and nose monthly and I have yet to have one since I started using this product two months ago. My skin seems a lot brighter and any roughness that I had before has gone away. I do sometimes dilute this with water because I use it daily, but even when I don't the product doesn't irritate my skin. I love how clear my skin is! This product delivers!  It smells clean and fresh, and gently exfoliates, leaving even my 70-year-old skin with a healthy, youthfu glow.  It's made with very finely ground olive seeds that remove dirt, makeup and old skin cells very gently but thoroughly. My esthetician uses this and I asked her what it was after my facial because it felt truly wonderful.  She told me that she is using the complete line of these products  on herself and I have to admit, her complexion looked great.  I have been getting some pesky hairs growing in my chin area that seem more like mini whiskers. After tweezing them, they are becoming ingrown and I have created a mess.  Using this exfoliating cleanser twice per day, the bumps are disappearing after scrubbing my chin and releasing those pesky ingrown hairs!  I am still tweezing them, but  I no longer have to dig down to reach them. My skin is back to being smooth.  It is also a very mild cleanser which seems to hydrate my skin. I use very little water to dilute it –  because I want the scrub power on my chin. Oh boy this is really great at cleansing aging skin. Leaves it so smooth and soft. The first cleaner that I actually like. Removes all traces of makeup. I love this product.  Muach better than myi old cleanser.  A very good organic cleanser. I absolutely love this cleanser.  My skin is so soft and it seems to be more even toned.  I will definitely continue to use Eminence. This is my new favorite facial cleanser.  It lightly exfoliates without irritating my sensitive skin.  It also moisturizes and makes my face feel awesome. Works great. I use it with a recharable facial brush. This is my favorite Eminence cleanser because of the exfoliating and cleansing together. I will buy this for years to come The ingredients in this product are really clean. It's great for a mature face. Use it morning and night to keep your face clean. Love this! Item arrived intact, however I did not personally use it. Love this brand. This cleanser doesn't disappoint. I've been using this for about 8 months -- so it lasts a long time! It has a little texture to provide exfoliation. I have to say, my skin has never looked better. I use this in combination with the Strawberry Rhubarb Dermafoliant, followed by the Bamboo Firming Fluid and Eminence moisturizer. At my last facial, the esthetician raved about my skin tone and my pores, even before she asked about my routine. So, I can say that even a skin pro thinks it's working! I love this exfoliating cleanser from Eminence.  I went to a local spa and they used this product line. Washes away any  impurities, removes debris gives you smooth skin.  The combination of gentle fruit AHAs, botanical enzymes and finely ground olive seeds refine and purify the skin's texture for a more radiant and younger looking complexion.  Leaves my face soft.  Just need a little bit.  Apply to damp skin, and massage gently with fingertips then rinse throughly. For a lighter application dilute with a few drops of water before application. I'm just starting to take care of my skin -- mid-30s and a little on the dry side.  The fragrance is herbal and clean, and a little goes a long way. The ground olive seed is the perfect exfoliant, as it's not harsh and gritty. Loving the Neroli eye serum, the Arctic Berry peel system, and the Coconut age corrective moisturizer.  Fragrances and textures of the products are out of this world. First time the product arrived with a broken pump, but it was quickly replaced.  My skin has dramatically improved -- it's a skincare regimen I look forward to! I've tried a few other Eminence products and face washes specifically.  Great great products. This face wash is by far the BEST one that I hve every used. I have normal ish skin and it's the perfect balance for me.  It's great also because you can use it everyday, morning and night. It washes away all dirt, makeup and impurities.  Amazing, organic, natural face wash !  Will purchase again ! Excellent product. This is my second bottle and definitely my favorite exfoliating cleanser. It leaves my skin looking radiant, and free of dead skin. I use it twice a week, and I always look forward to use it. It smells nice. I would highly recommend this product to others. With regards to shipment it came as expected, and it was nicely and safely packed. Love the way my skin feels after use.  I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate at all. Also use the Bamboo firming cream afterwards.  Love Eminence products! One of my favorite Eminence products! It’s a great exfoliant, and gentle enough to use twice a day. I have dry skin, and it has calmed my occasional breakouts. It removes my makeup pretty well, too. I use it with the coconut moisturizer and the neroli oil eye cream. I LOVE this stuff! Wish I'd found it sooner. It's perfect for aging/combination skin. Usually I don't like a creamy face soap that doesn't foam up, but this one works for me somehow. My skin feels clean, fresh, and soft. It's wonderful! This exfoliating scrub is one of the best in the market. Super gentle on your skin, so you can use it daily, yet very effective. Have been using this for more than 6 months and my skin is definitely smoother and clearer. I love that all the ingredients are natural and organic. Plus, it smells delicious! This brand is a total treat for your skin. SO nice!  Cleans well, smells good, you use very little, and it's not horribly abrasive as so many other products.  Leaves skin feeling so clean yet not tight or dry. This brand is amazing. I discovered them in Los Angeles, and have been using various products, one is better than the next. This particular facial cleanser has the perfect- the lightest exfoliant, it is super light and I love the smell. All organic and hi end European skin care. GREAT LINE! Excellent quality product that has worked wonders for my skin! I am in my late 30s and I kid you not, I am consistently pegged for mid-20s. Yes, I do other things to take care of my skin as well, but there was a noticeable reduction in fine lines after using this product for only a few weeks.  I actually canceled my last Botox appointment because I no longer needed it after using this! And the great bonus with this cleanser is that it doesn't make my skin breakout.  It's the only anti-aging formula that I've found about which I can make that claim. Perfect cleanser for exfoliation. I would not use it more than once a day since it tends to be a little too effective,l and over work your skin This really exfoliates off flaky skin. It moisturizes beyond belief. I’ve had dry skin issues since birth and this is the only product that has ever worked for me! I’ve been using this product for years and I just love it! I LOVE this cleanser.  Normally, I do not like a cream cleanser but this one doesn't leave my face feel oily.  I use it with my clarisonic and my skin looks beautiful.  Does not remove eye makeup. I love this product line. this product makes my skin feel smooth and I enjoy the fragrance. It is better to use with your face damp but not wet. I love Eminence, this is no exception.  Exactly what I expected."

My skin never feels tight after cleansing. Removes makeup easily -especially waterproof mascara. Highly recommend. GENTLE, great cleaner for my older skin and my 20 something daughters skin- a little bit high on the price point, but I will buy again for my daughter. Best cleanser for rosacea.

It smells fresh and earthy while leaving my skin soft and clean. LOVE IT !!! Love it / a gentle cleanser which leaves my face feeling ""fresh""!  Just wish it didn't cost so much!  I use it twice each day so it doesn't last long. Much cheaper on amazon. Great product. I have a hard time finding soaps that work for my skin type. I had to buy very expensive soaps and was recommended to try this one. This one works great and is very affordable. I've been using it for over 6 months now. I have very sensitive skin and had a hard time finding a good cleanser that doesn't make me break out or dry out my skin. It has a very refreshing, light cucumber scent and my face feels nice and clean after using it. This cleanser is the only cleanser I will use! good probably my 100th fresh face wash! very moisturising Excellent product.  Gently cleanses while retaining moisture.  It is a bit expensive, but I feel the product is worth it. Great product, very soft on your delicate face skin! Will rebuy. Good Great Product! I have used this product for years. It's the only cleanser for me you need to try this cleanser, not like any other! skin feels soft and clean after every use, can be used with clarasonic, extra plus! Good one. Will buy again I love the feel of this cleanser, and it takes very little to wash my face, which is good since it's spendy for me. The skin soft and clean after use it, good for winter time Holy grail for makeup removing and cleansing. smells like cucumbers with a  light floral note that doesn't bother my sensitive nose. does a great job, is somewhat mild, but does a great job removing the grease and grime of the day. This stuff is the BEST. I feel like it both cleanses AND soothes my skin. My face actually feels hydrated when I rinse it off, but doesn't feel greasy. I wish I could EAT this stuff! Really lovely smell,  creamy but with fine  suds so you can see exactly where you are cleansing.  I use it with my Clarkson.  Face is soft and sparkling clean feeling after rinsing. this cleanser is very light weight and washes off all makeup very well. nice fragrance and not irritating to the skin. maybe a little pricey but worth the money. great skin cleanser product is awesome GREAT PRODUCT---WORKS  .. This is the best product I have ever used on my face!  It removes all makeup, gently cleanses and leaves your face feeling fabulous!!! great product with or without clairsonic brushes pretty good ，i still use it everyday ... a bit more expensive My skin feels great after each wash with this cleanser. Good. Love it!! I love this face wash. It smells great and doesn't dry out my skin. One of the best cleansers I've ever used in life. It is not very oily and an excellent choice for people who have oily skin. I've been using Fresh Soy Products for quite a while now and like them very much. Purchased for my daughter she is very happy with this product I first tried this product in sample size and I really liked it. It left my face feeling clean, fresh, and soft. Most products tend to dry or irritate my skin, but this one does the job perfectly. I truly recommend. good good I like this cleanser very much. Using it for 2-3 years. It is gentle, cleans good and I like its fresh smell. I used to buy it on sephora site,but figured that ordering from Amazon is a bit cheaper. beyond my imagination Thanks! good feeling and clean. nice Great, thanks! I have been using this cleanser for a couple years now and I really like it.  It has a fresh cucumber smell and is very gentle on my skin.  It is a little pricey, but I think it is worth it! I love this cleanser. I have very sensitive skin and this product does wonders for my skin. I have used for years and will use it for years to come. This is the best facewash and I have stuck with it for the last 2.5 years! I love that it removes makeup so well too! Been using this product for years.  Great. This is great for sensitive skin! It doesn't dry you out but gets all of your makeup off. I will be purchasing again. This was bought as gift and was well received! Love.... good Fast shipping and great product. My friend got me a sample as part of a Christmas basket.  I'm in my 40's and have the worst skin.  I'm always on retin gel or cream (I have mild Rosacea AND melasma).  I have been on everything from expensive perception cleansers, to Obagi Nu-Derm, to coconut oil to grocery store brands. This is the only, I repeat, THE ONLY cleanser, that has not over dried, over or under cleansed--EVER. It's like baby bear, just friggin right!!!  It smells like cucumbers and rose, not overwhelmingly so but enough to remind you of your grandma. But it actually works. I'm smitten. Having suffered this long with crappy skin, I'm happy now. I just hope it isn't short lived like every other experience. I'm off to buy the large (maybe medium) tube and commit. Will update.  Just scrubbed before the pic and peeled from retin A, I'm a little pink. But I'm clean!!  I'm clean darn it!! I love this cleanser! The scent is roses and just calms me instantly.  It takes off all makeup and feel wonderful on my skin.  I have combination skin and live in the West, so it's very dry here.  This is great if your skin is dry but it doesn't cause breakouts.  I also love the company.  Fresh is cruelty-free, so I feel good using their products. After I received a birthday sample of this product at sephora, I decided to buy the big bottle.  Although it is expensive, it is worth every penny!  This is the best way to remove makeup! I used to use coconut oil (which I love) but I would have to wash my face after -- with this product I skip a step and only have to wash my face!  No oiliness or residue! Not too squeaky clean or stripped of all oils! This is the perfect makeup remover and a little drop goes a long way!  Removes all my makeup gently and quickly!  I have sensitive acne prone skin, and this does not irritate my skin or cause me to break out at all!  Love it and would buy again! I've been looking for non-drying cleansers, and this one is fantastic.The consistency is gel-like, similar to mucus. When applied to damp skin, it spreads easily and rinses clean.I have been using a different skin care regimen for the last several weeks, and this new routine involves more washing. I have very dry eczema-prone skin, so I needed cleansers that wouldn't strip my oils. This is the perfect cleanser for my face. I only use a pea sized dab, and it easily cleans my face and neck. I look forward to the cucumber scent, and enjoy that it is low sudsing. I have been using this alongside the Fresh Youth Preserve Face Cream.  The first several days I would use it periodically while also using my current cleansers, & I wasn't the least bit impressed. Then I began to use it every day, am & pm, along w/ the Face Cream, and after about 1 week, I noticed results. My skin is brighter and healthier and my pores seem to be decreasing. However, my break out cycle hasn't changed.  Also, it's gentle and nondrying. I'll likely continue to use. I originally bought this as part of a gift set from Fresh, but I fell in love with the cleanser and just bought my second tube of it today. It looks like it won't last long, but the little tube lasts me probably 2-3 months. You don't need a lot for each wash, and it's super gentle, and even takes off mascara. I've been using this cleanser for years now.. can't go without it. Amazing how it cleans well during sweaty summer weather n doesn't strip moisture from the skin in harsh winter weather. In any case it leaves u looking bright! (just that I use slightly more quantity in summer than in winter again depending on how oily my skin feels at any instant)! I do have quite some converts in my family, leaving the ladies aside this surprisingly includes my dad n hubby who know nothing n care least about skincare n happen to borrow this face wash at some instance - the men's version being ""Cleans well n feels good"" ;) I absolutely love this facial cleanser and have been a loyal user for 5+ years. I live in the Midwest where winters are brutal and this cleanser keeps my skin hydrated while still washing away makeup and impurities. It is great not having taught cheeks after cleansing. I have almost no breakouts since using this gentle cleanser.What I am curious about from the buyer standpoint is:The actual price of this product is US$38.00 from Fresh’s website and Sephora. If you have access to internet (which I assume you do since you’re shopping here presently), but not a local Sephora, why would you buy from this seller who is asking way too much for the product?Maybe it’s the “Prime” that sells you? I love this product. I use retin-A on my skin and this cleanser is gentle enough to be combined with it. It is on the pricey side, but the larger bottle lasts me about 6 months for 1-2 washes/day. They also use better quality ingredients that do not dry out my skin or make me break out. I definitely recommend sampling this product to see if it is for you. After trying dozens of face cleansers, my wife has finally come across this one. It doesn't irritate her skin at all so finding this after trying many 'extra gentle' (that weren't quite so gentle on her) is a blessing.  Thanks to birchbox for featuring this product, we're now lifetime customers! I wish I could give this more stars. I was really struggling with adult acne so much so that I went to a dermatologist, no luck. I tried to go back on birth control, eh. Then I went to sephora and caved to getting this with my rewards points and it's changed it all for me. I can't recommend this more. My skin hasn't looked this good in a long time. I can actually SEE the makeup coming off my face and don't have to ooze a bunch of the product in my hand to get a good cleaning. Such a great product that's so friggin worth the $$! I've been looking for this product for far too long... I use this with my Clairsonic cleaning brush thingy and then put coconut oil on my rinsed but still wet face and then dry with a paper towel. You're welcome. If you have skin problems, this stuff is totally worth it as it was seriously a dream come true for me (didn't irritate my severe acne like other products; took my skin from oily-type to normal-type as it doesn't strip oils; soothing on my very sensitive skin)! If you don't have skin problems and you're just looking for a nice cleanser, I would say it's not worth spending the money on this when other products will work just as well for you. Speaking of price, it's only $38 at Sephora, so get in-store or off of the Sephora website instead of here.As for the paraben complaint I've seen, the amount of parabens in this product are completely harmless and are needed to keep the natural ingredients from going bad. All skin and makeup products use either parabens or other synthetic preservatives, or they'd become cesspools for bacteria. I've used this cleanser for 3 years and it's only done me good. I absolutely love this product. I would go so far as to say it is my favorite cleanser. Your skins feels clean and refreshed after using, but not tight or dry. I've used this with both my Clarisonic and simply just hands. Would strongly recommend to anyone wanting to try out a new face wash. I received a birthday gift of this from Sephora and it is SO NICE! While it is fairly expensive it is totally worth the price, this is probably my favorite cleanser ever because it is gentle on my problem acne but works really well and doesnt dry out my face I was very pleased with this product as both an effective makeup remover (even for my waterproof mascara) and a soothing spread for the rest of the face.  I received a sample size when buying another product at an apothecary store and I am trying to milk every drop out of it to make it last!  Unfortunately, the price is a little steep, but I am reassured to hear that it lasts for a while.  It is true that a little goes a long way. I love this stuff it does such a good job cleaning my combination acne prone skin .  My skin is also very sensitive .  I'm so glad I stop using the harsh acne products when all I needed was natural stuff . I love this cleanser. My face feels smooth and bright and gives a clear complexion in just a few tries. I would recommend this for anyone with sensitive dry skin. I bought this from sephora after it was recommended to me by the sales associate. I am currently on accutane so my skin is very dry and flaky and still has some acne and this product is working wonders. My skin is soft and if I combine it with the sugar scrub I am flake free! The tone of my skin is also improving along with acne improvement. I definitely recommend this product! Excellent face wash that is gentle but clears up break-outs!This is cheaper on Sephora.com! i've never used a face wash that has gotten my skin so clean. it doesn't leave a greasy feeling on your face. its just...clean! its a miracle worker for removing makeup as well. i use a pretty thick concealer, and it just comes right off with this stuff. be careful not to use too much though, like they said a little goes a long way. it doesn't take a lot of scrubing or working in to get your face clean either. im one of those people that hate washing my face, but with this its so fast and relaxing i don't mind at all. buy this product, the price is a little much, but i guarantee you'll love it. If you're looking for a gentle cleanser, this one is amazing.  It lathers beautifully and feels silky on the skin.  My skin is generally dry, sensitive and acne prone and I liked that it didn't irritate it whatsoever.  When used with my Clarisonic Mia 2 Facial Sonic Cleansing System Limited Edition Bonus Gift Set, Pink it does a nice job of removing makeup and oil without over-drying the skin.  I swiped on my Fresh Rose Floral Toner 250ml/8.4oz afterward using a cotton round and didn't notice a trace of makeup.  liked that it was easy to rinse off and afterwards my skin didn't feel tight or dried out.  There was no residue left behind.  My skin also didn't look as red and flushed as it sometimes does after washing my face. Those who like a more perfumed facial cleanser may be disappointed at how this smells.  It has a slight almost herbal smell.  This seems to be a common experience for me with Fresh products.  I've tried a few and they don't tend to smell great, with the exception of the Floral Toner which smells a little too old lady for my taste, but I imagine would smell better to most people than other Fresh products.  For me the slight scent of this product this wasn't a big deal as I predominantly use unscented cleansers so I am used to something with little to no scent.  (And quite honestly when I use something with added fragrance it usually smells overpowering and noxious to me.)Overall, this is a really, really nice facial cleanser.  It's really well suited for sensitive and dry skin like mine.  My only question is why I didn't try it sooner. My friend gave a sample to me and I decided to buy myself a new one. I really love how it felt on my face. Love it, started with the 1.7 oz size and will purchase full size. My face is clean without being stripped of moisture.  Not sure where that list price comes from as Sephora sells it for full price and it is less than this. I absolutely LOVE and RAVE about this product ever since I used it in the store. She used it without water to wipe off my stubborn mascara, and after seconds, voila, it was gone. I went home lathered it, even though I dont think its meant to be lathered on with water, and it was just amazing.. I don't wear a lot of makeup but my what makeup I do wear, I would LIKE for it to come off easily, especially the eye makeup that leaves its residue and can have me wake up looking like a mad woman who punched herself in sleep.It leaves it hydrated, but I still prefer a moisturizer of course.It IS expensive, but seems like it will last me 2-3 months. This is by far the best skin product I have ever used. It helps clear up minor acne, it tones, it deep cleans without drying your skin out, it's not oily and it smells fresh- like cucumbers!I recommend this to everyone!! Great stuff! I have searched and searched for a mild clean smelling cleanser that does it all...this is it. Worth every penny, keeps skin clean and toned, also takes off eye makeup gently. I have used the same tube from August. Still have more to go. A little goes a long way. Buy it, you will love it too. If you're pressed for time and want 1 step instead of two, you should use this cleanser.  It literally eliminates all of your makeup - including mascara.  No more raccoon eyes.  :-)  It leaves your skin soft too - not tight and dry.  It's the only cleanser I buy.  I hope they never discontinue it! A gentle cleanser that doubles as a makeup remover.  When I am using heavier makeup, I would wash my face twice with this cleanser to make sure all traces of makeup is removed.  Otherwise, it works fine with light foundation.  Very 'fresh' scent."
B002RW9C3A," I only use when my skin is irritated. Best, absolute best, skin wash ever. Takes off all of my makeup in one washing, been using this for years. Love this face wash. A nice gentle cleanser. Recommend for people with sensitive skin. I have sensitive skin and this product does not bother my face. It actually appears to add some glow and vibrancy. Great product. I have very sensitive skin and this cleans really well and thoroughly without hurting my skin. You don't need a lot either, which is great. I have been using this for a few years now and love FAB... as well as their other products! I love FAB cleanser. It cleans my skin without drying it out. It removes oil, make up, dirt and leaves my face feeling very clean without leaving residue or making my face feel dry.  This is the second full size container I have bought and a little bit goes a long way so it lasts me many months. I highly recommend this product to people with sensitive skin...it does not seem to have any scent or perfume. I have used the Principal Secret line since it first came out but is now hard to get individual pieces and none in the original formulation. Sorry to have to let it go, but this cleanser does the job of removing make-up and leaving my skin feeling soft and hydrated. You don't need much, only a pea size amount, so it will last a long time. Satisfied with this product and will buy again. Fav face wash love that there's less chemicals and doesn't make my skin feel all right or leave this chemical smell or residue This face wash is very good and cleansing! I first heard about it through @missglamorazzi on Twitter & @TheGridMonster on YouTube. It makes your face feel so clean and fresh! I use it every morning and night! Still trying it out. But so far so good I LOVE this.  A pea size cleans my whole face (I use it with a facial buff and without).  Does not dry my skin at all, but does a great job removing makeup and gunk from the day.  Considering how little I use, this was last me a very long time. I love this product it works great foams nicely. removes makeup and dirt well.  doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. no fragrance. no bad smell. doesn't over dry. will buy this again. I've got dry, sensitive skin but I wear a bit of makeup (foundation, lots of mascara, brows) and needed something to cleanse and remove makeup without overly sensitizing my face. I don't often break out but acne products bother my skin. This product is it: my holy Grail of skincare. I've battled with acne for most of my life. I went on Accutane a few years ago, and it helped a little, but I still break out more than I should for someone who ""completed"" Accutane. My face tends to be dry with slight rosacea. This cleanser has been amazing. I use it with my Mia 2, and the combination has produced great results. The cleanser does not dry me out (Cetaphil was too harsh for my face) and has cleared up most of my acne. ""Breaking out"" for me now is one, maybe two pimples that disappear in a few days. I'm hopeful that with continued use my breakouts will be few and far between. I only wish I found this product sooner. Received a sample at Sephora and my very sensitive was so clean and I had to have a full tube. Works great. Doesnt dry out skin like other cleansers. Leave the skin feeling smooth and refreshed. I would recommend this product to anyone with oily skin or acne related issues. I have sensitive skin and this did not irritate it at all. My skin is slightly on the dry side and I love that this stuff does not dry it out further. A little goes a long way. One tube of this usually lasts me around 2-3 months. Great product that is extremely gentle on your skin and leaves it feeling clean and refreshed. Love it! Helps my rosacea and my skin is hardly ever mad at me anymore. It you have skin issues, I highly recommend this product! I never tried this brand before this item and I fell in love the with cleanser and the brand, so much so, that I ordered one for my daughter in college, my mother in Florida and my sister in NYC. All of us love this cleanser. Great product I really enjoy this face cleanser. It foams well and lathers nice on your face and neck. Rinses off easily and leaves your face feeling clean and not dry or tight. Works just as well as other products you might purchase at Sephora. I have combination/sensitive skin. I was introduced to this cleanser over the summer.  Its a simple creamy cleanser, its gentle on skin, it cleanses with out drying.  Really a nice product, they do not use added fragrance. Only facial cleanser I use for my sensitive skin. Leaves my face soft and moisturized. Use just a pea-sized amount on my Clarisonic brush head. Girlfriend recommended. It doesn't have any of those microbeads so it isn't rough on your skin nor does it contribute to polluting the environment. Good stuff. I used this until I could not squeeze out anymore product. I cut the end open to get the rest of the product out. I have oily skin but this product was just right. It did not dry me out nor did it leave a residue behind even though the consistency is creamy. The price is great. First time trying this product.  Works fine, and my face feels clean. great facial wash for dry sensitive face Background:I have oily T-zone and normal cheeks. Always had great skin then I got the Nexplanon (3 yr b.c stays in your arm). My face went crazy. Waited 6 months took it out waited another 6 months skin never got better. I spent all of 2011 & 2012 trying to get my face back I'be had two different dermatologist and between them everything was tried.More pimples and now dark spots I was loosing it.Now:I saw a review about this product and a girl said it worked in 5 days. I give you 2!! My face is already looks so much better!  I problem I kept having with other products is they would over dry and burn my face up. This feels so different.I'm soo happy i found it and I hope others do too. I have highly sensitive skin and most products will either make me break out, or trigger an eczema flare up. This does neither, and my skin feels and looks clean. Just a tiny bit of this cleanser does the job.  Not drying. Excellent Cleanser! I like this cleanser as it does a good job. Its gentle to the skin takes off all my make up. Reasonably price. Perfect for sensitive skin and acne sufferers (I am one). This is my current fave and go-to because it removes nearly all makeup. After I give my face a run of water under the shower first, I put some of the soap in my hands and clean my face. This method of washing has removed over 90% of my foundation, which is really all I ask for in a sulfate free/soap free cleanser, and this soap strikes all the tic marks. Great face wash.  I use it once a day.  Doesn't cause irritation and removes a full face of makeup. GREAT for sensitive skin. My go-to cleanser. cleared up my eczema better than anything my dermatologist prescribed. I use it int eh morning and at night and recommend it to all my friends. The only face soap I use. Incredibly mild and removes all eye makeup with a single wash. Amazing product. Really enjoy how creamy and soft this feels on my face during application. A dime size amount is more then enough to get a good lather. Face feels soft after rinsing. Good product for the money!! I love this face cleanser! In fact, I love all the First Aid Beauty products! I think they are VERY reasonable in price, compared to most other beauty brands.  Also, since the First Aid items are available on Amazon, I find very convenient. Thank you Amazon for simplifying my life. Many thanks!! My go-to morning and night cleanser.  Gets all the crap off my face without stripping it bare. I got this as a sample with some things I bought at sephora.  This product works great and feels great.  Easily washes away any make up and doesn't have any strong fragrances.  I am on my third tube of this now and I will continue to use it. What a wonderful face cleanser. Definitely worth the money, great for even removing heavy eye makeup LOvE this cleanser, perfectly foamy, a little goes a long way, and makes my skin squeaky clean! First Aid is the best. Great product, easy transaction. works so well with my sensitive skin and takes make off very well Completely takes of makeup, even water proof mascara!!! Even though it strips makeup off, it is moisturizing & a great price! I love this face wash. I have sensitive skin and this product and Origins brand are the ones that work well with my skin type. The price and easy buying from Amazon.com, makes it convenient for me too. For some reason since I moved to California, I got skin redness and breakouts. This product helped with that, way better than all of the other things I tried (rosewater, argan oil, night creams etc) good This is the best product!  I love how soft and luxurious my face feels after using the cleanser. I've always loved FAB Cleanser.  Super gentle and non-drying, but cleans well. This is my absolute favorite face wash of all time. I know it is pretty expensive, but nothing does a better job of keeping my face clear than this product. lovely I love this facial cleanser.  It is so gentle and doesn't dry out my skin like many other products. Great product. Great price! Would highly recommend Best face wash!  Cleared up my stubborn under the skin pimples in a week.  I have re ordered this product three times I love it!  You only need a pea size to cover your whole face, and you feel so clean after. One of my favorite cleanser gentle yet effective and doesn't stripSkin! Cleans well and is gentle on my sensitive skin. Takes very little to foam up. Removes most makeup, stings if gets in eyes. I use it with 5-in-1 daily face moisturizer for a simple and effective daily routine. My skin is happy! I have very sensitive skin and often break out with any other products. This is the first face wash I can use without causing skin irritation - I also use their face cream with no issues. Been using both these products for almost a year. Redness and dryness have definitely improved. A little goes a long way. Takes off makeup extremely well. I love this cleanser. Makes my face feel great and cleans it great Great product! best ever I have combination skin and this face wash gives me life. It has made pimples vanish overnight. I love it! Great product at a great price. Won't clear up acne, but also doesn't cause any irritation. Gentle on dry skin. Good simple face wash. I use with my clarisonic. LOVE this cleanser. Gentle, and effective, and perfect for my combination skin. Best make up removing cleanser ever. This is my FAVORITE face cleanser! It is gentle on your skin and leaves a clean and smooth feeling afterwards. I love this cleanser-- it cleans well without drying or aggravating my dry sensitive skin!I love F.A.B. products-- I am a 3rd generation user of an expensive brand that you can only get in retail stores, but they were constantly changing their formulas to add ingredients that aggravated my skin.  I found F.A.B. and none of their products have made my skin react- I'll be a user for life! Delivered on time. Product is brand new.I have been using this for nearly one week. It leaves your skin clean without feeling dry or itchy. It removes the dirt very good. I developed small breakouts on my forehead that persisted for two months, after rotating through my normal face routine, I tried this cleanser.  It has been four days and not only has my forehead cleared up but the tone of my face has evened out and the oil on the pores of my noes are less noticeable.  I am EXTREMELY happy with the results.  I have very sensitive skin and have issues with facial product especially.  This has not irritated my face at all, if anything it has neutralized and made everything happy. I have sensitive skin, and this is the first face cleanser that works really well for me. It's only take a little bit so I anticipate it lasting quite a long time. I swear by this face wash Removes makeup as promised. Controls breakouts for me, my new staple for skin care I have super sensitive skin with eczema and dry flakes. This is the best line of products I’ve ever used! best facial cleanser i have ever tried and i have tried alot. i have very oily and acne proned skin and after using this every night for a month, all my breakouts were gone. I really like the faoming action and it doesn't have much sent. Love this cleanser. Just bought my second tube. really happy with this cleaner. It is gentle on my sensitive skin, but still feels like it is cleaning. Does not leave my skin dry or irritated. I love this product. It works well, is hydrating, and creamy, and has a descent scent. Love it.  Have bought twice already.  Great for sensitive skin! Love it My favorite cleanser. I double cleanse with my clarisonic and it yes all my makeup off. A favorite of mine! Love this product! I am left with a clean face whenever I use this and it is not to harsh on my sensitive face! Thanks..... I love love love this! I have such sensitive skin and this is gentile yet affective. I will never buy another fast wash. I just used this for the first time today and it did a great job getting my pores clean. To me this is a big deal because most cleansers I have tried still leave dirt or blackheads on my skin.It was pretty frustrating but I heard about this stuff and I was curious if it would work. It lathers up really nice and it doesn't take much. There's not much of a scent to it but best of all most of the dirt and blackheads came out of my pores! I am so happy with this product!  Also it didn't dry my skin out - which is awesome because I am prone to horribly dry skin. The Fab Ultra Repair Cream works great with this cleanser. Will reorder both products again! Gentle and effective facial cleanser. I swear by it! Nothing to say except - cleans and leaves no residue. Gentle on skin and goes well with other First Air Products My son uses this and he loves it.  I have also started using it and I like it as well. Product I use. Arrived as expected. Love this face wash so good I waited until I was done with the bottle to review it fully, so I knew exactly how it worked on my skin.I have dry sensitive skin that breaks out at the slightest hint of change from my normal routine. I used to use the angel cleanser from lush, but that was way too expensive and didnt really treat any breakouts I had. I turned to this cleanser because I read reviews from so many make up artists that I followed who said it was their holy grail, so I decided to give it a try.Boy am I glad I did. This cleanser is gentle, but still targets breakouts and leaves my face feeling squeaky clean but not dry. I still get a few pimples here and there during stressful times, but this cleanser in addition to a spot treatment is enough to take care of it before they turn into nasty zits.The bottle lasts forever too! I bought this exactly one year ago, have been using it every single day and still have cleanser left in the bottle. Definitely worth the price. Acne prone skin. This stuff works wonders nice I love this product for it cleans my skin but does not dry it out!  I feel it is the perfect balance for a facial cleanser! I love this stuff, worth the price.. Super mild, leaves your face feeling clean without dyes or perfume or overdrying. i like this because it removes the oil, grime and dirt off of your face without over-drying the skin and it clears up any pimples or break outs. The ingredients are pretty good. 5 stars and worth it. I think this will be my staple facial cleanser forever! :) We got a sample of this at our local Sephora when we purchased some other things and my daughter fell in love with it.  You use very little to wash your face and it takes off makeup too.  She loves the way it clears her skin and keeps her face very fresh.  It's rather expensive at Sephora so we did some research and found it here for the best price Brightens my skin and rids of break outs. I love this ! Gentle on skin and leaves face squeaky clean! Expensive but worth it! I love this product soo much ! I absolutely LOVE this face cleanser. It is nice and creamy that lathers slightly. It leaves your skin feeling soft yet clean. It is the only cleanser I've tried that really removes makeup. I also have rosacea and this does wonders on my super sensitive skin. I can't say enough about this stuff! Doesn’t dry out my skin, removes makeup very well A creamy, great lather, use with my clarisonic. Does not dry skin. A very nice cleanser at a good price. Great product I love this cleanser.  I first used it when I got a sample from Sephora and decided to buy a bottle after using up the sample.  This retailer sells it for the same amount as Sephora - but Sephora charges shipping on orders under $50, so if you have Amazon Prime, this is the better option if you're ordering online.  The great thing about it is that it cleanses deeply without irritating my sensitive skin.  It also removes all of my eye makeup, so I don't have to use an additional eye makeup remover when I'm washing my face at night.The other thing I really enjoy is that it doesn't have much of a fragrance.  It smells clean, but not overpowering or like perfume. Just a little bit expensive... Goes on so gently, cleanses beautifully and leaves my skin feeling extremely soft! LOVE this cleanser! After a recommendation from a friend who does makeup professionally, I got this because I had been having hormonal acne breakouts and wanted something gentle for my skin. I think I'll end up buying this again...although it's not the cheapest option, it's CERTAINLY not expensive, and definitely worth the price. It's a white, soft liquid and you really don't need to apply very much for one use. I haven't had any breakouts since I started using it, although I did also get a prescription topical cream that I started using at the same time, so I can't promise it was this cleanser alone that solved my problem. BUT it definitely helps, and I highly recommend it! Easy use , clean well and not dry after used. Love this cleanser, cleans thoroughly without drying out your skin. Tightens skin too. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! Very gentle as it says. It is really really good for sensitive skin. I highly recommend it. No fragrance or harsh chemicals. It removes all my eye makeup and leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft. The is perfect for everyday use. I love the whole FAB line. it cleaned the dirt off my face.  first i had dirt then no more.  good stuff, i recommend it.  i will be buying this again. This is the best cleanser I've ever used, I won't use anything else. Love it. I have ordered all their skincare products. Best Cleanser I have found to go with my Clarisonic system. It removes all traces of makeup and grime without drying out my skin. All the First Aid Beauty products I have  ever tried are good, and this one is no exception. It also rinses easily, which is a great plus in my opinion because when cleansers do not rinse completely, they tend to leave a muddy layer that inhibits that radiant appeal we all strive for.I recommend this for anyone who wants a gentle cleanser that does its job leaving your face ready to better absorb whatever treatment product you use. I've been using this for about 30 days and I am really happy with it. I have problem skin and am on a dermatologist prescribed skin cocktail so I needed something that wasn't going to do anything other than moisturize and clean. You don't need a lot and it actually does foam up a bit with the right amount of water. I don't have any issues rinsing it away but usually use a wash cloth to rinse off for a little extra exfoliating. I don't find that it works all that well to remove mascara- but I always use an eye make-up remover anyway. I think I have found my new face wash! leaves my dry skin soft and not tight.  Removes makeup well and I would recommend for sensitive skin.  I get seborreac and FAB has not given me any breakouts This is just amazing! I love to use this product! LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. I was using the wrong type of cleanser on my face that caused dry skin, redness and breakouts. I used this product to attempt to restore my skin back to normal-was not disappointed. It not only met but exceeded my expectations. I would recommend this to anyone who has dry or sensitive skin that needs a gentle cleanser that works hard. Love this ! Great product This is gentle, has a nice clean smell and does a great job removing all traces of makeup.  I will purchase again. I had an extremely dry t-zone, forehead, and nose because of a tea tree cleanser I had been using. After trying this product for 4 days, the dry skin was completely gone. As a bonus, my blemishes were mostly gone too! Love this product, especially if you have super sensitive skin. Does not irritate and a, little goes a long way I have struggled with stubborn acne since I was a teenager. I tried FAB from a recommendation from a lady at Sephora and couldn't be more amazed. I have used antibiotics and medically prescribed washes and this is the first one that clears up my face and keeps it clear. I ran out for a couple weeks and tried to use stuff from the drug store and my skin looked HORRIBLE. I'll suck it up and pay the price and order again before I run out! I don't have sensitive skin (I have oily) and I Love this stuff! My face feels so refreshed and gently cleaned. Will be repurchasing. This was my second tube of this face cleanser. I really liked the way the cleanser made my face feel fresh and smooth after use. It really felt clean...almost like my face was taking a fresh breath of air! I will continue to re-order. I LOVE this soap.  I was using Dove for the longest (per my derm)  but just seemed to make my skin dull.This seems to really be helping.  I started the face pads at night soap in the morning and lotion after the soap.  My skin purged at first but really seems to be clearing up and brighter. I love that this face wash is gentle without scary chemicals in it and compared to a lot of other high end non-drugstore brands, I love the price too. You get a pretty hefty bottle for twenty bucks. I think it's worth the money. It leaves my face super soft. My skin feels clean without being dried out. I have finally found a face wash I will buy over and over again. Absolutely LOVE this product! I've used a doctor recommended cleanser for 10 years now because of acne problems, but it always left my skin feeling dry and flaky. Since I have very sensitive, acne prone skin, I have been hesitant to try different products. I'm so glad I got over my fear. First Aid Beauty Cleanser works wonders and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. It does not irritate my skin or cause any break outs, and has actually improved my skin. I look forward to washing my face every morning and night! I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to try something new. I really like this face wash! It takes off my makeup at the end of the day, and it makes my skin feel very smooth. No irritation, no breakouts. I use this with the facial radiance pads and ultra repair moisturizer. It seems to be a good routine for my combo skin. I love this face wash. It's simple, it's not drying. It really leaves you feeling clean. Gentle but not so gentle that you feel like you didn't do anything. I'm in love with this. I have combination skin that has semi frequent breakouts, and this stuff is perfect. I LOVE First Aid Beauty Products!  It's very hard to find skin care brands without multiple chemicals that actually work!  I'm happy to say I have not been disappointed by any of their products! I'm 35 with fine wrinkles and oily skin, this face wash works wonderfully for me. It gets rid of the oil without drying my face out, a combination that is very hard to achieve. This cleanser is an excellent option for dry, sensitive, or combination skin. A small amount generates a decent lather, and it removes makeup, dirt, and oil without over-drying skin or causing irritation. My skin is extremely sensitive and prone to redness, which makes my cleanser options very limited. A lot of the sensitive skin formulas cause break outs, which can create a pendulum of skin conditions, swinging back and forth without any real resolution. Thankfully, there's no irritation with this cleanser and no scent whatsoever, and it easily rinses away without leaving that familiar tightness that comes when cleansers go too far. It's a cream cleanser, which means it's not a good option if you're someone who prefers to scrub with a sponge, and it doesn't offer any exfoliating properties. Because of this, using a mask or another cleanser at least once a week to remove dead skin cells is necessary to keep skin healthy. This cleanser is also an excellent option if you simply want to establish an affordable, basic skin cleansing routine. Great wash! It makes my face feel squeaky clean after a long day of makeup. That being said it doesnt leave my skin feeling tight or dry. I love this face wash. I use it with my Clarisonic and it removes my makeup nicely and leaves my skin feeling clean. I love when I can buy it on Amazon for a few dollars less than the local stores as well! I use the FAB skincare system: cleanser, ultra repair cream, lip moisturizer, and the facial radiance pads. I absolutely love the system, but this product is my favorite. Lightweight, removes makeup, leaves face soft and glowing. This product is amazing. I had a travel sized version that I was trying and loved it so much, I HAD to buy the full size. This is one of the only products I have ever tried that has made an impact in my skin. I am 21 and  have combo/acne prone skin, and this product keeps my skin clear and feeling awesome. I love this stuff and can't live without it.If you have tried other products that have acne fighting ingredients and don't see results, I suggest trying this product.. This is the only face wash I've tried so far that doesn't irritate my skin or break me out. It isn't drying but it cleans well at the same time. No scent and it has a nice rich lather. My breakouts have actually decreased with this face wash. I bought this facial cleanser recommended by a beauty guru youtuber.  I don't regret it!  Very gentle cleanser, yet effective.  Love it. This is all I use on my face, takes off my makeup and doesn't make me breakout (I have really acne prone skin) makes my face feel like it's actually clean and makes me look like I actually have a home. I wanted to start getting in the habit of washing my face twice a day since the warm weather is coming  this makes my face clear, clean, soft, and makes a perfect canvas for makeup. Really good face wash:) Used to use the Fresh Soy Facewash after receiveing it as a birthday gift from Sephora. Loved it, but so expensive. This is a great, gentle, cheaper alternative and lasts me for months at a time. Highly recommend for all skin types. This face cleanser is absolutely perfect. It's non-drying. Washes off any kind of makeup easily (eyeliner, mascara, bb-cream, etc.)Love it. I love this face wash so much. It is the first face wash I have found that actually does not dry out my skin. I have been free of breakouts and it is fantastic. I have somewhat dry skin and I love this product. I will definitely be buying again! Very happy with the cleanser.  Leaves face soft after using and washes off easily. Clean, gentle, perfect for aging skin. Really enjoy using this product! I have used it for months and doesn't irritate or dry out my skin. I feel that it really cleans off dirt and makeup. Highly recommend it! Surprisingly I like this better than Purity Made Simple. It's that good. Easy to use, no stimulation. Best cleanser with lather that feels so good on your face. This cleanser has done miracles to my face. I have acne-prone skin and this gently cleanses and uncloggs my pores when I remove my makeup, it helps a lot with breakouts and makes your skin softer. Nice essence and texture. Love love love it! Great cleanser. Leaves my skin really soft Love first aid beauty and this cleanser is the focal point of the whole line in my opinion. I have very fair, sensitive skin which gets irritated & red very easily. I find this to be the only cleanser that really works miracles on my skin!!!! I love the super creamy texture. I use it with my clarisonic brush and it works miracles!! I have tried different things over the years and I will never switch again.If you have sensitive skin, you have to give this a try! The tube is big and lasts me at least 2 months, washing twice a day. You only need a quarter size dab! Awesome product and will be trying more than just the lotion and cleanser soon! good Love this product - we are all addicted to it at our house. Love this product, really gross with my red areas on my face. Gentle and yet it really cleans my face.  I have really sensitive skin, but then I also get clogged pores. I've tried to go more aggressive with products and it always backfires on me. This is a gentle and effective face cleanser.  Buy with confidence! I got a sample of this with my Clarisonic and I really liked it so I decided to buy again. The cleanser is very gentle, no irritations or harsh smells. This truly is the best facial wash I have ever used. When I entered my 20s I started to develop acne, something that I never had an issue with before. I have tried EVERYTHING. An exorbitant amount of different drug store facial washes. Expensive face washes - Lancôme, Clinique, etc. Also attempted a multitude of different types of skin care routines. No change. But then....then I found this gem. A friend recommended it to me. I have been using it for 3 months and my skin has never looked better. Acne cleared, I have a brightness and softness to my skin that I didn't have before. I use this, a Lancôme toner, then Ponds moisturizer morning and night. I also exfoliate once a week. I highly recommend this product. I only use this to wash my face- normally I purchase from Sephora (but it's overpriced there) however- it's the only place I could ever find this. When I saw this sold on Amazon & for 20$ for 5oz, it was too good to be true, but I realized it was sold directly from the manufacturer. So I bought it. When it arrived it was perfect- even had the seal. I used it this morning & it's definitely legit. Now I'll only ever order it this way VS buying at Sephora (where I get 1.2oz for 15$). My 13 year researched this particular product. I will let pics speak for themselves I have sensitive, acne prone skin.  Prescription creams and pills keep my acne (mostly) at bay, but I still struggle with skin redness, especially in the wintertime.  Accordingly, I've been trying to choose products specifically meant for my skin type.  I've had great experiences with other First Aid Beauty products (their mask is AMAZING and one of my go-to's along with GlamGlow for keeping my skin hydrated and glowing in the winter months).  I hadn't tried any of their cleansers though so I decided to give it a try.I love that the texture is rich and creamy. It works well with my Clarisonic as I found no traces of makeup when I followed up my cleaning with a toner.  I also like that although it is rich, it feels light and gentle on my face while I'm cleaning.  No stinging, burning, or itching, which is great.  It also washes clean without much effort, neither overdrying my skin or leaving a residue behind.  I'm also not sure if it is my imagination, but my skin looked less pink after cleaning it with this cleanser than it does with most I have tried.  Those who are sensitive to added fragrances and perfumes will also appreciate that this seems to have no added fragrances.  The scent is quite mild and benign, neither good nor bad.It also worked very well with the First Aid Beauty Dual Repair Face Cream I applied after.Overall, I really, really like this cleanser.  Having tried several of the FAB products it is clear they really understand sensitive skin and this product shows that understanding and commitment As a 45-yr-old who has suffered from acne since I was 12, I'm always searching for the best acne products available. I recently ordered a product other than this one and thought I'd found the best acne cleanser yet. However, I was wrong! The First Aid Beauty Gentle Cleanser is by far THE BEST acne face wash! It makes your face feel so clean, easily removes makeup, and reduces pore size. I will say I've noticed it bringing already-existing pimples to the top, which needs to happen for them to heal. My face is also just a bit dry after use, but it doesn't last long at all. I'm so impressed with this product and intend to continue use. I've even ordered the repair cream. I'm 29 with oily/acne prone skin that is very sensitive and prone to redness and peeling. This cleanser is the most soothing thing I have ever put on my face. It is mild, moisturizing without leaving me oily, and actually feels good on the skin as you use it. I use this as my morning face wash and my skin is so soft, smooth, and even toned since I added it to my routine. It is winter where I live right now and my face is much less flaky and irritated than it normally is this time of year, and my skin actually looks smooth. Being a big fan of the FAB ultra repair cream, I had to give this cleanser a try.  I have tried so many different facial cleansers, cleansing wipes, and skin care systems over the years that it takes a lot to impress me.  This one did not disappoint.  I love that it is unscented (I don;t need perfume in my facial cleanser!), foamy, takes off all my makeup and cleanses my face in one-step.  It leaves my skin so soft, not dry or tight.  My only complaint and it is tiny, is that this product does sting if you accidentally get it in or open your eyes.  Now I just make sure to keep my eyes tightly closed when removing my eye makeup and until I have splashed all the soap off.  I have somewhat sensitive skin and occasionally breakout from new products and had zero issues with this.  I also think it has helped clear some occasional/hormonal acne and I have noticed some small always there bumps now disappearing.  I love that is comes in a convenient tube in various sizes (the 1 and 2 oz are great for travel) so there is no mess.  I have even used this in the shower all over my body in lieu of body wash when I forgot my soap on a business trip!  No issues - in fact, I love the way my skin felt so I may just pack this in the future! I love this Face Cleanser.  It is gentle on the skin and does not dry out my face.  I finally found the perfect cleanser for me.  I keep a tube in the shower to use with my Clarisonic on my face each morning.  I also use it at night after I remove my makeup.  I am a frequent purchaser of this product.  In fact I just reordered two tubes!  If you are on the fence about purchasing this product, try it.  You will be pleased with the results. First Aid Beauty Face Cleanser, 5 Ounce This is the best face cleanser I've ever used! After just one use I see and feel a noticeable difference. My face was very soft and smooth and all acne is gone! I highly recommend this, trust me it's worth every penny. This stuff does as advertised. It's a non-scented (even though it smells like crayola crayons to me), ok for sensitive skin (I have rosacea and it doesn't exacerbate my condition) cleanser. This product is pretty effective at removing everything, including any moisture from your face so make sure to moisturize afterwards. This is the only cleanser I use. It is not pricey and completely dissolved makeup - including stubborn mascara and liner. I have not had any reaction and believe me I react to EVERYTHING. I like it's non-drying formulation. I also like foaming rather than creamy formulas. Was glad I found this after the other manufacturer stopped making the one I used for years. I also use their moisturizer. Easy on, easy off and the result was excellent. It works, and that is what we look for when we're promised the long list of results that each company put out there. I'm always delighted when I get a product that actually delivers on its promise. I love this cleanser and it leaves my face feeling clean and not tight. I'm on my third tube and will be back for more. A winner! I love this cleanser! I love other first aid beauty products, so I had high hopes for this face wash. It has a creamy consistency and foams really well. Takes off basic mascara and eye shadow easily and leaves my face moisturized. I (wife) have super super sensitive skin and this does not irritate me. PH balance is perfect (I checked with PH strip), too. I erase my makeup with cleansing oil first and then wash my face with this. If I only had sunblock for the day, I'd use cleansing water (original one) from Garnier and then wash with this cleanser. I will repurchase! I have a small amt of eczema, contact dermatitis (skin allergies). When I have a flareup, this face wash combined with the Ultra repair cream works fantastic and nips it in the bud. If you're someone who has any skin sensitivities or allergies, this line would work great for you. This stuff is amazing; the only face wash I buy and it seems like I've tried it all. Its great for all skin types in my opinion, but works wonderfully with sensitive skin. Removes eye makeup incredibly easy; you won't need any other product for eye makeup removal. I used to have fairly bad uneven skin and pimples, but after weeks of using this, I've seen a change in how my face looks! barley any breakouts and my skin tone evened out! I was impressed by the results. This stuff is safe for people who have sensitive and dry skin (I have eczema, so a cleanser that's safe is a must. I's great for washing off makeup and keeping pimples at bay. Use at least twice a day and no more (cleaning your face more than once in a day just promotes dryness as well as oilyness). I recommend this product for nearly all sensitive skin types. Overall, I give this product a 5 stars. I had acne on my forehead a couple years ago and have been using this and my skin is super clear. If you have never tried this i suggest you SPOT TEST in case you have a bad reaction like other people. Everyone’s skin is different. In my experience i have had nothing but amazing results. Personally, i would not order from this exact seller because i never got my order... buy it from a different seller. :) I have really sensitive skin so I have to be careful what I use. I was was using cetaphil for many years but I was finding that it really wasn't removing my makeup very well and causing me to break out due to that. I was using a makeup remover first and then cetaphil and it just seemed silly. I did some research and a lot of people were raving about this product. I was a little nervous to make the switch but it was the best decision I have made!It not only keeps my skin clear but it removes all signs of makeup as well. I have been using it for a few months and am in love! I used to get red blotchy spots on my face with using the Clinique line of face cleansers and lotion. A dermatologist told me that it was too harsh for my sensitive skin, but didn't offer me any alternatives. I tried this (based on a recommendation from Sephora) and haven't gone back since. My skin feels clean and the blotches have dramatically reduced. I've been using this for about 2 years now. I use the face wash and ultra repair cream, and the combo works well for me. I just ordered this facial cleanser on Monday, and it came very quickly with the 2 day shipping. I had on a face full of makeup and decided to test it out for the first time to see if it takes my make up off. And let me tell you, it took all of my foundation off, eyeshadow, and brow makeup as well. It also took off most of my mascara except for a little bit. But thats probably because I wear waterproof. This cleanser does not give you that tight feeling of the skin after you wash your face. It lathers up beautifully and feels so silky smooth! I will update my review after I have tried it for a while. I have oily acne prone skin, so I am hoping this clears it up nicely. Perfect for sensitive skin. I can't wait to see the way this will change my skin. Just after the first wash, I can already see it's going to be amazing! I encourage you to buy this if you have sensitive skin. You won't regret it! :) I have sensitive combination skin and this is the best cleanser I have ever used. It is extremely lightweight and all you need is a tiny bit for your entire face. This bottle lasts FOREVER. It leaves my face feeling smooth, and also gets rid of my makeup, including eye makeup. It doesn't irritate your eyes at all. Will definitely continue to purchase this cleanser! I was asked by Amazon if this product was easy to apply and if it needed to be reapplied during the day.  I think the assumption may be that this is makeup.  This cleanser is great!  It gets ""They're Real"" mascara by Benefit off better than anything else, and if you know how well that mascara stays you know that's saying something.  Not drying at all and I have very sensitive skin. This face cleanser is one of the best I've used. And I've used a lot due to my combination skin. I also hate using conventional makeup removers that just left my skin dry and very acne prone.  I used this ever night to remove my makeup, even all my eye makeup. It romvoes everything. No need to take a q-tip to my eyes to get ride of access eyeliner.  It's soft and doesn't irritate the eyes or cheeks, no burning, or ichiness. This stuff truly is the best. I am a forever customer with first aid beauty!  Get it!  You won't regret it! This face wash is super gentle on my sensitive skin. I tried it once when traveling and hit up a Sephora since I forgot to bring my normal face wash. Turned out it was a good thing because this gets the job done with very little product. If you have sensitive skin like me this is your facial cleanser. I use in the winter and summer - all year round!!! It does not dry up your skin and even removes a ton of makeup. No harsh chemicals. Clean, soft and lots of lather. Great for combination and sensitive skin like mine. This face wash has replaced my Neutrogena Foaming cleanser. It removes all traces of make up without overly drying my face. It's gentle and doesn't break out my acne prone 34 yr old skin. Their radiance pads are awesome to use as a toner after cleansing with this wash! I love trying new products, but my skin is really sensitive. This is basically my go-to recovery cleanser that I use whenever something gives me a bad skin reaction and I can't trust anything else to not make it worse. It's very mild and gentle on my skin (although not as gentle as the Fresh Soy Cleanser because I do have to remember to avoid my eyes with this one) but it is fragrance free and doesn't contain any harsh or irritating ingredients. I also love that this brand is completely cruelty free. Love this facewash! I've used it every night for a year and it is the perfect balance to actually get my face clean and all my makeup off, without drying out or irritating my skin. You definitely need to pair it with the ultimate repair cream moisturizer. I break out with almost anything. I'm not one of those people who like the ""purging"" effect before you see results and most of the time your left with a red blotchy face waiting for the inflammation to go down and sometimes it just gets worse and no good results come from other facial cleansers. You don't see amazing results after one use, but it does its job and doesn't irritate or make your acne worse. After months of using it, I don't get really huge zits anymore. It took time, but I'm glad I didn't have to purge to see results. Best gentle facial cleanser. Shipping was excellent. My absolute favorite ace wash products!  Leaves my face feeling truly clean and stay clear. I am a person with VERY sensitive skin, acne prone and this product does not cause me irritation or discomfort and my face is clearer than it has been in a long time. Recently found they have a body wash as well and I plan on adding that to my collection as well! I started using this facewash after getting pregnant, and it has helped control my hormonal acne so well! Life changing.  I had an irritation on my face and finally went to my dermo.  She suggested i use this.  I was using Clinique products but i think they changed something in their formula.  I made all the teens in my house use this instead.  Love it!! This product has been a lifesaver! My skin has always been very sensitive and prone to hormonal breakouts, and this product has pretty much cleared my skin up aside from the occasional breakout. Also love that this product has natural ingredients and rates a 1 on the EWG skin deep website! I bought this for winter when my face was breaking out due to dryness, however I have continued to use it the entire year. I absolutely love this stuff. Going on my second year of use and see no signs of switching! I love First Aid Beauty products. This cleanser is particularly gentle and great for my acne-prone skin. I haven't been this clear in years! I use this cleanser with the Daily Radiance Pads, and I am obsessed!! I have tried every acne product on the market, and really, this works for my troubled skin. Great cleanser. A little goes a long way.  I only need a pea sized or less for each time I wash my face.  I have eczema and I find it very gentle and great at removing non-eye makeup.  However, I've learned that I cannot leave it on like a mask or it will start drying my face.  I do plan on buying this again! One of the best cleansers around. Cleared the redness in my skin and takes off stubborn sunscreen without stripping skin. I LOVE this stuff. It foams, it's gentle and it takes off all of my makeup. And the Environmental Working Group rates it a 1. Love that. It's pricey but you only need a dime size amount. I have super sensitive skin that reacts to most cleansers. This one doesn't bother me. It removes make up without drying too. best cleanser i have yet to come across. it removes your makeup completely but it is not too strong for your skin.leaves your skin clean and smooth. the smooth feeling is not from the residue of the make up!! it is from the cleanser's moisturizing aspect Nice, clean refreshing cleanser for someone who have sensitive skin but wants a nice, foamy clean feeling face. Great when you have a face full of make-up and need to wash it off and have that squeaky clean feeling, no stickiness or greasy feeling afterwards. This has worked really well for me. It foams up nicely- similar to the consistency of shaving pot cream. With a pea-sized amount, it is able to remove makeup and bring my face back to its (almost squeaky) clean state. I haven't tried removing eye makeup with this, but it does a great job at removing foundation, blush, eyebrow pencil -- don't have residual makeup on the cotton pad when I apply toner afterward. Will add this to my list of favorite beauty products. This cleanser is my hands down favorite cleanser. As I have moved on from my teens, my skin has started to change a lot, and I needed a new cleanser because Cetaphil was becoming too harsh. This product is so gentle and so effective; it gets rid of the oil from my skin without drying it out. I have tried face products that range from $50 to $5, and this product has been the absolute best.I have oily combo skin, and during the winter, my skin turns really dry. I use this product year round. Their red clay cleanser is amazing, too!The smell is a little strong, but for the benefits, this product is completely worth it. I have fairly normal, combination skin (slightly oily in the T-zone and chin, normal elsewhere but for a few dry patches.) The thing that drives me crazy is my eyelids. I don't know what it is, but since I hit 40, my eyelids are so oily after waking up it's like I had an olive oil facial. The only thing that got rid of the oil was oatmeal soap, and that did the opposite - stripped my skin bare.I've tried several face washes via Sephora Favorites, and I came across this one. I was wowed! It takes the icky grease off my eyelids, but leaves the rest of my skin smooth, pampered, and soft, not stripped! Imagine a product that can get rid of oil  yet leave the rest of your skin healthy!This is my HG for face washing! The minute I'm tempted to try something else, within two days, I'm back to FAB. Best cleanser ever! this is the most pleasant and only ""moisturizing and face wash I used... I m a guy. The first tube was pick up for me by a girlfriend. I have dry skin.I use it daily as a combo moisturizer and shave cream. After the first application I was a convert. Just tossed the first tube after 4 solid months of use. My skin is now normal. Women understand this stuff. Neanderthals took a while before the fire was used for cooking :) I really like this cleanser, it feels really gentle, do not have perfume (which is a plus for me). The skin feels clean but not tight or anything."
B01NAV2BD2," Great face wash! Very light, not harsh at all! It makes my face feel wonderful! Excellent product. My face felt clean and soft. Im glad that it is natural and vegan. Great! Good deep clean. Helped soothe the redness on my face!! Hope it continues to help my skin I am now a big fan of Beauty by Earth. I have super dry skin and all of the this foaming face wash has helped me manage my skin from acne outbreaks and dryness. I highly recommend this!!! This face wash rocks! My face feels clean but not dried out after using it. This is a big deal to me as I naturally have very dry skin. I also really like how natural the ingredients are. Great face wash. My teenage daughter uses this daily. Has a mild clean scent. Leaves face feeling fresh. Hasn't had any breakouts since using this product. We will definitely purchase again I absolutely love this product. I have very sensitive skin and it does not bother me. It smells almost like baby powder. Sometimes I add a little baking soda for a sluffing scrub. I was worried that it wouldn't suds up like my other facial cleanser, but no problem. It smells really good also. Leaves my face felling clean and smoothe. I'm really particular about what I use on my face. From reading about this foaming face wash it sounded exactly for me so thought I'd give it a go. My face is a combination. I have oily skin but also require moisturizing. This face wash is absolutely amazing and somehow handles both needs! It completely clears up any oil while also rehydrating at the same time. And honestly there are so many natural and organic products out there that just don't work - this stuff does. I'm in love. I bought this about a month ago and wanted to give it a try before reviewing. Well, my daughter (who is 13) and I, both LOVE it! It's not oily, washes away easily, has the most pleasant scent, and leaves the skin clean and rejuvenated... both of us would definitely recommend it for a daily cleanser. Great stuff.  Even though I'm a dude, I bought it for my face.  After being away for a week eating hardcore restaurant food my face was a mess.  Face feels good after I wash with this not all hella-tight and dry, even though I like that to I know its not good. Great foam, great clean, great smell.  What more can you ask of a facial cleansing product?  This is so much better than any OTC product I have purchased for facial cleansing.  I love the creamy, rich foam that doesn't disappear in your hands as you apply it to your face.  It removes 99% of the makeup, no matter the type.  Eye make up comes off, too.  However, you do have to use a moisturizer after use but that should be what you want to do anyway unless you have extremely oily skin. If you are looking for a deep cleansing, then you might not like this product.I really like this product because it's gentle. I finally think I found a cleanser that does not make me break out. I have normal to dry skin (dry mainly in the winter). I wanted a cleanser that was really light and gentle. I was using water on my face for awhile instead of cleansers because they all tend to break me out. This cleanser does not do that and has a refreshing feel and smell to it. I use this product with the toner from this seller (which I love). This left my skin feeling fresh and clean. It did not dry out my skin. It has a light lovely scent, my husband even tried and liked. I like that is is all natural and chemical free. I can recommend This foaming face wash is so gentle on my sensitive skin.  It rinses off completely, has a pleasant scent, and this bottle will last you a while!  Half a pump is all you need! Great product!  Forgot to take off my makeup with makeup remover and just washed my face in the shower with this....when i got out i applied makeup remover and nothing was there.... Love that... it got rid of the makeupwhich i haven't experienced with other face washes.  Love the pump and you need very little to do the trick. Hooked! Definitely a quality product. Using it as my new go to face soap because it does actually get all of my makeup off better than my original makeup remover soap. But its gentle on my face which I appreciate. I love that it's a foaming soap so it lasts and it doesn't dry my face. The only thing I wasn't used to was the essential oil used in it was a bit stronger than I was expecting (in terms of scent). But it's all natural essential oil and I have no reaction to it, so it's all good. I'd definitely recommend it, especially since I totally trust this brand. I like the foam it makes and the scent is light and very nice. I didn't expect much but my face felt super nice, soft and smooth after using it (and I didn't put any lotion or anything after using it). I don't use make-up but I got it to keep my skin clean, and that it did. Refreshing! I am very pleased with it! :) This face wash is very soothing. It has not dried out my face. It controls my adult acne which used to be horrible. The ingredients are safe so I'm not worried about toxic ingredients found in most face washes. I love the foam. I think it willMake the bottle last way longer than it would if it were a serum or other consistency. Impressed!!! I am a licensed Aesthetician and i have never heard of this brand! Why not?? Im in love! I love this face wash❤️ Removed my makeup and my skin feels amazing! Very gentle face wash.  It doesn't irritate my skin.  Removes makeup very well.  I don't get that dry, tight feeling after use.....but I do moisturize immediately after washing. I was expecting the foam to make more of a lather but it gets the job done. Only need to use abou half to one pump to get a good clean feeling and it has a nice scent. My skin was a little sensitive to it the first time I used it but I think I used too much, I use less now and works just as well. I have sensitive skin and have to be very careful about what I use. I chose this because it has natural ingredients and the reviews I read indicated it would be a good product to try. My skin is very dry and this face wash left my skin feeling soft and refreshed, not dry and tight. I'm so glad I found this face wash! I will be purchasing more for myself and my teens. I bought this face wash for my teen daughter. She is obsessed with beauty products and she has used many different kinds and brands of face wash. She loves this brand! I love that it is natural and organic! She uses it every night. Will definitely buy more when she runs out. I have purchased many products from this company and I am always satisfied with the product and costumer service. I love their Facial Cleanser and find this works best with my skin but when I saw their Foaming Face Wash decided to try it to and compare it to their Facial Cleanser. Both very good face washes and you can't go wrong with either of them. The Foaming Face Wash smells amazing!!! As with all of their products, I love the scent, it is subtle but divine. A little of this face wash goes a long way. It is gentle on the skin, does not dry it out but still takes off all my make up and leaves it feeling clean and soft. This foaming facial cleanser is absolutely amazing!!! My skin feels very clean, the cleanser has a fresh, chemical free fragrance and it is made with organic products. This product leaves my skin very soft and I can definitely tell that my skin is clean after using this cleanser. BUY IT! You will not be disappointed I've been using this for about a week now and I really love it! Totally gets face clean but it doesn't feel stripped either. A little goes a long way, so seems very worth the money in how long a bottle will last. I got this a few days ago and I used it right away. I really like it, the foam is very light, it cleanses the skin very well. I easly break out that hasn’t happend, makes me happy. Can recommend! Great face soap.  A bit too good at drying my oily skin.  I use a light moisturizer and its then great.  It also removes makeup, even smudge proof liquid eyeliner. Using an all natural/ organic face wash really helps keep my acne controlled. I won't ever go back to using the generic acne face soaps. This stuff doesn't dry your face out either, I wash mine twice a day! Feels very clean without feeling like my skin has been stripped. Like all of the products in their line, I really like the scent. :) So happy to find an organic FOAMING cleanser for my husband! Works great. He says it feels clean and fresh and not drying. Good find! I first got this with the purpose of getting my kids to use it but decided to give it a shot myself. As a guy it can feel  unmanly  to use these sort of products but must say it felt really good and now it's been about 4 days I've been using it and I like it. Love how this face wash foams up. My face feels clean yet not tight afterwards. Really glad I found this product! I like how good it feels on my face when I use it. Fresh and no odors and easy to spread and use. I didn't have a whole lot of acne but I did have random pimples pop up and they were not pretty. After using this for 2 weeks I feel like when the blimishes do come they aren't as big and go away a lot quicker. I love foam cleansers and this one is exceptional. Face feels clean after using it and knowing it's natural and organic is awesome especially since I'm a breastfeeding mama. love this brand!  another great product!  left my face feeling clean and not dried out and the foam has a great texture!! I love this face wash!  Not only does it smell AMAZING (light hint of vanilla or something), but the fact that it's foaming makes it super easy to lather and rinse! Love this cleanser!  It cleans without striping my skin and I love the smell! The foaming face wash works great. I have dry skin and rocasea but it was gentle enough for my skin. It takes off all my makeup without leaving my skin dry. Makes my face feel very clean but doesn't dry my skin at all. It is not harsh and it smells really good.I will definitely order again. Wonderful, I love this! Awesome face wash !  It leave the skin soft, clean and great feeling. Bought this for my wife. She says it works well, foams up nicely and smells good. She uses it everyday. Within my first few uses I could tell it was very nourishing. I have dry skin and almost everything seems to make it worse, but that wasn't my experience with this. This product is amazing!! Best cleanser I’ve ever used, it doesn’t dry out my face like other cleansers it adds moisture so you don’t get that tight dry feeling after washing your face. It gets your face clean and smells really good. Definitely will be purchasing again.  :) Smells great, works well, rinses clean away. I love all the products from Beauty By Earth! I have most of them! Love it. It's super soft smells yummy and makes my face feel amazing! I really like this face wash. I love that when it dispenses out it is foamy. It smells really nice & the fact that it is made with natural ingredients is a huge plus! For sure a good buy :) Nice product.Very soft and delicate cleansed. My face skin so fresh and clean with it. And it is very delicious smell. Your face feels so fresh and clean! I love this foaming face wash! I have sensitive skin, and this really cleans my face well without any irritatation. Plus it smells great! Smells wonderful! Truly only need 1/2 pump to get a luxurious foamy lather. Rinses easily. Skin feels fresh and hydrated hours later. Smells great, works well"
B00QY1XZ4W," Love this stuff. Really makes my face feels clean. The best cleanser. Recommended by my dermatalogist Excellent, Very gentle on the skin. My skin feel so much softer. LOVE the Vanicream products! Good product for sensitive skin I like it. Very similar to the Dr. Denese  cleanser that costs considerably more. I will buy it again. Works as described.  Good product. My husband was put onto this product by his dermatologist.  It is very gentle and we love it. I love this product. It cleans so well and leaves my skin soft and hydrated. My entire family has begun using my face wash for the first time because they feel the same way. In fact after using the face wash I had to try the lotion. I love the lotion. Good bye to high end expensive cosmetics. I will be buying this product for a long time. I made the switch from Cetaphil Moisturizer Cleanser (not* Cetaphil face cleanser). I like how this cleanses, or at least foams more than Cetaphil cleanser. It does leave me a bit dryer than Cetaphil, but if you don't leave it on your face as long then it won't be an issue. The packaging was a concerning though. It came in a plastic bag and looked dinged up. Overall, the product is solid and the fact that it is a fragrance-free cleanser is an added bonus. My wife's dermatologist recommended this brand. My poor wife has so many allergies, one of the biggest problems we've run into is Parabens! They are in every product women use. This brand is paraben free and my wife loves hows this makes her face feel. A mild facial cleanser that doesn't leave my skin too dried out. Doesn't really have a scent, which is a plus. Follow this up with a good moisturizer and you can't go wrong! Exactly as advertised--gentle, no irritants, cleans the skin well without creating more problems than it solves. I would gladly repurchase it! This stuff rocks! No smell, no irritation, and it works great. Totally worth the price and usually a dollar or more cheaper on Amazon! This cleanser works great on my sensitive skin, and there are no harmful ingredients (that I know of) such as parabens or petrochemicals. I love this cleanser. It lathers nice and it’s gentle for my rosacea skin. My skin has really improved and I use cerave cream as a moisturizer. Love this face wash. It takes off all makeup, including mascara without irritation, leaving skin feeling silken and clean. Love vanicream products. I have eczema and was recently diagnosed with rosacea, (worst of both worlds) so my skin is extra sensitive and I break out easily. This stuff has helped a lot. It’s the only cleanser I use on my face This works very well on my face. The dermatologist recommended it as a cheaper alternative the Elta MD. Balanced Ph. recommended by a friend, and she said this kind of facial cleanser is very gentle, better than soap base. This is wonderful for trips away because I use it in the shower instead of bringing a bar of soap. I have very sensitive skin & am allergic to most soaps.  This facial cleanser works well for me.  My skin is softer & less outbreaks of eczema  since I started using Vanicream. Probably the ONLY cleanser I've ever tried where it doesn't make your skin feel dry but yet still feel clean afterwards, nor would it make your skin feel like it wasn't clean enough. Will likely buy for life. Very nice chemical free face soap, just takes a small drop to wash face . So effective, no scent. Product last forever as you don't need much. Great cleanser, I mainly use it for my hands and it works great. Gentle and light lotion without greasy feeling. Absorbs quickly gentle, foams without drying. cleans my skin....pure ingredients. great price. can pick it up at the drug store too if need be. Wash nightly with this soap.

I love my skin now! clean will not dry ur skin Very nice cleanser.  Gently removes dirt, oils, sunscreen, and makeup including mascara.  Has not dried out my skin or caused any redness. Great soap.

I've used everything under the sun - including brands such as Ole Henriksen, First Aid Beauty, Clarins, Dr. Jart, etc. etc. and this is the only facewash that has been gentle and cleared up my stubborn acne! I LOVE IT! Love all Vanicream products and this one doesn't disappoint.  I do wish they would wrap the products a bit better and put them in a box though.  All three lotions/cleansers I purchased together had broken or exploded while in transport to me.  Not a huge issue but do think something to work on. This is very soft and gentle. My dermatologist recommended it and I use it for my 3 Year old daughter this cleanser is super super gentle. the formula is suitable for my sensitive skin. i use it after the makeup remover and my face will not be extremely dry or breakout. love it 💅 This face wash is my favorite for my very sensitive skin.

My dermatologist recommended this to me, gave me samples and I have been using it ever since day and night.

Don't go dry because it could dry your face more especially if it is hot outside. Great for sensitive skin! Love it Works great! Nice foam, soft, leaves my skin smooth.

I strongly agree that this is worth my money Dermatologist recommented Love itIt's fragrance free Very soft and nice, I will order again. good product, nonallergic Very good product. Works perfectly on my very sensitive skin. It cleanses much better than Cetaphil.  It lathers nicely and it does NOT irritate! I just recently visited a dermatologist who told me to use this product to calm my eczema. Prior to using this product, I had tried what seems like every other product on the market. I could never find anything that wouldn't dry my skin out, make me itch, make my skin flake, burn my face, make me blotchy, etc. This product is so calming and gentle, and it keeps the natural moisture in your face locked in without making you greasy. I would recommend this product to anyone whos suffers from any form or severity of eczema. I used to use Proactiv, but it stopped working for me.  I went through many products looking for one that would work well before I found this one.  Now, I swear by Vanicream!  Definitely worth the price, and something I would highly recommend to anyone with sensitive skin!Update (08/2017): still using and swearing my this face wash. Now, I also use the moisturizer when needed, mostly in the winter. Both amazing products! love it Absolutely love this face wash! My skin is extremely sensitive and oily!!! Even lately my skin has been over producing oil making my face feel like I am a grease ball! I hate that feeling and had yet to find a face wash that didn't dry my face out or cause me to break out. After a visit to my dermatologist several months ago he recommended this and gave me several sample tubes. After using it for only a couple days my skin felt amazing! So amazing that I had to buy more! Totally would recommend this product! This,is the best ever moisturizer for your face all year long. It's light, not greasy and soaks in well. In the winter I add a drop of Argon oil to each application.  My husband and I share it and a bottle lasts us 10 months. Great, am allergic to scent, this is not-irritating, hard to find in stores My sister in law uses Vanicream moisturizer & my during my last visit, she recommended it to me, so I ordered it but it hasn't arrived yet so review to follow on that one. I found this face cleanser by Vanicream & decided to order it & ive used it three times over a week period so far & to date I haven't had any negative skin reactions to it & I have massively sensitive skin. So, I'm very happy with the results I've had so far & recommend this cleanser to anyone with sensitive skin who's looking for a gentle face cleanser. Very gentle. Works great for my Eczema prone infant This gentle facial cleanser is great for someone with sensitive skin. I have had very dry, sensitive skin and have dealt with eczema my whole life. I have not once found a facial cleanser that doesn't make me break out after a single use. This cleanser is very gentle on my skin and I have noticed a significant difference since using it for a few weeks. It especially helps me during the change in season when my skin tends to be most dry.It has a mild scent and doesn't smell unpleasant. With my sensitive skin, I cannot use anything with overpowering fragrance and alcohol. This, like dove soap, is very gentle and mild and great on the skin. I would definitely recommend this to a someone else needing a sensitive cleanser. This stuff is amazing! I got the idea from kathleen lights on youtube, she was raving about this on her products review. I have sensitive skin and this product really cleans my face without drying it out, and also removes my makeup also. This facial cleanser is one that my dermatologist recommended. It is great for sensitive skin, but my husband uses it too and his not-so-sensitive skin also appreciates it! If you have rosacea, give it a try. It is gentle and yet cleans well, and in my opinion, it is less drying than a Cetaphil cleanser which I also have used. I have used this product with myClarsonic and have gotten great results. Highly recommend!  I really like the Vanicream line of products. They are free of dyes, parabens, lanolin, formaldehyde, or gluten. They work well and leave your skin looking and feeling healthy. I've been using this product for a few weeks now and I'm liking it! My face is very sensitive, but Vanicream's Gentle Facial Cleanser (so far) is the best thing I've found. I'm also using Vanicream's cleansing bars (body soap) and their lite lotion for sensitive skin. I like the combination. Overall I'm loving Vanicream and am glad I made the switch. By far the best facial cleanser I have used (and I have tried a lot of them).  I tried this product after using their facial sunscreen and having very positive results.  If you have rosacea and are looking for something with a minimal amount of chemicals this could be the ticket.  Everyone's skin is different so it really is trial and error.  I like the CeraVe moisturizer and have been using it for years but for whatever reason I cannot tolerate their facial cleansers.  I have become a big fan of Vanicream and expect to be a long term customer (just hope they don't mess with whatever formula they are currently using because this cleanser and their facial sunscreen are the best I have used and by a significant margin). Very gentle.  A very good cleanser that I would have never tried if my dermatologist had not recommended. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I have started using this product four months ago, and will never use anything else now. My makeup melts away, it comes off completely and my face has never felt so clean from just soap and water. I have in the past tried face washes, and felt like my skin was being stripped of its natural oils and felt my skin tighten up afterwards. This product balances my skin out, I have combination skin so an oily t-zone and dry cheeks. I have no more dry cheeks and even my t-zone feels less greasy, I touch up my powder less now than I ever have before and can only think this is the reason. You will not be disappointed! Great for sensitive skin Very gentle on my sensitive skin and eyes. Doesn't make my allergies act up. So glad I found this. Gentle on my face but was able to wash away the make up .. Love it was able to use without any burning or irritations it is very gentle I have rosacea and sensitive adult acne prone skin. I have tried just about every face product out there. I have found using this vanicream gentle facial cleanser and vanicream moisturizing skin cream has been the best combination for getting my skin calmed down and clear.  This has been a great cleanser for me and I highly recommend it. I've used a lot of face washes that turned my face red and would dry it out. This face wash is the only one I have found that works on my sensitive face. This is very gentle, but the cleansing power is also excellent. It has no smell, so those who expect a fragrance might need to reconsider. Excellent product.  My dermatologist recommended it because I have sensitive skin.  It cleans and doesn't seem to age my skin at all great Never...never...never use soap on my face. This facial cleanser is gentle and doesn't take much to wash my face. I have used this for a long time and its a great gentle product. If you have sensitive skin give this a try. The best facial cleanser I have bought! It's soft and creamy feeling on the skin. No smell, no stinging, even when washing my eye lids. FYI the PH of the product is between 6 and 7, that's why it's so gentle for the eyes. I use it 2-3 times a day, and it's not drying or stripping at all. I have combo sensitive acne-prone rosacea skin, so I have to pretty much avoid using anything unnecessary. This cleanser is quite calming and balancing. It washes off easily and doesn't leave any residue on your skin to irritate or moisturize, so if your skin is very dry you still need to apply moisturizer. If you have oily acne prone skin and concerned about PH, simply use an acidic toner after washing. I make my own by mixing half water and half white vinegar. Wipe it on with a cotton round and it prevents any pimple from forming. I only moisturize my dry patches and do not use anything else on my oily zones. I do wear a mineral powder based sunscreen when going out during the day. When it comes to my skin, less is always more, and better. works really well and doesn't cause me allergies Use it because of my sensitive skin... Great product with no offensive fragrance. Dermatologist recommended. Works well Excellent product.  Works as expected. It feels so nice on my skin. My wife ask for it. A good product. Quick delivery and good product Received in days -very soothing to the skin It is very light and soothing. Delivered as stated. Excellent. THIS STUFF IS GOLD! I would totally recommend this cleanser if you are like me and cannot find a cleanser that is suitable for your sensitive, allergic-to-everything skin. I have hyper-sensitive skin (I am literally allergic to what seems like everything under the sun), eczema, and recently, hormonal acne (due to stopping birth control pills, I believe), and high stress caused by law school. My skin has been freaking out lately (and looking a hot mess), and nothing was seeming to work in improving my skin until I tried this. I have been using it for about a week, and I cannot remember the last time my skin looked and felt this great. In the past, I have tried countless cleaners that alleged to be for sensitive skin, were fragrance free, and free of irritants, from bar soaps, to foaming, to cream, and even oil cleansing, and nothing seemed to soothe my skin, let alone improve its appearance and feel. However, this cleanser has cleared up my acne, smoothed my skin, and completely decreased the itchiness/ irritation/ burning/ redness. In short, I AM SOLD. My morning routine is this, followed by Thayer's cucumber toner, and then just enough Vaseline for my face to not feel dry. I have very, very sensitive skin and eyes. I seem to be allergic to every skincare product I try. I was washing my face with olive oil because anything else caused a horrible reaction until my new dermatologist gave me some samples of Vanicream. Love it!!! Very gentle and takes off all my makeup with warm water and gentle scrubbing with a wash cloth. I am super pleased with the fast shipping!! Arrived on time just as promised and packed very well. I have very sensitive skin that with every change of the season has a rough time at adjusting to the dry-cool weather, and then warm, humid weather that Pittsburgh is blessed with every other day. My dermatologist is who originally turned me on to this product; I use the cleanser and the moisturizer. It is sensitive enough to use on my 6 year old son as well, but effective enough to wash off a face full of make up at the end of a long day. It does not over dry, yet it does not leave behind a film of residue. Love it. This is a staple in our home - I have sensitive skin and this works perfectly without drying. I purchased mine at Walgreens. I use this Vanicream cleanser in the shower to take off my makeup instead of using makeup wipes. Then I go in with my Clarisonic and use another pump of the Vanicream for some deep cleaning. It is great and doesn't leave any makeup residue. I use a toner after this as well and the cotton pad is clean. Great for acne prone skin. Doesn't break me out and doesn't dry my skin out! Love that it is fragrance free. I've been using this for a while now and I finally found something that is perfect after I oil cleanse or by itself when I'm not wearing makeup. I don't think this would ever take off all my makeup but I didn't expect it to. It does take off any excess makeup that my oil cleanser did not take off though. The packaging is nice and easy, it's simple. No bad smells, no bad ingredients. I love the way this feels on my skin. It's not drying and feels cooling and moisturizing to my dry sensitive skin. This is probably my favorite second step cleanser I've ever tried and trust me I've tried a lot. It also has lasted me so long. You don't need a lot of product, and you get a lot in the container. The price is affordable as well.Pros:Great for sensitive skinAffordableSimple and easy packagingHydrating/not dryingSoothingLittle goes a long wayA lot of productCons:Does not take off all makeupJust because it says it's for sensitive skin does not mean it will work for everyone My dermatologist recommended this product for a severe case of contact dermatitis on my face.  It worked extremely well to clear up the problem.  I also used the Shampoo, Moisture lotion and Sunscreen.  Since I am now prone to a another occurrence I will continue to use Vanicream.  I am happy with the vendors responsiveness.  I live in a small mountain town without a lot of options so my best bet is Amazon. Wonderful gentle cleanser. I wash my baby in this because it was recommended by my dermatologist. I was getting dermatitis on my lips & she suspected baby's infant shampoo which had a good amount of fragrance. This is a nice lightly foaming product, free of fragrance but pleasant smelling, gentle but actually feels like it cleans unlike some gentle cleansers. I use it on my face as well. My skin is so much better and my baby has beautiful skin! It's also completely tear free! My dermatologist recommended I use this to wash my face because I have mild rosacea. I had been using a hypoallergenic, no-fragrance soap, but this is so much better. It's much less drying and my face looks so much better. Great, basic facial cleanser. It doesn't leave my skin moisturized, but I don't feel that it strips my skin either. I do a double cleanse with it each night. The first removes my makeup, the second to cleanse my skin. It even removes my mascara and cream eyeshadow.  I don't wear a heavy foundation, so I can't attest to how well it would remove that. It does remove my mineral powder foundation and the rest of my makeup beautifully. I keep one in the shower for the morning and one at the sink for evenings. You can't beat the quality for the price.  It isn't loaded with a lot of junk thats bad for the skin and gets the job done. What more could you want? I have purchased 4 bottles. Very impressed with this product. It is very gentle and leaves my face feeling clean. It doesn't dry my face out or cause any additional problems, it is just simply a gentle face wash. I have dry and sensitive skin and I am able to use it twice a day with great results. Wonderful product that has helped my sensitive, reactive skin return to a heathy state. I am a Trentinoin user so my skin is also very sensitive to cleansers--and this product has no tingling sensation at all. It cleans very well. I use grape seed oil to remove sunscreen and immediately come in with this cleanser and it washes it away gently leaving no greedy reside behind--only soft hydrated skin. I love this vanicream facial cleanser it goes on light and has a lot of suds for small amount. My dermatologists and esthetician gave me somesamples to try and I like it. I also bought the vanicream spf 50 sun screen that I try as a sample.The cleanser is so soft takes off makeup and is oil free, sulfate free, soap free. I let my mom try it and I'm waiting to get it back from her.  I would recommend it to a friend this is one of my new favorites. I really like this face wash!  I have combination skin and have dealt with problematic skin for as long as I can remember.  I've tried so many different types of cleaners, and after now using this for the past few weeks I can say that I think I've finally found something that works.  It's very effective at removing my makeup and does not cause any irritation.  It doesn't leave my skin feeling tight and dry and it creates a nice, light foam when you start to work it in.  Highly recommend! Between this cleanser and the Vanicream moisturizing cream, i don't think there is anything better for sensitive skin. The improvement is remarkable. Wish I had started using them decades ago. I wear a lot of make-up and it cleans it up real good with only one pump's worth of cleanser. It creates a lot of suds and my skin feels super clean, and is not irritated at all. best ever. i bought the whole line face and hair products and a lot of my issues have gone away. all the natural stuff gave me a dirty filmy feeling and i broke out horribly. i dont know what im allergic to and when i read the reviews it sounded like a bunch of people with conditions that used drugs so not really in that group of people but anyhow ive tried everything and i gave this a shot. everyone notices how nice my skin looks even the behind the ear pimples are healing lol Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser for sensitive skin with pump dispenser - dye free, fragrance free, preservative free - oil free and non comedogenic - dermatologist tested - 8 ounceMy dermatologist recommended I try Vanicream Gentle Cleanser instead of soap with Salicylic Acid acne treatment to remove my make-up at night. I always thought a ""gentle"" cleanser wouldn't work with my acne-prone skin - so I was skeptical! (When I think gentle- I think weak) However, I've used this for almost a month and can't believe how well it removes my make-up, and how deep it really cleans! I've been over treating and drying out my skin for years. From now on I'm using Vanicream to really clean my face! Was trying to replace the unreplacable (philosophy purity) but I'm pretty pleased actually. It has little to no scent, is very creamy and removed make up well I have been using this cleanser for one month with a battery operated facial brush .  I wet my face and use one quick pump of this from the jar , then smear it on four head , cheeks and chin . It is a nice light soap with absolutely no odor that rinses off very easily .  If you leave too much water on the facial brush it will work up a foam that flies off  while using it.  I have only used this soap with the battery operated brush and I really , really like it .  It is a wonderful gentle facial soap that I would recommend . I've been using the gentle facial cleanser for a year now because my skin is sensitive to fragrances and I don't like using products with parabens.  I also use the lite lotion on my face daily and have never had a rash or acne break out EVER. I occasionally use the Vanicream  moisturizing skin cream in the winter because it is much thicker than the lite cream which helps protect my skin, especially my face  from the harsh drying winter winds. I will be trying the SPF 30 lotion next but am hesitant using any product with SPF because every single one I've tried has given me a rash. Only one way to find out if this one is different ; ). This was recommended to me as a solution for dry & sensitive skin. Most facial cleansing products are too harsh and leave my skin irritated and dry, but this is very gentle and not overdrying at all. It's also an effective cleanser, I use a witch hazel toner after cleansing and very minimal makeup ends up on the cotton pad. I will definitely be repurchasing this. Love this to clean my face. No left behind dryness on skin. Infact now I am buying Vanicream for 3 people!! So glad the skin specialist recommended this. I have the unfortunate pleasure to have ridiculously sensitive skin; some of my battles include acne, mild rosacea, allergic reactions to a host of ingredients, eczema, etc.  This product is my absolute favorite in the Vanicream line of products (which I now use religiously).  It cleanses my skin without drying, washes off cleanly, and most importantly, doesn't cause any adverse effects on my skin.  In fact, my skin feels moisturized, balanced, and natural.  I ran across the Vanicream/Free and Clear line by accident and am incredibly grateful it came up.  I'm pushing 35 and my skin has truly never looked better!  I pair this face wash with the lite lotion daily, and have for over a year.  Seriously, I will never try another face wash again.  This is it. Last year I had a terrible allergic facial incident. I call it that, because I still don't know what it was. It lasted almost an entire year, and Vanicream was the only one which didn't make things worse. On advice from my dermatologist, I used the facial cleanser, the lite lotion, and the heavier lotion. I can't say how much I appreciate the product. Have sensitive skin and eye problems so finding a cleanser that works well without irritation to my skin or eyes can be a challenge.  This cleanser is great, feels creamy when using it, foams a bit on contact and washes off easily.  I have had no eye or skin problems using this and will more than likely make this a permanent item in my skin regimen. I have to use products that are 100% fragrance free or I get flu like symptoms within seconds.  I bought a $30 facial cleanser by another brand, and I prefer the creaminess and consistency of the Vanicream more! Plus, it cleans my face well!  Lesson learned!  It's a superb value. I'll definitely reorder. I haven't purchased a facial cleanser in a long time because I had stocked up on a product that my skin could tolerate. My Dermatologist recommended Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser. It works very well for my sensitive skin; even better than the previous cleanser I was using at a higher price. The cost is worth it. When you have sensitive skin or allergies to chemicals and fragrance it can be frustrating to find a safe and effective product. Fear not; this facial cleanser is the perfect one for you! This cleanser is free of dyes, parabens, lanolin, fragrance, masking fragrance, oils, formaldehyde, amines, gluten, sodium lauryl sulfate and soap; so, you can be sure those harsh chemicals that should not be on your face, stay off your face. Whether you are looking for a cleanser to clear acne, wash away the day’s makeup, or simply leave you feeling refreshed, this cleanser will not disappoint. I only recently learned of my allergy to fragrance and I was concerned I would not be able to find a product that could so easily replace my existing cleanser, but this cleanser has proved to rank above all others in quality, smell, and usability.QUALITYThis facial cleanser sells for $8.99 for an 8-ounce bottle, which is a little more expensive than comparable products, but is worth the couple extra dollars for the quality of the product. Vanicream facial cleanser is gentle and effective, and does not dry out the skin; therefore, you can be confident that it is safe for everyday use. Vanicream offers you the most “bang for your buck”; a little goes a long way, so even though this bottle may be slighter smaller than average, it will last you a long time. I have used this cleanser twice a day, every day for three weeks and still have three-fourths of the bottle remaining.Vanicream facial cleanser offers a degree of quality that is hard to find elsewhere in a cleanser, so I would recommend this product even to those who are not chemical or skin sensitive!SMELLThis product is advertised as fragrance-free, but it does have a soft scent to it; Vanicream facial cleanser smells clean, similar to baby powder. However, you can rest easy knowing that this facial cleanser does not get its scent from harsh, flower and fruit scented chemicals, that could potentially irritate your eyes and skin.USABILITYPerhaps the most important feature of Vanicream facial cleanser is that it is easy and convenient to use. The 8-ounce bottle is outfitted with a pump that never seems to get clogged or “gunked up.” Washing your face with Vanicream facial cleanser is a simple step process, unlike some other fragrance-free lines. It works best to wet your hands and face with warm water beforehand, and then lather the product in your hands before applying to your face. Once applied, it is easy to rinse the product off with warm water once again; this process will leave you and your face feeling clean and refreshed.The product is not too goopy and it transforms into the perfect foamy consistency.This is the perfect product to help you wash away the dirt of the day in the evening AND to help you wake up in the morning. I would recommend this product to absolutely anyone seeking an alternative to chemical-laden facial cleansers, and this is a MUST HAVE for anyone with a skin sensitivity or chemical allergy. Vanicream beats their competition by providing a high-quality, easy-to-use, and delightfully light scented product. Buy this facial cleanser today and you will not regret it! I use this all the time. It is a wonderful product and keeps my skin clean and smooth. Since I have sensitive skin, this was one of the products recommended to me by my dermatologist and it works. No irritation! I have been searching for a good facial cleanser which doesn't irritate my skin.I used olay, neutrogena, cetaphil, clean&clear, cerave, loreal, yes,aveeno and etc, but unfortunately, all disappointed me.although vanicream facial cleanser is slightly more expensive than other brand ones, but I think this product is completely worth every penny.I started to notice and feel difference after using this cleanser, my face no longer feels like i am experiencing drought on my face.but, also it doesn't make my face feel greasy,either. I have a teenage boy who currently is battling with acne, and even I see difference this facial cleanser makes for my son as well. when you use this, you don't need two or three pumps, just one little pump is very enough.At first, I pumped two or three times as usual, but I noticed that this product little amount goes a long way. I have pretty sensitive skin, and I am also acne prone. most cleansers made for sensitive skin have burned my face, while other cleansers hve made me break out.  Neutrogena creamy formula, cetaphil, and even some high end brands like Avene and la-roch posay, have all burned my skin regardless of how small the list of ingredients are. Burt's bees, ponds, and just about every other creamy- type  ""sensitive skin"" cleanser has made me break out. I resorted to oil cleansing, which made my thin hair really oily the next day. Enter Vanicream: I really love this cleanser. I see and feel a noticeable difference in my skin- without the burning- and I have only used it for two days. It's one of the best cleansers out there for under 10 bucks. And the water soluble  formula is a bonus for my hair. Just grateful I found this and had the courage to try it!  Good products are rare these days! This cleanser is so gentle and doesn't over dry the skin which is exactly what I've been looking for since I have very dry skin. It feels so smooth going on and a little goes a long way. And I love the fact that I'm not putting harmful ingredients on my face because of how natural this cleaner is. Highly recommend! I love the facial cleanser but I do have a complaint about the packaging.  I have had two bottles now where I haven't been able to get the pump to work.  Thank goodness I hadn't disposed of the used container yet so I just switch the old pump to the new bottle.  I gave a bottle to a friend and her bottle was one that didn't work.  Sadly I didn't have another spare pump to give her.  I'm hoping she still loves the product as much as I do! This came recommended by my dermatologist, with samples. I have aquagenic urticaria solar urticaria idiopatic urticaria and lupus, so my skin is very sensitive. I was very pleased with this cleanser and plan to buy the lite lotion and the shampoo and conditioner as well. Highly recommend. Very soothing for sensitive skin. My dermatologist recommended Aveeno sensitive cleanser. It worked pretty good, but I like Vanicream better. It cleanses my skin thoroughly without leaving it feeling dry. When you have Rosacea it's hard to find a product that cleans well, yet is gentle. I also love their light lotion. Î have extremely sensitive skin. Most facial cleansers make my face feel itchy (including cetaphil and cerave) but this removes all of my makeup with ease and gives me no itching sensation or irritation. I also have small patches of eczema on my face near my eyes and other facial cleansers I’ve used in the past cause flare ups and the eczema would never go away- my facial eczema has disappeared since I started using Vanicream. I can’t recommend this product enough! Excellent cleaning product for makeup.  Great for sensitive skin and cleans better than expensive department store brands.  This is a no soap product which works. My dermatologist gave me samples of some vanicream lotion and I liked it so well that I bought some on Amazon. Then I saw this facial cleanser and I just had to try it also. I have dry skin and this helps a lot. It does not foam up like most other cleansers and makes my face feel soft and smooth. Not drying like most cleansers I'm allergic to a lot of ingredients in beauty products. This is one of the few products that is safe for me. It's a bonus that it makes my face feel clean without drying it out. I'd recommend this product to everyone! Very happy with the Vanicream products.  I have super sensitive skin and their products work great. There are not enough stars for this product, as it has brought a state of calm to some very irritated skin. Lightweight skin cleanser. I have super sensitive skin and no breakouts from this! I'm also allergic to many scents, but this one has a light scent, not overpowering, so it's ok for me. Give it a try : ) My face is EXTREMELY sensitive.  Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser is perfect!  Makes a nice foam and rinses off easily.  Although it doesn't leave a drying effect, I still use moisturizer. I haven’t stopped using this cleanser since I got my first bottle. It doesn’t dry my skin, and cleanses it throughly. I don’t even use a makeup remover, and removes my non-waterproof mascara and foundation. This facial cleanser is great. It removes all of my makeup and leaves my skin feeling very clean. I especially like using it with my cleansing brush. I appreciate the fact that it does not have an overpowering scent and is great for my sensitive skin. My skin does not feel dry after using it too. Great for people who allergic to Methylisothiazolinone . This is the BEST facial cleanser for those of us suffering from severe eczema. Just wash your face 1-2 times a day (definitely before bed) and follow up with Eucerin Original Moisturizing Lotion Eucerin Original Healing Lotion 16.90 Oz. I have sensitive, dry skin.  For years I only used baby bath but now even those are irritating to my skin and eyes.  I love Cerave and Cetaphil cleansers and will likely always keep those on hand for body but they do not adequately remove my makeup.  So I tried this since  I already love it he Vanicream lotion and cream and WOW!  This stuff is amazing.It takes very little for a good, thorough cleansing of the face including eyes made up with liner, shadow and lots of mascara.  Makes a gentle foam and rinses clean.  I can tell by the cotton pad toner application just how clean my face is.  With the others, I needed an eye makeup remover before cleansing and still many swipes of toner before the pad was free of makeup.And BTW, quite a bargain.  So happy. I have very sensitive skin.  It's hard to find lotion that doesn't irritate my skin.  This product has been great.  I use it on my face everyday and haven't had any problems with irritation. I highly recommend it. This product works really well for me.  I need a mild cleanser for my hands for skin issues due to work and this product seems to do the trick.It is a vegan product  - Animal testing free, animal content free,  animal cruelty free.^^^^ That was the ultimate decision maker for me in choosing this product ^^^^ Recommended by my dermatologist.  It's fine, but I don't think there's really any difference between this product line and Cetaphil products. My dermatologist suggested the vanicream soaps as I was suffering from bad eczema flare ups. Finally have my flare ups under control and confident that these soaps helped! I love this facial cleanser!! My skin got extremely sensitive and this is the only brand that works for me. Love love love I can't begin to count the number of facial cleansers I've tried, particularly those that are paraben free, including many that have been extremely pricey.  I've gone back to Vanicream and don't think I'll deviate from it again.  It's creamy and takes off make-up with little effort.  My skin looks and feels great after cleansing and I've never had any type of negative reaction from this product.  I kick myself thinking of all the expensive products I've tried when this one works better than them all. Not too drying, but still manages to remove makeup and sebum. Works great as a gentle cleanser to use with my retinoid. This did not irritate my skin like another much more expensive organic I was using. I highly recommend if you have sensitive skin or allergies like myself. This was recommended by my allergist after an allergic reaction to another facial product. My face is sensitive to everything, and I have had a problem finding a facewash that doesn't dry my face out or cause a rash. This is working well so far. I love this! i have rosacea and i needed a product such as this. It was recommended to me by my allergist. Super gentle yet effective. I have oily skin and I use this to wash my face every morning before I do my makeup. Doesn't strip anything or make my skin feel dry, but rinses away the oil. I love it. I don’t have eczema, but my skin is relatively sensitive and breaks out easily. I got this after my dermatologist recommended it about six months ago and haven’t looked back. I’ve tried cleansers from EVERYwhere (plus dozens of samples through Birchbox) and my face has never responded so well to a cleanser. A little goes a long way, so I’m only on my second bottle. I can’t believe how affordable it is and how soft it makes my skin without all the crazy chemicals and dyes. Highly recommend. Light cleanser, with lots of lather. A little goes a long way. NO Sent at all.The least amount of ingredients in a face product I’ve ever seen! Love the gentleness non drying formula they use. Just leaves my fave feeling clean. A nice gentle cleanser that doesn't irritate or break you out. Other cleansers burn under my eyes or make my skin red and this doesn't. Foams up nicely and washes off my face makeup, but I do need to remove my eye makeup separately. Love this cleanser, makes you feel clean with no residue. It doesn't dry you out and the pump is great to use in the shower. Wonderful cleanser and really ideal for people with sensitive skin.  This is all I use. My baby has seborrheic dermatitis and I was looking for a product to wash her body with no oils or SLS... This product is a winner... Doesn't dry out or irritate her skin... I wish they would make a body wash version!!! I use this line as I am highly allergic to fragrance and my dermatologist recommended it. It removes makeup, dirt and grime and leaves my skin soft and smooth. If you are looking for a fragrance-free cleanser, I recommend this product! One of the very few things that doesn't irritate my ridiculously sensitive skin. Cleans without stripping my skin dry. Very happy. A useful skin treatment for dry atmospheres. Can be applied after shaving, and at night. My skin keeps getting more sensitive with age. Finding this face wash has been a blessing, no more burning sensation when I wash. Now to find a lotion as good. Good product! Very mild and effective facial cleanser. Great for my sensitive skin. Love this product recommend by a couple of dermatologist, made by the Mayo Clinic. Comes in bar form also which is easier for travel. Nice, cleans without drying or residue. No perfumes either. You get a lot of product for the money, I have sensitive, dry, and fair skin and don't care for how a lot of face washes make my skin feel. This one works wonderfully and is excellent at removing eye makeup without stinging my eyes. Good neutral cleaner, This removes my tinted sunscreen and Eye brow make=up.  It doesn't leave my skin greasy or dry.  I cannot use soaps of any kind.  I can't wear even hypo-allergenic products.  Tis is gentle and really cleans. Recommended by my dermatologist. Good product I use this every day and love it. It does not dry my skin at all, feels clean when finished.  One of Vanicream's best products!Definitely recommend. My dermatologist recommended this product. I have rosacea and perorial dermatitis on my face. Since I started using this product my face has improved 100%! My face is no longer inflamed with so much redness! I highly recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin. Also works for oily skin. This is exactly like the product I've purchased through my pharmacy - highly recommend!  Have been using this product for over one year due to skin allergies, and love it!  Moisturizes without feeling greasy. Liked the ingredients so I gave it a try. My face has never been so clear. I use it with Givenchy moisturizer. I wish I would have known years ago that something gentle is so much better for my acne than the harsh “acne cleansers.” And I swear since I have been using this, my eyelashes and eyebrows have been fuller/longer. I know it sounds crazy. Lol. But just an observation! I acquired post menopausal sensitive skin. Oh joy.  I have allergies to most eye makeup now and just fussy skin.  This cleanser is not irritating at all.  It's also creamy, non drying (although I still have pretty oily skin), lathers nicely and is virtually fragrance free.  A great find!! doesn't dry out your face This is the best face cleaner I ever had.  Removes all makeup but is gentle on your skin. Great cleanser to remove oil from skin while preventing drought issue. Light-weight, non-irritating for sensitive skin. I've been using this for a few years now, and have had no red areas, no itchy facial skin, and my skin feels hydrated, not greasy. I don't know what it will do long-term for wrinkles."
B01MSBL7L1," good I have noticed a big difference in the texture of my dry skin. I am 68 and I love this moisturizer. Everyone has noticed how smooth my skin is and how it is glowing. I want to buy it again. I can't understand the bad reviews. I do use it in the morning and the evening. I noticed some aren't doing that, but I am. It has no harsh ingredients. Simply love it. Love the produce can start to see differences in my skin it soaks in my skin well. But I only use it once a week. Didn't notice any improvement. Love the clean feel it leaves on my face! as everything I have used its great So far this product feels great. Glad it is NOT ""auto-ship"", otherwise I wouldn't purchase it! Good stuff wonderful allergic"
B01MDQM11L," This face wash helps to prevent my face from breaking out. I have sensitive combination skin that easily breaks out. This face wash doesn't dry out my face like most others do. I find that drying face washes can make my breakouts even worse.Edit: I've been using this face wash for four months now and it has helped to completely get rid of breakouts. I haven't had any major breakouts in weeks, which is great. This definitely feels like a face wash that helps to balance the pH of your skin without stripping your skin's moisture barrier. It also does a really great job at removing waterproof makeup. Nice gentle facial wash. I really like this SkinActive line everything I have tried has been gentle, nice, and moisturizing. This stuff is great. It feels light on my skin and doesn't cause any skin irritation. Love this gentle cleanser, gets all the makeup off. A gift. She loves it ! Clean, gentle, thorough without the bad stuff. No scent either, which is good because some scented face washes make me sneeze. Oh, and it's very affordable! I am going to stick with this! I was looking for a sulfate-free face wash that actually got my face clean, and this is it! I wear makeup daily, and haven't had to take additional steps to remove my makeup before washing my face. this stuff is amazing - doesn't dry out my face at all as most do. highly recommended It is very gentle on skin, as it says. 😍 I've been on the hunt for YEARS for the perfect cleanser.  I am the type of gal who prefers things be ""one and done"" and I like to keep my beauty regimen as basic as possible.  Over the weekend, my old ""stand in"" (Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser if anyone is interested), that quite frankly was not getting the job done, and had been drying my face out, and irritating the heck out of my face, ran out.  When I got to the store, I was in a hurry, so I grabbed this on the fly.  The price tag was a bit steep compared to some, but I liked that the bottle contained about 2x the amount of other cleansers, with the promise of gentleness.  After 3 days, here's what I can tell you about this product so far:1.  It cleans, and CLEANS GOOD without drying my face, or irritating me at all, every spec of eye makeup, mascara, eyeliner, EVERYTHING without needing to use anything else.2.  A little dab will do you; I had concerns with a large bottle, that it'd likely require several pumps worth to foam up enough to do the job, nope.3.  It is truly unscented, with the mild smell of the components of course, but no perfumes or dyes added.4.  I haven't needed a moisturizer, that's how gentle this cleanser is...it leaves the good natural oils on my face, but removes the bad.5.  The breakouts I had last week are gone!  My skin is glowing, and feels soft.This bottle is going to last me a good long while.  I really love it, and I hope that Garnier does not discontinue or replace this with another product.  This is a much better value, and works far better than CereVe and Cetaphil have for me.  5 stars! First let me start by saying I hate washing my face. I have just never enjoyed splashing water on my face in the morning or at night. But I know I can't live on Garnier Miceller water alone forever lol. I had been eyeing this bottle for a while at my local store and finally couldn't hold off on skincare anymore and this cleanser on Amazon with a $2 off coupon so I got it for under $7!! I used to use CeraVe ( which is an ounce last and still lasted me forever) but it's pretty pricey for drugstore cleanser. I don't need my cleanser to do much just: not leave my skin sqeeky ""too clean"" & strip me of natural oils, but still clean my face and hydrate what most cleansers tend to take away from skin. Maybe that is kind of a lot LOL. I'm a bit combo skin. (If that helps anyone.) Either way this stuff is amazing and you NEED it in your skin care regimen! Even in my makeup seems to go on better. It's creamy, not oily, not drying, the PERFECT clean. Who knew you could love a cleanser or so much?! Well done Garnier!! Garnier SkinActive cleanser is so awesome and satisfying. I was afraid this would be like Cetaphil, which is so weak and practically useless to fully clean my face/remove cosmetics. This product gives a rich lather with just a pump of cleanser and cleaned all the makeup off my face. The smell was super-mild, like ingredients and not fragrance. The result was that my combination skin was very clean, makeup-free and not overly dried out at all.This is a big container, 13.5 ounces, so much bigger than most facial washes. I'm quite pleased with the quality and performance of this cleanser and would definitely seek it out in the future. I recommend. I chose to try out this Garnier product because I think I've become sensitive, allergic even, to products that contain sulfate.  I've already freed my hair and scalp from sulfates by using the appropriate shampoo.  Now I'm looking for something that would make a good hand and face cleanser.When I began using this gentle cleaner as a handwash I was getting a rash on my fingers.  I'm pretty sure this was a result of the liquid dish detergent I use to wash 'those special dishes and dishware'.  You know, the ones you don't want to place in the dishwasher.  After using the Garnier SkinActive cleaners for 10 days my hands had almost completely recovered.  So this cleanser is gentle and non irritating for me.As a face wash I've found it to be gentle.  However, it's not terribly good at removing my more stubborn makeup.  However I really like it for ingredients it lacks, and it's non irritating properties.  The Add-On price, as I write this, is reasonable to me. This cleanser works so perfectly for my skin, I'm telling everyone I know! It is so gentle on my extra sensitive and prone to redness skin. I love how refreshing it feels when you've washed it away. It feels like your pores are singing. It's simply THE best cleanser I've ever used and I previously thought Rodan & Fields was! This tops it and makes R&F look  cheap and gimmicky. I am not sponsored to write this, I actually bought it at my local Ulta after talking to an employee there about my skin issues and she recommended this, the dry skin gel (omg amazing!) and the sensitive skin make up wipes. Everything I've bought so far has exceeded my expectations and made me a ""Garnier junkee"" bc I'm on here looking to buy more products! LOVE LOVE LOVE this cleanser. If you're on the fence about buying it, DO IT! I have oily sensitive skin and I tend to break out easily with many facial cleansers. I’ve tried (Murad, Peter Thomas Roth, Clinique, Neutrogena.. ) unfortunately the list goes on and on. It’s so frustrating searching for a cleanser that doesn’t break me out. I was honestly at a loss when I stumbled upon this. I decided to try this and I’m so happy I did! I’ve been using it for about two months now and haven’t any breakouts or tightness with my skin like most have left me. There’s not really a smell to it, if anything it’s very light and clean. The consistency of it lathers well too. It effectively removes my makeup as well which an extra bonus! I’ve finally found my favorite cleanser. Please don’t discontinue this! I have fairly sensitive skin that has been especially dry this winter. My usual cleanser has been seemingly making my skin even more dry -- which is where this Garnier cleanser comes in. It is so gentle, yet somehow gets my face feeling completely clean. The smell is fresh but not overpowering or artificial, and the texture is almost gel like. It isn't drying at all...in fact, it's actually pretty hydrating. My skin looks glowy and clear after using this. A great cleanser -- especially for the price. Added bonus is that this is sulfate free. I will be repurchasing! Excellent for sensitive skin. I suffer from Lupus so it's hard for me to wash my face when I have a flare up, but I can use this face wash because it is very gentle on the face. It has a light scent it works very good at removing oil and makeup. I don't know how I received three it was ordered as a add on item but I love the product so good for me. I am a ""senior citizen"" (sigh) and have a hard time finding cleansers that don't dry my face out. I was pleasantly surprised that this Garnier product was as gentle on my skin as they advertise, and it did not leave my face feeling overly dry. Whether you use your hands or a face cloth, a small amount is all it takes to create a nice amount of gentle cleansing foam. It does not have a heavy perfumed or heavy alcohol smell to it, which is nice compared to other products I've used. I do not wear make-up, so I can't attest to how it works on that front. But as a gentle, non-drying facial cleanser, I highly recommend. I'm really surprised and impressed by both the quality and price of this cleanser. For over 13 oz and at a drugstore price, this cleanser cleans my face much better than most of the high-end brands I've tried. It's very gentle but leaves my skin feeling completely clean and refreshed. I only needed two small pumps to work up a really nice lather, so I expect this bottle to last a really long time. Gently cleans. I have sensitive skin and this works great for me. Lot less breakouts. I've always used this favorite french honey scented face wash of mine, but this is very cleansing. Nice consistency, really sticks to the face. Almost like a gel mask after you dampen your face. I use a facial brush to activate it in the shower and it works very well! It does smell slightly ""clinical"" like it'd be best used in a hospital but as far as cleaning goes, it delivers. So I'd chalk that up as a positive! I only use 2-3 pumps and it's great. Soft results, won't be disappointed whatsoever I can tell you. I love this cleanser, it's great!!! It leaves my face feeling light and perfectly clean and fresh. This is a wonderful product and I hope they don't discontinue it. My oily skin loves this, it has reduced my breakouts significantly. You don't need a large amount to wash in either, a little dab will do you. I am so impressed with this face wash. I have very sensitive skin, and most products cause me to break out in hives on my face (eww). This product foams up nicely and cleans your face and does not leave any residue. Didn't leave my face feeling tight after using it. Will update review after prolong use, stay tuned! I love this face wash. It leaves my skin clean and smooth. It's not squeaky clean. It's a comfortable clean. It gets rid of all of my makeup and my skin has seen a major improvement since I started using this. I used to use Origins and I think this is a superior product! This is very gentle cleanser. I like to use this on days when I need to wash my face more frequently (exercise, working outside, etc.).  It does not strip my skin but cleans it.  There really is not a scent in this – just smells like “soap” or nothing.  I think it would also be good for body cleansing if you have really sensitive skin.  This comes in a nice big pump bottle so is easy to use in the shower. This has been cleaning my skin very well. I don't use it quite every day, because I'm finding it a bit too drying on my skin for that, but the general condition of my skin has definitely improved over a couple of weeks of using it and I'm hoping to see the trend continue. The soap is nice and thick and goes on nicely, and based on my usage rate thus far the bottle's going to last a decent amount of time. Very gentle cleanser, great for sensitive skin. I'm not big on fruity or flower scented soap and no fancy fragrance here, does have a slight smell of just plain soap. Product is thin enough to freely flow through the pump, do not see it clogging up like some of our other soaps. We keep ours in the shower, and a penny sized amount leaves your skin feeling refreshed and smooth, also does a great job or removing my wife's makeup. Great product would recommend for sensitive skin. This did a great job of removing my facial makeup. My skin felt so clean soft and refreshed after I was finished. it wasnt syper dried out and it smelled nice. I really enjoyed using this product and will be reccomending it to my sister and some friends. Thank you Influenster for this amazing oppertunity to review this for free. I am absolutely loving this cleanser. I don't have incredibly sensitive skin but sometimes I get dried out easily and this cleanser has been perfect for me. I've used it lately as the second part of double cleansing and its worked out great for me. Highly recommended! I love this face wash. Often after using drugstore washes my face feels tight and dry. Since the second ingredient in this is glycerine, and there are no soaps, this does not make my face feel this way. This is a perfect wash for winter months when you're dried out anyway. The glycerine is a great moisturizer and my skin does not react at all to it.This has a fresh, clean scent and you only need about half a pump to cover your whole face. This Garnier cleanser is nice and gentle on your skin.  It does work up some suds and I have used this on its own and also with my Clarisonic.  It works great either way and removes all makeup.  There is no scent either.  It's nice that it is sulfate free but that would not be a game changer for me.  I will be buying this in the future! This is a oily prone skin type of girl talking. I have gone through many expensive different cleansers and products and I am sticking with this one. It has worked same as my last cleanser I had for prone oily skin (la Roche) with the difference it doesn't have sulfates that cause that horrible excessive dry looking on your face. N my face feels super clean. I have a sulfate sensitivity and just purchased this wash. I used it for the first time last night and was very pleased. My skin isn't dry or itchy. Best I’ve found in years of searching! Non-soap, but still not a slimey “no lather” feel! Lathers decently and leaves no film; not at all drying but takes off every trace of makeup and yuck! Very well priced, too. This worked Brest on my sensitive skin. I don't wear a ton of makeup but this removed my mascara and other stuff easily. I just wet my face, squirt some into my hands with a bit of water and cleaned my face ina circular motion. It left my skin feeling clean and not dry or anything. Very gentle, but at the same time, foams up well and cleans without drying out.  This does not irritate of dry out my skin, but it leaves it feeling soft and silky smooth, but not greasy.  You can use it on your face as well as on your body.  I really like it! I was really surprised at how well this cleanser took all my makeup off. I usually oil cleanse and then wash but I ran out of oil. Didn't even need it! Leaves your face soft and clean. The consistency is like Cetaphil if it foamed. This is a gentle high performing face wash.  The pump makes it perfect for the shower.  It is light and refreshing without the use of sulfate.  I used it at night and woke up the following morning without a tight skin feel.  My skin felt clean and refreshed! Good stuff. I like the pump bottle, makes things easy. Not harsh or fragrant. Face feels clean. good Love this! Just as good as my holy grail CeraVe wash for dry skin, just a little cheaper. I use it every morning without fail. So good. I have oily skin and i use a pea sized amount. I use this every morning and night before i go to bed. If improved my skin so I like this. I would reccomend this to anyone to try because it is for all skin types and it is safe to use. I bought this in person so my review is not a verified purchase. I love this stuff! I bought extra bottles for fear they'll discontinue the product.  I have my whole family using it. My hairdresser even said how great my skin looked. This is truly sulfate free and it is not irritating on my sensitive skin. I have paid a lot more for a facial cleanser than what i paid for this and they were not as gentle as advertised. I would recommend this product to anyone. Really love this product, it does give clean, no tightest feeling after wash.It's a hard to find product in the physical stores. Good product for all skin types. Great Cleanser! Especially during the winter season. I get so dry from other cleansers but not this one. No dryness and face feels clean. Definite repurchase."
B073T4P56P," I love how this makes my boyfriend's face be shine free all day. He used to get oil patches even after a few hours after washing his face but not anymore thanks to the gel face wash. Has a nice scent that doesn't linger on the face either. If I had a nickel for all the face products I have tried...start with these and you will not need to look any farther.  Visible results after just a week of use.  I cannot recommend highly enough! I get dandruff in my eyebrows, beard and mustache. My face gets so dry especially since Ive moved to Texas with hard water and dryer air (not as humid as Ohio). Other products with sulfate and other chemicals seem to just make my problem worse. Im on day 3 of using these as directed and my skin is firm, smooth and healthy. No more dry skin! So happy I tried this. I now want to try the shampoo and conditioner. I definitely recommend this product! I bought all three of these items individually at one point or another for my husband and he loves them! This is a great kit with all three. I have to admit that I use the face scrub too- its my absolute favorite Brickell product. It leaves your face feeling so clean and refreshed. I haven't found another all natural scrub that leaves that really exfoliates. I also love the pepperminty tingle it gives my skin :) I had to buy two of the face washes because I love using them so much that I was afraid I would run out. It's been over 2 months that I bought this package, and all 3 things STILL have product left. Granted, the face wash is the lowest, but I am surprised it lasted this long, seeing as I use it nearly 3 times a day. I used to NEVER use moisturizer and looking back, I don't know how I went that long without it. My skin used to be dry, would occasionally flake, and lacked any sort of health. Now, I cannot leave the house without having put this moisturizer on. It makes my face feel great and hydrated. The face wash has a great scent to it, suds up well, and with only a small amount, covers your entire face in enough soap that you feel it actually did something. I cannot stand products that make no suds or anything. The face scrub I tend to not use so much, but the times that I have, it feels good too. Do your face a favor, and get this. A healthy face radiates confidence and cleanliness. I recently made the switch from Kiehl's and Clinique products to Brickell after trying the sample pack from the website. The face soap made my face feel a lot cleaner than the other 2. It foamed more and after rinsing skin was nice and soft. The face scrub is gentle but you can definitely feel the difference after. Finally the lotion. A little goes a long way and leaves the skin feeling nice and smooth. The scent is an added bonus. I love the minty scent and my wife loves it as well. This is my new go to skincare brand. I have tried several men's product lines and I think I have finally found one that works. The products have a nice scent and are not overbearing. The face scrub has a gel like consistency that I wasn't expecting but seems to work quite well. I like that the products are not full of chemicals that seem to over dry and irritate my skin. I have been using them for about two weeks and have no complains."
B01LTAPN88," 2 uses so far so good leaves skin feeling nourished. goes on smooth take away small pimples tooused 2x Excellent product Very good. Cant wait to order more from this product line Great Item!!! I have heard about the wonders of dead sea mud masks but was always wary. If something sounds too good to be true it probably is. I have combination skin so it is always a challenge to find a product that works well with my face. My skin is also super sensitive and I easily get rashes and red skin if I am not careful. This mask was buttery smooth and felt like heaven. When I removed the mask, my face wasn't red! A miracle. Plus my skin felt smooth and clean. This product is wonderful if you want a gentle, deep cleaning mask. Came in a sealed bubble wrap package, canister itself was plastic sealed and had a seal on the inside of lid as well...as for the mask itself, it felt great on, had that light cool effect like it was cleaning things out, and afterward my skin felt super soft and clean. Very happy, will buy more when I run out! I like that this Sky Organics Dead Sea Mud Mask comes safely wrapped in bubble wrap with a product wrapper over that. There is a cellophane tamper-proof seal in place, covering the entire bottle and lid, ensuring that the product I received was tamper-free, which gives me peace of mind and is, to me, a huge part of my satisfaction with a product. I love that this is 100% Natural and Organic. This Mask is thick, rich, and creamy to apply. I appreciate very much that the expiration date is clearly marked on the bottom of the jar and that there is plenty of time to use this product. The label contains all the pertinent information, such as product information, directions, ingredients, seals earned, and company contact information, all at my fingertips.To use, I make sure my face is clean. Then I hold a very warm, wet washcloth on my face to open my pores. I hold it in place for a few minutes, which is easy to do, as it feels wonderful. I then apply a generous coat of this mask to my face and neck, leave on for 20 minutes, give or take, depending on what I'm doing, after which I get the washcloth wet again with nice warm water, hold the washcloth on my face to dampen the Dead Sea Mud Mask, then gently wipe it away, rinsing the washcloth in between when necessary. It feels wonderful and the scent is pleasant and pretty light. I then apply my favorite face cream, Otterganics Daydream Day Cream: Organic Anti Aging Cream, for a dry face with sensitive skin, 1.7oz.Since I have begun using this, once to twice a week, I can definitely see the difference in my pores. They are smaller and/or more refined. This seems to regulate my skin a bit. My skin is dry combination, but this would work great on any skin type. My skin feels wonderfully soft after using this Mask and it really helps keep my oily zones more clear without over-drying my dry zones. Another excellent product from Sky Organics. I'm very happy with this Mud Mask and would purchase it again. I got this for christmas, and I love it. The texture is really smooth and pleasant, which also lets it go on your face really nicely, it's easy to get it smooth even with just your fingers.I have it on right now, and this is the third time i've used it. I've got teenage acne-prone skin and every time I use this, the next day my face is noticably less red and feels lighter, like there's less stuff on my face.also worth noting is that is seems like i'll be able to use this a bunch of times. it takes very little to cover a large portion of your face. I absolutely LOVE this mask! I've tried several different face masks in my life and this one is by far my favorite! I've been on a journey of healing and cleansing my body so when I saw this mask and read all the reviews I knew I had to try it for myself. I have ordered other products from this company that were also excellent quality and worked fantastic so I figured this would too & IT DID 👍 It just feels so good when it's on your face and it actually felt moisturized when I was done instead of dry like other masks I've used in the past. And when I say moisturized I don't mean oily at all, it just feels really soft the way skin should feel. My pores were drastically smaller and less visible after just one use which I had no idea would happen so that was definitely a plus in my book 👍 This mask is made from only natural, organic ingredients which is probably why it works so well. Peolpe all over social media are raving about SkyOrganics and the results that they are getting from using their products and now here I am doing the same thing. I only post reviews when something works really well and I am excited about it. If your looking to try out a new mask, you have got to give this one a try. You will not regret it! They also have several other excellent products on the market now that I want to try since I've been more than happy with the last 3 that I have tried out. I give this mask 5 full stars! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️If you found my review helpful, please let me know by clicking on the ""helpful"" button below. And I will be glad to answer any questions that you might have 😊 I have used many mud masks over the years.  Most are are thick and not easy to apply.  This one was easy to apply I used a make up brush to apply it went on smoothly.  I left the mask on for 15 minutes and then rinsed off with warm water.  After patting my face dry it felt soft , firmer and brighter. I will definitely be using this once an week and recommending to my friends. My skin always feels fresh, invigorated, and smooth after this mask. Deep sea mud is the only way to go. I will definitely buy this product again. My middle-aged skin needs a kick and I appreciate being able to feel it work. People with sensitive skin might find it to be a bit too much, but I love it. I wanted to add a mud mask to my facial skin care regiment.  I have normal skin which tends to dry using some products.The Sky Organics Dead Sea Mud Mask comes in an 8.8 oz. container for a great price and can be used sparingly to last a while. I was somewhat concerned as I have only used one other dead sea mask product in my life and, even then, was not sure how my face would react even though I have never really had a bad reaction to products.  In general, mud masks exfoliate and suck up dirt and oil that have gathered on the face during the day and has also minimized my pores.  These masks are generally unique due to a high concentration of salts and minerals.  After using this mud mask my face felt very soft, clean, fresh and more lively.  I use a thin layer over my face and after a short time the effects of the mask were evident even when on I could feel it working.  The product label states it is 100% Natural with Organic Ingredients and is rich in dead sea minerals. I recommend googling desk sea masks for the benefits.I will be recommending this product to friends, family and co-workers and will continue to use it. Dead Sea Mud Mask by Sky Organics For Face, Acne, Oily Skin & Blackheads - Best Facial Pore Minimizer, Reducer & Pores Cleanser Treatment - Natural & Organic Mud Mask For Younger Looking Skin 8.8oz This is a nice size product and I am impressed with the packaging.  It arrived as expected and was closed with a plastic seal band on the exterior of the jar.  Also the jar was wrapped in bubble wrap to ensure it was not damaged in shipping.  I have used it once and was very pleased and plan to continue using the product. I tried this as soon as I opened the package. I am super impressed with this mask. I'll have to do a follow-up as to how it improves my skin, but my first experience was great.First off, the smell is very pleasant! The consistency of the product is great and easy to apply and remove. It left my skin feeling clean and refreshed.I'll definitely continue using this product! The dead sea mud mask arrive during the estimated time. The mask was easy to apply. It made my face feel nice and smooth after usage with no break out on my sensitive skin. No smell or harsh chemical all pure organic I have been using this Dead Sea Mud Mask for sometime and love it.  I purchased the 2nd jar to give to my daughter.  Get prepared....you don't look to pretty with this on and waiting for it to dry.  But it is well worth it because it leaves my skin feeling tighter, smoother and glowing. This mask is amazing. My skin feels refreshed and renewed every time I use it. This along with the Sky Organics raw unrefined cocoa butter as a night and post mask moisturizer has completely changed my skin care game for the better! I'm so happy I came across this company's products. I love Sky Organics! Everything I've tried has been fabulous! This Dead Sea mask is so easy to use and makes you feel like your at a salon.It comes in a plastic container and is sealed great.I like using mine with a spatula so I don't contaminate the product with my fingers.I like to put this on my neck, face, and shoulders, then take a bath. It dries pretty quick, so I like to have a washcloth to damp the areas with the Dead Sea mask. (Make sure to use a dark washcloth)It has a very light smell, refreshing. I like the product and use it a few times a week. It tightens the skin great!  Highly suggest this product! I bought this Dead Sea Mud Mask for my daughter because she broke out with acne this past Christmas due to stress from school or life in general! Anyway, this seems to help her a lot. She only used it for a few times but her face has started to clear. Hopefully, it would continue to help! This mask is amazing!  It has the purest and only most essential ingredients and feels so creamy and luxurious going on.  It glides on so smoothly and washes off easily, leaving my face unbelievably soft and supple.  Adding this to my weekly repertoire! I had recently been noticing my skin has been looking redder and the pores more visible.  Winter!  Ugh!  So I wanted to try something like this to see if it could help!  Boy, did it.  It made my face visibly more tight and left it feeling soft. I LOVE this mud mask. It's really thick so it doesn't take much to go on/cover your face. I have really just bad, acne-prone, sensitive, combination skin, so I'm always trying different products and masks. I have a Shea Moisture mud mask that cost as much as this did, and even though I like that one too, I feel this is a MUCH better mask for the price. It doesn't dry my skin and leaves it feeling nice and soft. For a person like me, who hasn't been able to actually RID my acne for almost a year, mostly my products are all about skin management now. This mask REALLY helps me keep my skin under control (of course in combination with the rest of my skin care routine) but I like that I can use this mask daily/nightly without it drying my skin out. I would definitely buy this product again, have had a friend use it who also loved the way it feels. But it'll be awhile before I have to, it's a good size for how much product you actually get out of the jar. My friend has been to the Dead Sea and swam in it, she told me she would love to have a pool of that in her backyard!  It makes your skin feel so fresh and soft!  The smell is very relaxing too.  You can feel the deep exfoliation once you rinse.  Would definite buy again! I really love the Sky Organics products. This mud musk really works. After i used it my skin was noticeabke smooth even after 4 days i used it. It comes from Israel so it is 100% from the Dead Sea. Have been using it for two days now. I have been getting acne and it does help in mellowing them down. It has a neutral odor and feels cool on application. Really happy with the product. Good buy. Absolutely wonderful for my skin. Clears my acne and left my skin glowing and smooth :) I've used this only once so far and I like it!! Doesn't have strong or bad smell which I love. After using, my face feels so smooth!! Love it so far. I will update after a couple more uses. My face is NOTICEABLY better right after using. I feel like it tones my face and make a it even, so make up looks much better too. This is a wonderful mask! It makes my skin feel very soft and moisturized without being oily. Wouldn't say it smells good, but I've read about some mud masks having a bad stench and this doesn't at all. It doesn't really even have a smell. Overall, great product that will last a long time! VERY GOOD PRODUCT . NICE PACKAGING ... WORKS AS DESCRIBED .... THX This is better than the mud masks I've tried in the past. It goes on smooth like butter and rinses off easily. It dries up pimples pretty well. My only complaint is that the cap is a little hard to screw back onto the jar sometimes. Love this! Makes the skin on my face feel so clean and firm. Goes on easy, cleans up easy, smells subtle yet pleasant. Fun beauty treat. Would buy again. Highly recommend Do this once a week and acne is severely reduced! I used a salt scrub to clean it off and amp up the effects! This a a really good mud mask. The mask really helps to make my skin feel rejuvenated after using it. I definitely would recommend this product to others. I LOVE THIS MASK I HAVE TRIED OTHER MASKS & THEY HAVE DRIED OUT MY FACE BUT NOT THIS ONE I LOVE OT!!!!!!!! Absolutely Amazing! I just got this mask a few days ago, and have used it only once, as the directions say to use once a week. I could tell the second I opened it and put it on my face it was going to be wonderful. It smells, natural and feels like nothing I've ever put on my skin before. After I rinsed it off I was amazed at how soft and moisturized (but NOT oily), my skin was! As a Mom of 4 in my 30's now, my skin is doing some crazy things, including breakouts once a month, dry, dull, dead skin that wouldn't go away so it clogged my pores, and breastfeeding my youngest daughter doesn't help with the hormones and my skin. I love this mask, I would recommend it to every one and I am SO excited to use it again next week and see what my skin looks like in a month or so!! This is a very nice mud mask.  Goes on easy and actually smells pretty good.  I have sensitive skin and this doesn't cause any irritation or problems and doesn't cause any breakouts .  I definitely recommend this mask and I am very happy with this purchase. This product was thick and went on smooth. It cleaned my face really well. I definitely keep using it and highly recommend to everyone. My order arrived on time and I have had the chance to use the mask several times. The deep sea mud mask has a very light, natural scent. It feels smooth and cool when applying. As it dries your skin feels firm but not tight and dry. Make sure to rinse well because the mask is very dark and will leave gray marks on the towel if you do not rinse it all off. My skin is super sensitive and I had no reaction from using this mask. I have never used a mask which made my skin feel as smooth and healthy as the Dead Sea Mud Mask by Sky Organics. I would definitely recommend it! This is a great mask and my skin feels so fresh and clean when I am done using it...I use a mask at least four times per week and use this one two of those four days as it has great ingredients and is pretty easy to remove ...I use one of those sponges that is yellow and looks like swiss cheese and it rinses great when using it.....having sensitive skin this is gentle enough for me to leave on for twenty to thirty minutes and have no redness what so ever when I am done....my fourteen year old even uses it with no problem..and I do mind as it has organic ingredients... Leaves face feeling fresh, soft and smooth. It did not irritate my skin or cause an allergic reaction especially since I have sensitive skin. We love this. My granddaughter thinks she is spa ready after her first treatment (6yrs and heading to the spa--think again) Ive used this product two times and I like the results. It doesn't dry out my skin or make it oily. It also leaves my skin feeling very soft and clean! Would recommend! I love this dead sea mud mask. My face has never felt softer, smoother, or cleaner than it did after I used this mask. Another great product from sky organics. So far everything that I have purchased from this company has been amazing. I have very sensitive skin so I’m very hesitant when I try something new on my skin because I’m afraid that I will break out. but so for everything I have used from sky organics has been great for my skin. Are use this and he went on very smoothly a little goes a long way It was very easy to use and very easy to wash off. No bad smell and I love the way it made my skin feel after. this is  Definitely going to be a weekly part of my skin routine Love the way this mask feels and how my skin reacts! This product got me through my period without a breakout (and I'm usually prone to breaking out during that time especially.) And I also love that it's all organic! Loved it! It didn't pull my skin as it dried line other masks. My skin felt soft and moisturized after using this. Love it! Great buy. Feels great on and comes off nicely. Makes my face feel super soft. I have tried a lot of mud mask and this is one of the best mud mask. It is smooth to apply and it feels so good after applying. It is all natural and organic ingredients. This sea mud mask is really a nice product. It goes on smoothly and comes off pretty easily. The mask I bought it for my 14 year old daughter, who is having issues with acne and blackheads and this stuff has really been helping to get rid of it. She hates putting it on, but I make her do it. I am going to have to try it on my face too. It seems to make your skin really smooth and soft too and I really need that. The mask does have a smell, but it is really not a bad smell at all, just smells a little like mud which is what it is lol. I purchased this mask 2 weeks ago and used about 3 times. I have problem with blackheads and pimples (the deep ones that take forever to heal) and already notice the difference in my skin. I love this mask and will order it again when I run out. I love using Dead Sea mud masks on my face. This brand is on par with other brands and I would use it again. Really works! Tried it as soon as it came in and it left my skin feeling softer and clean. Very happy with the product so far. The mask is easy to apply and cleaned my pores fabulously Simply amazing! Noticeable difference in my skin after the first use. It smells fantastic too! Love how this product tightens  my skin and makes it super soft, while clearing my pores. This mask makes my face feel super clean and soft. I love the fact that it is organic and cruelty free. I have a busy schedule and can't put it on as often as I'd like but whatever I do I am very excited. This mask is exactly what I was looking for. I have large pores on my nose and my dermatologist recommended a clay mud mask. I tried this product and found it to be perfect for my pores. It is thick and easily spreads  on my nose and face. You don't have to use very much to make a good mask so this is going to last quite a long time which makes it very economical. After use my pores were already smaller. I am very very pleased with this product! AFTER USING THIS JUST ONE TIME MY SKIN FELT CLEANER AND SOFTER. I LOVE IT Good product so far. I have used this several times and it works great. Feels effective when applied to face, makes your skin feel very nice. Love this mask. It works like a charm. I tried this as an experiment for my face: most masks leave my face feeling taught and dry. I wanted something that would simultaneously moisturize and firm my skin. The mask has a very thick, clay-like consistency with a nice gray color. It goes on smoothly, and I left it on for 15 minutes as the label instructs, and it washed off easily. It left my skin feeling firmer, brighter, and moisturized (but not oily in the least). My pores on my cheeks were cleansed and the blackheads on my nose were not even noticeable anymore. I was VERY pleased. I followed with my usual regime of moisturizers/eye cremes/serums and my face honestly feels rejuvenated. Picked this up due to a sale and figured it'd be something cool to try with the girlfriend. I've never actually applied a mud mask before so my experience with this is that of a total noob.Before I used this I gave my face a quick wipe down. Air dried for about 5 minutes. I opened the jar and was expecting to see the kind of mud you'd expect after a rainy dad. Thats not the case. Its like a thick cream. I dipped my finger in and pulled out a dab to apply as a test. Pulling it out of the jar isn't difficult. I applied to my face and it was pretty malleable. After that, it felt safe, so I dug into it and smeared it all over. No offensive smell.I'm not sure if this is how it is for all types of mud masks but i feel like i needed a little more than i should to get coverage. Once applied, the gf and I watched a 30 minute show and then fought for the sink. This isn't any indication of how bad we wanted it off our faces but more of how competitive we both are. I won.It was pretty easy to take off and my skin actually felt a little softer. I think i'll continue to use and purchase if its on sale. Already in love with the product I have used it once since I got it and it made my face feel so good! I could actually feel it in my pores a light clean feeling while on my face! Got it fast! I'll be ordering more! I never write reviews but I really wanted to on this product.  It is amazing.  Cleared my face up in one use!  I will continue to buy this mask! awesome mask. I use it daily now before my shower I absolutely love this products. I appreciate simple ingredients and the fact that there is no synthetic fragrance in this product. It feels and smells very pure.It works amazing for oily, combination skin, enlarged pores or any impurities like blackheads. I wouldn't recommend it for people with very dry/dry skin by itself, however you could mix it with moisturizing oil or similar.I have no complains about this product or company. They are very professional, respond fast to emails, they ship on time and everything came packed perfectly. so great, just what I wanted from a mud mask! not too thick and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin at all Very smooth to apply on, left on my face for 15 minutes and my face felt great afterwards! works great nice feel, great color and just wonderful feeling, I love this mud, so clean feeling and refreshing, I really enjoy its easy wash off too Small jar for the price but works well and makes my face feel smith after! I love Sky Organics and own and have purchased a majority of their products and I absolutely love them, and this mud mask is no exception. I love using mask and have tried many different ones, some that were great while others were horrible. I love the way my face feels after using this mask, it's so nice. This is one of my go to brands when purchasing products and I highly recommend them. Love this - bought it when there was an amazon sale - spur of the moment and glad I did.  My skin gets really soft and I've noticed my blemishes fade away.  Awesome product! I started really taking care of my skin when I started Cosmetology school at the age of 15. At 44, to say I've tried dozens of masks is if anything, an understatement. I had and still have combination/oily skin and so have always used pore refining or clay masks. While they've had different gimmicks over the years, with this or that ""new"" thing being added, in essence they've all been about the same. Clay or ""mud"" masks thatabsorb excess oil from pores and help to dry up existing acne. Some were a bit tingly from mint and others a bit stingy from any number of contributors, ie. alcohols, acids, and/or fragrances. Some were so drying they left my skin feeling like the Sahara and some did absolutely nothing and were totally pointless. My point is, in over 30 years of masking, not a single one has really stood apart from the rest. Until now. THIS mask is in a class all its own! Immediately, as soon as you scoop some out and begin to apply it your skin, you feel something ""different"". To put a finer point on it, I'd have to say it feels really, REALLY smooth. No burning, stinging on tingling. As strange as this is going to sound, it's absolutely true ... it feels HYDRATING. And while it sits on the skin hydrating it, it's also pulling oil out of the pores like crazy! Something else I noticed; you know how with a typical ""mud"" mask, when the oil comes out of the pores you get the little dark colored dots where the oil's been absorbed by the mud? With this mask, the oil pools on top. The mud doesn't absorb the oil, it wicks it out to the surface. Not only is this a really cool thing to witness (lol) but since the mud isn't saturated there's no limit to the amount of oil it can absorb. I'm always so fascinated by the amount of oil being drawn out that I'll sit in front of a mirror with a tissue and blot the pools as they form only to watch another form in its place and blot again. I know that sounds crazy but when you have super oily skin it's really satisfying! Then after all that oil comes out you'd think you'd be dry as a bone but it's just the opposite, your face feels baby soft and smooth, not at ALL greasy. There's no residue at all. This is the only mask I've ever used that does two things at once; absorbs and hydrates. Doesn't even sound possible but it totally is!I'm extremely happy with this purchase, I call it my ""Magic Mud"" :) Amazing.  Doesn't break out or make face red. Love it I have sensitive and dry skin.  This mask is amazing! It leaves my skin feeling so soft and moisturized.  I've been using Sky Organics products for awhile, I'll definitely be buying this again! The best stuff ever! Makes my face feel so good and smooth! Only used it twice, but my face feels fresh after. Not all dry and crappy. Can I use it more than once a week tho'?! Haha Dead Sea Mud Mask by Sky Organics For Face, Acne, Oily Skin & Blackheads - Best Facial Pore Minimizer, Reducer & Pores Cleanser Treatment - Natural & Organic Mud Mask For Younger Looking Skin 8.8ozThis is stuff is great.  Cleans and softens your skin.  Feels good when you apply it and when you take it offPros:smells greatfeels goodseasy to removeCons:None at this timeI am pleased with my purchase of Dead Sea Mud Mask by Sky Organics For Face, Acne, Oily Skin & Blackheads - Best Facial Pore Minimizer, Reducer & Pores Cleanser Treatment - Natural & Organic Mud Mask For Younger Looking Skin 8.8oz and will suggest this to other people.Please click yes below if this review has been helpful I am up SAST with these mud masks and can't say enough about them. This is actually my second time purchasing from this company because I love their masks. The container is quite large so it's a great bye compared to some of the other charcoal masks I bought and mud masks I've purchased in the past. I suffer from deep cystic acne  so I really need to do mud masks and charcoal masks at least a couple times a week to keep my skin clear and the acne at bay. This product has been a necessity for me in my treatment regimen. My friends also love doing these as well. When I come over for a girls night Sarah always asking to do the mud masks. They make your face and skin so clear and soft. They don't over dry it at all either which is something I really like because I use so many caustic chemicals on my face. Make sure you seal the jar tightly between use because it is such a large container and so it can dry out if you leave it open overtime. I do use a very soft face brush to apply this but you can also use Q-tips as well to get the same effect. I want to post a picture of this item but Facebook isn't allowing me to add photos to my reviews at this time. I'm not sure why that is but I will post the photos hopefully when this feature becomes available to me again in the future. For now though, I definitely recommend this product if you're looking for something to clean your face naturally and leave you with smooth soft skin. I got this to see if it would improve my sons highly acne prone skin. All things being equal as to what we have been doing, I can say this has done some noticeable improvements. We follow the instructions and leave it on for 15 minutes then he uses a warm towel to take it off. My son has such oily skin even minutes after washing it, he produces it like a factory. This mask really helped to delay that oil production and made his skin feel closer to 'normal' without drying it out. It is recommended to use once a week, but we use it twice due to his bad acne, but I am seeing improvements. This is a normal size jar but not needing to use a whole lot, I can see it lasting us a good amount of time, well worth the money. And, the bonus is, is that it is organic. I love the way this mask makes my skin feel. I have combination skin and really large pores. After using this mask my skin feels extremely clean and my pores are much tighter and much less visible. I only wish more of the mask came in the jar! I've Used it a few times now. I definitely notice a difference in my skin. It's very smooth. Great product. A little goes a LONG WAY. It has a nice cooling effect. You can feel it working and tightening the skin, but I'm sure that mainly due to it drying. Afterwards it does make your skin feel softer. You can leave it on longer than it says to, no problem. It has kinda hard to wash off, but that is due to the type of product it is (mud). Very fun and man, does it leave ur face soft!! My face felt amazing for days! Not just that day like most masks I've tried. This was great! Would highly recommend (: I am totally in love with my Dead Sea mud mask by sky organics. My daughter and I both have use the product and we're very pleased with it. It makes your skin feels so smooth and soft and moisturized.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wishes to enhance their beauty products collection. Works wonderful and I would say definitely give it a try. Pretty good, I feel really smooth after. Doesn't break the bank either! I've been using it once a week! Despite being a little messy, this product is well worth trying.  My face suddenly went from dry to oily after some physical stresses and using this mud mask has helped control the oil.  I put it on at my sink, leave it on 15 minutes and rinse off in the shower.  Much less mess. I love this mud. It made my face feel so smooth. I have sensitive skin & this mud didn't cause my face to turn red after removing it like all the other mud masks I have tried in the past. Definitely recommend! Loved it! Works really well and it's super fun to use! Great product ! Definitely recommend. Didn't dry out my skin and saw quick results! Absolutely LOVE this product. I've used many face masks recently but this applies easily, washes off smoothly and makes your skin feel extremely moisturized for hours after, which does not happen with all face masks. Works great took away my blackheads I love it 💖Thanks Sky Organics❗️ I love this mask! My skin is quite sensitive and has horrible reactions to a lot of products and I was surprised to find that this didn't no make my face even a little bit red when I washed it off! My skin was smoother and looked brighter and felt so soft! Also, a little bit of this goes a long way so I have a feeling I will be able to use it for awhile before I have to purchase more! My first time using this tonight. I applied a thin layer as instructed, and after 15 minutes I washed it off. Love how my face feels so soft!! The scent is soft as well. I really like this mask. Feels really good going on. Like a soft clay consistency i guess.  My skin feels soft and refeshed after i wash it off. I would def buy it again. Great clarifying mask. I love using masks regularly to add to my normal skincare regime. I love that it's organic. My skin overall has improved so much in the past few years since switching to organic skincare. This mask leaves my face feel very clean and works as a blemish preventative for me. All I can tell you is my daughter and my wife love the stuff. My daughter was expecially happy to see it because about a year-and-a-half ago she spent a year or so in Israel and she had been to the Dead Sea and she had tried some stuff over there that she like but when she came back here she just never got back into it. My daughter has a bit of an acne problem and so she has tried lots of different stuff some of it prescription some of it not and she does enjoy these mud mask she likes the way it helps rub out her pores and she says her face just feels a little bit more refreshing afterwards. My wife did it for the first time with her and she seemed to like it too I thought they both looked a little silly but they enjoyed it and she's going to be using it from now on and in the future This product has delivered on its promise.  I've only used it once but it was everything it said it would be.  I'm looking forward to seeing what it will do in the long run (states it should only be used one a week).  Packaging was great. I love this mud mask. I have sensitive skin and it does not irritate it at all! It makes my face feel clean and smooth. I am very pleased with it This product is really awesome. Works very well. We are very pleased with the product and the seller. Nice mud mask!! Skin felt very clean after use without any irritation. Washed off nicely without residue. Would recommend! This is probably my favorite product out of all the Skyorganics line.  It really deep cleans my face and it feels very luxurious on.  The mask is nice and thick, but still goes on smoothly. I love this dead sea mud mask! The texture is clay-like and a very thick but doesn't have an overwhelming smell. You don't have to put very much on your face to get the desired results. I found that putting a thin, even layer worked best and dried nicely. My skin feels really tight once it dries and then I just rinse it off after 10-15 minutes. I like to apply this right before taking a bath.This is something that I try to do on a weekly basis and I find it leaves my face feeling so soft. The results are pretty immediate and I'm curious to see what the long term results will be. I recently purchased a brush which I think helps with application but have been using my fingers and find it works for now. Overall this product met my expectations and I would recommend it to others. IN LOVE. I will have this in my routine forever. I've only used it twice (over two weeks time) and it worked like a charm both times. A little goes a long way. Very happy with my purchase. My skin felt like new after first use. This dead seamud mask is fantastic! It does a great job at cleansing my facial skin. It is easily applied and deep cleanse my facial skin in a natural way. It leavez my facial skin feeling refreashed and cleansed. It is easily removed from face. Instructions are easily read. This is seriously the best mask I have ever used! I have very sensitive skin but with it being organic and other reviews were great, I decided to try it. It helps the redness with my inflammation on my face and really makes my skin look better. I will def be looking at this company for more products. I didn't hesitate at all to order form ""Sky Organics"" when I was looking for a mud mask for my teenage daughter (whose prone to breakouts right now)…I've purchased MANY things from their skincare and body lines in the past and just love them as a company:)We've been using the Keihls clay mask but it was too drying for her combo skin. The Sky Organics ""Dead Sea Mud Mask"" is a great new fit for her as it still has the detox & healing aspects of a mask but not drying at all. It does help with her breakouts if used 2x week - the smell is pleasant (its mud after all) and the price is great!Seller ships fast & things are factory sealed & dated for safety factor:)If you find this review helpful please click the ""yes"" button.I do a lot of reviews so here is a breakdown on how I determine my star rating of a product:5 stars – I love it! It is awesome and I highly recommend everyone to purchase this product!4 stars – I like it, but there are some flaws but I would purchase again.3 stars - It was okay, but I would probably not buy it again unless there are no other options.2 stars – There may be worse products out there, but you can definitely find something better.1 star – I dislike the product, I wish I had not purchased it and will not recommend the product to others. Wife happy Makes my face feel fantastic. Only have used it once so I can't say if it minimizes pores as said. My daughter used it last night and said how good her face felt. So we will know in a few weeks if my pores are minimizing and causing her less breakouts. I do like this product so far. Great price! Makes my face fell really soft and rejuvenated. Daughter and I both used this mask after washing our face. She applied with fingers while I applied with a firm makeup brush. We both commented on how nice and smooth the mask felt. We followed the directions. Afterwards both our faces felt very soft. It's extremely dry here but I felt e mask moistureized. Especially my dry nose. Will definitely be using once a week Best of the best I really like this mud mask, and even better because it's made with natural ingredients. It left my skin really soft. And it smelled nice. I'm going to have my teenagers use it on their skin for acne. Haven't had a chance yet. I bought this for my daughter to use shes been asking for a mud mask for a while. this she has used it a couple of times now she says it makes her face feel soft when she takes if off and helps some with her breakouts. so good product This is the best mask I've ever used.  Love it.  I could immediately see a difference in my skin.  My skin looks revitalized with a youthful glow! As a licensed esthetician, i see a lot of masks on the market that claim to help with acne.  Really happy with this dead sea mack from sky organics.  Not only does it helps with acne, and comedones, but it is chocked full of amazing vitamins and minerals.  Very satisfied customer.  Looking forward to using this on clients! I thoroughly enjoyed using this product, I will definitely be purchasing it again when I run out of the one I currently have. I love how it smells and feels on my face! It leaves my skin refreshed and hydrated. I love using face masks and this is one of my favorite ones yet! You get a good amount of product and the tub is cute and can be re-purposed. Good My face feels and looks amazing after using my mud mask!! Loved this product, just be prepared to breakout a bit after use. Only use once a week This was my first time purchasing this product, it went on smoothly and came off nicely (only need to use warm water to rinse off).  I like it as it makes my skin feels so softly after first use. I will buy again once it runs out :D Great mask!  Makes my skin feel great, and only needs a tiny amount with each application!  This is a once a week application, so it works into my beauty regimen easily!! :) LOVE IT I have only used this twice now, (once per week) but already like the results Love this stuff!  It leaves my skin super soft and fresh!  I use it once or twice a week.  No discomfort or irritation and I do have sensitive skin! Excellent mask, best one I've had so far.  Very clean, refreshing, thick.  It's going to last me forever! I was pleasantly surprised by the immediate effect of this mask. I have mostly dry skin and the  relief and moisturizing feeling is great. I'll see how it works on the long run, but so far after a couple of weeks it has been awesome. My face feels so soft and clean. I've never used such a great product. I like the smell and texture of the product. Makes me feel like I've been to the spa. Thanks! This is an excellent Mud Mask.  Goes on so smoothly, has a nice fragrance, removes easily with a wet wash cloth.  My skin feels clean and bright.  Reminds me of the saying, ""We're all in our places with bright, shiny faces.""  :D  Thanks for a great product! I bought this due to the great reviews but I can say I didn't go wrong. I use it everyday once a day. My skin feels so much softer and the glow, it looks less shiny. I wish I could use it in my whole body. I'm 30 years old now and treating my skin, specially my face is Very important for me. Keeping my skin softer and hydrating is essential to avoid early aging and that's something this mask is helping me accomplished. This is a very nice mask. Natural ingrediants with a light, pleasant smell. The mask is easy to use, similar to other dead sea mud masks I've used. Recommended. Great mud mask. Face feels so clean and refreshed after use. Only problem is as soon as I put it on, my dog wants to go out. He unfortunately must wait. It leaves my skin so soft and has worked wonders on my black heads LEAVES MY SKIN FEELING VERY SMOOTH. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. AS INSTRUCTED I ONLY USE THIS ONCE PER WEEK. IT IS SO AWESOME. GREAT PRODUCT FOR A GREAT VALUE. Great product. Everyone in my family has tried it and they loved it. So impressed. Gentler than expectedInstructions state to not use more than once a weekEasy removal with warm water and rinsing with fingers Smells amazing, organic ingredients and leaves skin flawless Great product This is a great product, it gets all the oil out of your skin. My skin is sensitive and I've tried all kinds of products to get the bumps and oil out of my skin. This product keeps my skin feeling great nearly all week. Sky Organics have the best products. I am never afraid to use them. This mask leaves your skin feeling and looking smooth and silky I Love this mud mask. Makes my face feel so soft after wards and helps keep my oil under control I bought this for my daughter and she really loves it! She says it makes her skin very smooth and soft. Good mask! This jar will last me a while, too. It doesn't have a very strong scent and it goes on pretty thick. Works very well! This is so creamy, with a pleasant smell. I bought it as a gift, and my daughter loves it. I was impressed that it is all natural, and from the Dead Sea. So many people from all around the world go to the Dead Sea to find healing, so it made me happy to know I was giving my daughter something nourishing. Good product. Great ! I bought the Dead Sea Mud Mask for myself to use to clear up my face a bit after a brutal winter. I used it once so far and I have to say I am very impressed. First off there is really no smell to it and the mask is very easy to put on. I felt a little tightening on my face while I was sitting for 15-minutes waiting for it to dry, but I expected that. I washed it off with luke warm water in circular motion as per the directions, It came off easily as well. Instantly, my face felt smooth and very clean. Two days passed since I used it and it still feels very smooth. I plan on using it twice a week in the beginning until my skin becomes better, and then once a week after. I also love the fact that the ingredients are all natural, which is exactly what I was looking for. I have purchased organic lip balm before from this brand, which was also fantastic. I plan on buying more products from Sky Organics in the future. Smell really good! Too bad I can't use it everyday hahaha!!!! ❤️it  my skin so smoothly after I was looking for a mask that is good for sensitive skin, so I decided to try the  Dead Sea Mud Mask.

I used this product for the first time today & it made my skin so soft & I automatically noticed a change in the amount of oil in my skin! Definitely recommend Makes your skin feel very soft .

B00406ZI3E," Have used this product before. Provides moisture without feeling greasy. Great for scars.  Had stomach surgery and used this and it was amazing.  Just wish I could afford to use it for my wrinkles. Outstanding results for minimizing scarring. I love this cream. I have been using it for years. Works for me... It came in a timely manner and was a good price. Thank you Very Pleased with purchase & quick delivery! My dermatologist sells this and recommended this product to me. It feels amazing when you apply it (goes on like velvet).  I can't say I notice a drastic difference, but slightly!  I purchased on here for my second bottle vs my doc since it was close to half the price.  I use it in the morning & evening. I'm a 33 yo female, trying to fight the fight early against wrinkles Great product. It goes on nicely and absorbs quickly. I'll be turning 48 in 5 days and I get compliments about my complex, daily. Used this for years, & you will actually see results after you use it just once. No other product has ever made me look or feel moisturized, & I have extremely sensitive skin from broken capillaries & dryness. It's expensive, but I use it because I see results using this product. My dermatologist recommended it, & I've tried others too but I went back to this because of the results I see Ordered this and the Neocutis Journee Day Cream.  Have only had them for a few days but so far so good.  Both feel very good on the skin and I'm quite happy with both products She really likes this product but I can't tell you why.  This was a great price at the time of this order, so will buy again. Unbelievable price for such a quality product. Love it Safe product and is one of the best moisturizers around. Very nice and good for sensitive aging skin. My dermotologost sold me the eye cream in this brand and it is the Best I have ever used (age 57). I ordered it here on Amazon and it was about 1/2 the price I paid at my doctors office. I worked in salons & spas for over 30 years and I find this skin care line to be the best I have ever used. I started using Neoocutis Skin care products several months ago and my skin feels great!  Apparently, others have noticed as well since I've  received compliments on the appearance of my skin since I began using this line of skin care. Love this product!! I have been purchasing this from my esthetician for years, but moved out of state and didn't want to have to pay to have it shipped to me. Light bulb moment....why haven't I checked out Amazon?  Bingo!!! Same quality for MUCH less expensive. Very satisfied. Excellent product. I plan to order it regularly. My dermatologist had recommended this product. super product, super price, quick shipping I have used this product for almost a year, and feel my skin is better than ever even at 69 years old. Keeps sensitive skin/rosacea calm. When used daily it really makes a difference and I do not have to use medicated creams. I use with retin-a and under all other make-up to prevent redness. It is the one product that my dry sensitive skin can't be without. Excellent product.  Serum,  moisturizer , and sun protection.  Gives slight coverage , mostly to even out skin tone.  For more coverage I apply make up over it.  Neocutis products are the best. I have been using Neocutis  Biorestorative Cream for over a year. I get lots of compliments on my skin and I am 65+. Great stuff! Great product @ fabulous price and 2 day delivery with Amazon Prime - very happy! Very refreshing and recommended by our dermatologist.  Love it. Wife had some laser to face and this is the cream recommended. I love Neocutis!  This stuff is amazing!  Works great, feels good and smells very clean and fresh.  I love it! The consistency is great. It doesn't make you greasy and doesn't get your necklines dirty. I use it under sunscreen and makeup and it works. It was recommended by my doctor because of some very intense winter dryness and it helped with that. I am not convinced that it makes me look younger but it makes my skin less dry and feels good. I would buy again. love this product - my skin looks & feels great. wife uses this all the time and loves it I love all Neocutis products. I wish they weren't so expensive but they are great so I guess that's why. I use their eye cream which I have found to be very effective in reducing fine lines. At my age nothing topical will get rid of the deeper ones.The face cream is the same. I've noticed that my skin does not dry out during the day and it works well with makeup.I highly recommend this product. I’ve been using this product for a couple years and love it. Keeps my skin moisturized and the price on Amazon is much more affordable. Great for keeping my face looking fresh & hydrated. Plus I have sensitive skin and no issues with this product. Was recommended by my dermatologist. Highly recommended by my dermatologist. Great product!!  Arrived on time as promised. After being bit by a cat on my hand, plastic surgery was needed.This product helped the healing.The scar is visable from surgery but the healing properties is what I love about it. My sister told me about this product and I tried it because I have some spider veins on my chin and a few of those lovely dark spots on the side of my face.  Goes on nicely and (hoping this is not my imagination) the dark spots seem to be fading a bit.  Only been using it for about 2 weeks but I really like the product. Great price! I love this cream. I have extremely dry skin that gets very crepe-y in the winter. This helps keep my skin hydrated and smooth all winter long. Yes, it is expensive but a little does a long way. I only use it in the winter so I only buy 1 per year. I've used this for years and I'm real happy with it. My Dr recommended it. You use very little. I also use eye cream and vitamin C. Never greasy. I'm 66 years old. An excellent cream for a delicate pale skin. Recommended by my dermatologist and while not inexpensive, worth it many times over product is of highest quality. Superb product. Wonderful seller great product, love results Perfect for sensitive skin I love this face cream.  It goes on smoothly and absorbs into your skin easily. The best moisturizer for mature skin that I have ever used. I am over 60 and would recommend the same for anyone with dry skin. Great product, extra fast delivery.  2 big thumbs up!! I like this product a lot, it's my first time using it. A little goes a long way so it lasted close to 2 months. Very soft and smooth, no greasiness or shininess- moisturizes well. It seems to bring out the natural tones in your skin versus ""brightening"" which I do not feel everyone wants or needs. Recommend it. The best skin cream ever! Starting using this about a year ago after my dermatologist recommended it. I have noticed a difference in reduction of fine lines and had comments from others about the noticeable difference. Love it! I love this product however its going up in price way too much.  I was able to get this for $78 now its like $95.  Too much $ but its addicting. I need something new to replace this product. Very happy with transaction and product Love this product and so does my husband.  Will definitely be reordering. The service was excellent! A score of 10. Arrived as the email stated it would; and I have been enjoying the product ever day!!!. 😃😃😃 Wonderful product!  Have used for years!  If you want to change how your skin looks then use this product.  Don't be stunned by the price tag because a little goes a long way and this lasted me 6 months. Nice moisturizer although a little thick.  Good for dry skin. great This was recommended by my dermatologist and I really think it has made a difference in my skin.  I am 67 years old and started using this after a peel.  Much better price on amazon too. Amazing life changing product at an unbelievable price. 100% authentic. Thank you SO MUCH! Great buy Price more reasonable than through my Dermatologist. These are all products that I use on a daily basis.  I have very sensitive skin; fair and allergic to many things.  These products are superior;the price is better through Amazon and delivery was as promised.  Thanks to All! love it! very excited. I first tried it after a peel at my dermatologist office. After I ran out I realized it was the cream not the peel that was making my face look better. My skin is prone to also breakout and this product is not a concern in that area either. I've also purchased the NeoCutis Biorestorative Cream at Amazon.com for years!  This cream is amazing; I look years younger than my real age; but I'll never tell and you'd never be able to guess!! Love this product.  Wear it daily and like the light tint. My favorite product. Really works!!! I love the way this face cream feels; very smooth and silky. Wish it wasn't as pricey as it is. love it! Thank you for the speedy delivery. I was on vacation and realized I didn't bring along enough Bio cream to make it through the week.Happy Face!! Recommended by my dermatologist's aesthetician.  I don't think it is emollient enough, but I am trying it.  She uses it not only as an after-treatment product, but also as a regular moisturizer. This is a fabulous product. I ordered it for my mom, she's 61, and her skin looks positively fabulous. She has purchased multiple times now. Quick shipping and great product! Wonderful stuff. Had surgery and wiped away the scar! Expensive but I use every drop and my skin loves it. Very soothing cream; it is helping to reduce fine lines in my face. This product is wonderful. It treats post surgery scars and other scars extremely well.  It has greatly reduced the keloiding of my scars, along with the look of the scars. very nice product!! I met with a friend yesterday.. She said she could tell a difference in my skin.I told her what I was using.. She will be ordering too! I have been using this product for a few years now.I would recommended this product to others. Great product! It's a great nightly moisturizer that doesn't leave you too oily. My skin has improved ten fold Have used this for years and it helps I have used this product for many years and I will continue to use it. Love this! Another part of a healthy, simple, and effective routine! The look and feel of my skin is age defying.  Love this product! No problems with my order. This is a product my dermatologist sells for a lot more.  I have been using for about 4 weeks and I definately see a result with skin smoothness, tightening and reduction in redness. Exellent product I have been using this product for about 5 years. My dermatologist recommended it. I know it is pricey but it really makes a difference as you get older and your face shows the signs of age. When I first started using it is saw some colleagues who I had not seen for about 6 months and they asked if I had some ""work"" done on my face! Proof positive that it works.  I did pair it with some prescription creams that were part of a daily program so I cannot say that this product alone was entirely responsible but it certainly contributed to the results. Great sale and price. BioCream is by far one of the best anti-aging moisturizers out there...it helps with overall skin tone, texture, and appearance. I've used it for 3 years now and never plan on switching. I did for one day and my make-up looked dull..the BIoCream helps brighten your face. :) Love this stuff! Amazon  is excellent to deal with as well! I had an issue and with one email all was handled with ease and speed. Love this company! Great cream for the face. Expensive but much cheaper on Amazon Love this cream. I use it twice a day. This moisturizer is fantastic. Although, if you have oiler skin, I wouldn't recommend it as its very rich. Great product; Quick service Love this product have used for years; like it and best price here. Wonderful Product at a great price! Great price compared to a doctor's office that carries it. It helps me not look my old age! excellent product but cap is loose on the dispenser so if try to pick up by top it drops but since hard plastic it does not break  just annoying Can't beat it.  Great product I love the product but not so sure about the packaging.  It is a bit bulky for traveling.  I preferred the original one without the heavy covering even though it is definitely more handsome. I've used this product on and off since 2005. One of the top Dermatologists in Texas recommended it to me. At times I've had budget pressures and have rotated to other brands, but always come back to Neocutis when my skin starts looking tired again.While other brands might do a basic job (there are lots of ""good"" skin creams), this one is outstanding. Supposedly there is no skin cream that actually ""reverses aging,"" as many claim. But I swear Neocutis comes pretty close to it. It makes a huge difference in my skin quality, softness, reducing redness, and reducing fine lines. No one ever guesses my age correctly, so maybe it helps. :)I used to buy this from the Dermatologist's office, which of course was expensive. Pleased to find this on Amazon with a bit of a discount, and so far it's always been delivered to me in great condition, as if I had just picked it up at the Derm's office. Great product, great price, quick delivery!  Highly recommend! This cream was recommended by my doctor post-surgery for the scar on my face after MOHS surgery. Not only is it visibly making a difference on the scar but it is also wonderful on the rest of my face. Fantastic. Great Product. Great moisturizer, very smooth. This is the second bottle I have purchased and I love the stuff.  It is terribly expensive but I really do see and feel better skin.  I recommend. I use it everyday as my nighttime moisturize. I love these products and thanks to Amazon for giving me access to buy them somewhere other than the dermatologist otherwise I could not afford the line. amazing product, my skin looks younger, less wrinkly, i recommend it 100%...  I use it with the gel and the eye cream This is THEE only face cream the lives up to its promises, It's worth the investment and I love the results Excellent product. Love this product. My dermatologist recommends it every day no matter what else you skip. Great price! great product! great product My dermatologist started me on this skin cream over a year ago and, at age 64, I can honestly say that I now have the best skin of my life!  This product feels wonderful and really quenches my skin as well as performing all of the magic of anti-aging in the process.  It provides a beautiful base under foundation - my makeup goes on smoothly and it puts the finishing touch on my night-time skin care routine.  My face feels and looks healthy.  I cannot recommend this product highly enough. Great skin product! Excellent skin cream. Excellent service; no issues with delivery, product is great!! Thank you This cream really works! I use it at night and it only takes one pump to moisturizer my face. I awake in the morning to smoother, firmer looking skin. My wife loves this stuff. If she's happy, I'm happy. Terrific product but with a high price. Use at night before Retina-A to help it absorb better and keep your skin from getting too dry. I have used it for years at my doctor's suggestion. Spreads thin and super emollient.  Love this product! Good product ! Good seller The Best cream I have ever used..Excellent Results This moisturizer is recommended after laser treatments because it has healing properties so why not use it every day!It is cosmetically elegant and is packed with the latest ingredients to improve your skins appearance.  Psp stimulates collegen and plumps up your skin.I use this along with 4 other treatments daily (Skin medica TNS serum, Skin medica VIT C, Lumyxyl for pigmentation problems,  Neocutis Creme Rich eye cream &Sunscreen My favorite face cream.  Please keep in stock... This is a wonderful cream and last quite a long time.  Very silky on your skin and the sunscreen is a real plus.  Really enjoy this product. Have used this product for 5 years now. Was recommended by my dermatologist. Am very satisfied with the results. great Excellent all around I love this product! I also have a really great tip regarding making this product last, considering the price. So, when you run and it doesn't dispense anymore, all you have to do is lie the product down on it's side and leave it on it's side until you run out again, you can get a few more WEEKS of cream out of the pump. I discovered this accidentally. My doctor recommended this product after I had some moles removed from my face. I healed well but kept buying the cream because it keeps my skin supple and youthful, it also keeps my breakouts at bay! No more adult acne! I can't say enough about the BioRestorative Cream with Psp. all three are excellent products on their own, but really are meant to be used together for ultimate benefit. Light, penetrating, soothing and smoothing, great ingredients, only cream I can use that lessens irritation and redness, hydrates and no perfume so no eye or facial swelling Lightweight, doesn't cause break outs. I think it has helped with my pigmentation and overall clarity. I really like! Great product. It is way too expansive but only moisturizer/lotion I am not allergic to. Great product. Best hgh on market according to my Derm Love this product I love this cream!  I'm so glad I found it here on Amazon for such a great price. I have eczema and it is the only thing that has improved my skin! Love this stuff! This cream is amazing. I started using it after a surgical procedure on my doctors recommendation. I did not go back to my high end cream that I use to use. I won't ever change. Love this product!!!! It really does work!!!! It was exactly what I expected and delivered on time. Yes, it is expensive, but I couldn't imagine my life without this facial cream.  I'm a 32-year old man and I've had problematic skin since I was 15.  I've tried every facial cream under the sun and have not found anything like this.  I've been using it for over a year now and I can't get over the results.My skin has never looked better.  Even tone, diminished red spots, smaller pores, refined lines.  Its ability to calm irritated skin is practically immediate.  I have struggled with acne and it's unbelievable how quickly it can heal and clear up scabs or dark spots left by pimples.  Amazing! Have been using this for years!  It is by far the best daily use skin cream I have ever used...Definitely worth the money My dermatologist started me using this face cream 3 years ago and I absolutely love it!  I have very sensitive skin and this is one of the best creams I have found to keep my face moisturized without feeling greasy and without any irritation. I use it both morning and night. I usually purchase it through the doctor's office but they were sold out  and said it would be in the following week.  I did not want to wait and was very pleased to find it here on Amazon for about the same price. I first bought this at my  doctor's office and loved it.  I tried going back to other products, but I have returned to Bio Cream and, as long as I can afford it, I will use only this to soften the ravages of age! I purchased this by mistake in a rush to replace my beloved Neocutis Journee day cream, which I love because it is tinted and contains spf 30 sunscreen.  This cream is still very good, but I wanted something for daytime use.  The products are the same size and the bottle looks the same.  I also use the eye cream, which is also great.  I'm bummed that I'll have to add another step of sunscreen until I use this up. This face cream was originally recommended by my plastic surgeon after facial cancer surgery.  It is helpful, used daily, in repairing scarred skin. With my mild Rosacea,  this cream has worked out the best.  I like the texture, and need very tiny dots to do the job. LOVE IT Love! first,the vendor is fantastic,communicative,second the product is very good.I have been using it only for 1 week,skin is different,luminous and supple.very satisfied,I will buy again I love these products and have been using them for years.  Excellent quality and excellent results everytime.Can recommend it! Great product. My Plastic recommended it and it works. No more dry skin. You should buy it you'll love it too Perfect Just putting on make up this morning and thinking how great my skin feels! I have excema and this has already helped tremendously! Amazing! It's a wonderful product. I use it every day. Makes you skin feel so hydrated and soft. Great smell too. This was a recommendation from my skin center.  They sell many lines and I decided to go with this one after talking with my consultant.  I  have used for 3 years and couldn't be happier.  I also use the eye cream.  I have tried the most expensive products from Saks etc. (LaMer) and I always go back to this gem. Very pleased  with my purchase Been using this for 2 months. I have very good skin to begin with. Didn't think it can get better but it did. My skin looks much younger and smoother. This stuff is amazing. I used the vitamin C serum with this cream as recommended by a previous review, and the result is magical! I used this cream in conjunction with the serum to make the serum last longer.  Together, they are fantastic.  Hard core dimple-wrinkles have been diminished.  This product was recommended by my dermatologist - she uses it - and I have been really happy with it. I use this under my regular sunscreen during the day and under my night cream at night.  It is especially good when I've damaged my skin with too much sun or too many harsh chemical creams. I've used Neocutis for 2 years based on the recommendation of my dermatologist.  After about six months, I noticed marked improvement in my skin (less wrinkles).  I'm hooked. I love it !!! I have chemical peels every six weeks and this cream is the perfect complement to keeping my skin tone even and glowing. It helps in the healing process after peels and is a good moisturizer for everyday as well. It was recommended by the estetician in my dermatologists office but is less expensive to purchase through amazon. She herself said she would not be without it. My dermotologist recommended me this product and told me that it's the one that she has used for years.  It has no scent and is my favorite thing before bed.  As a product it is labeled for post-surgury.  I use it as an eye cream (my eyes are very sensitive to most products but this one I can put on my eye lids and under neith without any irritation).  face cream and on my neck before bed.  If I had to guess in five years I'll thank this product for keeping my face looking so young. I have been using this product for over a year now. It was referred to be my my Plastic Surgeon, Dr Bucko in La Jolla, CA. It is wonderful. Anytime I start to feel like my face is getting tight, I immediately apply the cream and instantly the skin loosens a bit and feels as soft a it did right after my UV Laser Treatment, which I recommend to all. I use it morning and night. Plus, the price on Amazon is WAY less expensive if I get it from my surgeon! My dermatologist recommended this brand 4 years ago.  Of all the products I have tried, this is definitely the best on the market. Have used both the eye and face cream with PSP.  Products are expensive but a little goes a long way and you can save when you buy on Amazon. If you purchase through select phsyicans they are 30-40% more expensive. I am in my mid 50s and have seen a dramatic difference on my face, especially around the eyes. Wrinkles and fine lines have seriously softened.  I get complements all the time on my skin.  Just bought my 79 year old mother the bio-restorative eye cream with psp to try.  Will follow up with her review in month. Neocutis is a great cream, especially if you have had procedures done like microdermabrasion or laser treatments.  Very healing, perfect amount of moisture.  Not greasy.  Soothing. I was given this as a gift after a minor cancer removal on my face.  This product was AMAZING and I have now returned the favor and given it as gifts to others who have had similar surgeries.  I love it as a face moisturizer and it is the only thing I use before I put on Makeup and I use it on any minor cuts that I get that just won't heal.  The scar on my face is undetectable - I highly recommend this product!! I've been using this cream for about a year now - goes on smooth and grease free - best of all it keeps me rosacea and sunburn free.Pros- Extra gentle - Even if you're sunburned or your nose is red and painful from a cold - Neocutis goes on smooth and pain-free and since it's a post-surgery creme, it helps reduce the redness and the burn away rather quickly.- Helped keep my rosacea in check - I suffer from sun-triggered rosacea, so every time I travel to tropical climes, or when the weather warms up, my skin freaks out (my cheeks look like orange peels). This year however, even after the blazing Cambodian sun, I managed to survive with just a light bit of bumpiness (but no itching or redness) on my forehead, but no full blown outbreak or sunburn for that matter. I do admit that I was using the cream multiple times during the evenings after I had washed off the sunscreen and sweat.ConsYes it's expensive - but to not have to suffer through days of itching, redness and just looking miserable - I'd say well worth it. NOT ABORTED FETAL CELLS!! I am an authorized seller of neocutis, although I do not sell on Amazon.  I have read multiple inaccurate reviews talking about it being made by aborted fetal cells.  This product was developed in Switzerland and initially was not researched for cosmetics.  However researchers with the university of Switzerland were studying collagen type 3 which is in abundance prior to 24 weeks gestation, and essentially gone at birth.  A patient miscarried at about 10 weeks.  The fetus in question was incompatible with life.  She did not abort, but miscarried.  However she didn't pass the products of conception on her own and had to have a D&C.  She was asked if she wanted the products, wanted them to be destroyed, or wanted to donate them to science and research.  She chose to donate them.  They were studied and collagen 3, as well as other growth factors, fibroblasts, and Interleukins were extracted.  As is commonly done these cells were placed on auger plates or growth medium to replicate and grow.  Some of the researchers eventually branched out and created neocutis using these harvested cells.  Like other cells they will replicate using the right auger (remember bio 101?!).  The auger medium alone contains no human growth factor.  That is still what is used to make PSP.  They do not use ""aborted fetal cells"".  What is used is cells donated for research and development from one sad, but natural occurrence.  It has been made into hospital cream for wound healing, post skin graft, and burn healing amongst other dermatologic uses including aesthetics.  Do yourself a favor and stop perpetuating inaccurate, false information and do your research. My skin has been wonderful since I started using this cream and it has sunscreen. I have been using this product for 3 years I have used this product for almost a year and have been happy with it until lately.  My face seems to be having a little problem with tiny white bumps.  I stopped using the cream and after two weeks or so the bumps do go away.I miss not using it because it does moisturize my skin,especially in dry and windy weather.I would recommend it to a friend because I have had good luck with it.  Maybe I just used it too often!  It did such a great job in keeping the signs of age away! lolI am giving the Neocutis Bio-gel a turn to see if I am happier with that product. A good product for your skin! Will order more. Love it My dermatologist suggested I use this product. I am very pleased with it. Thanks Fabulous cream for extremely dry, problematic skin.  Too expensive, but it seems to work.  Not sure if I will buy again. finishing up this first bottle  lasted 1&1/2  months so far........ since i use retin a and the hyluronic acid with it  its tough to see what its impact is as these products are already amazing  ..... i use it on top of both of those and like that it isn't a greasy or shine finish... drys real fast and at this point i already have another bottle ready to go on with my trial..... yes i think it does compliment my other products and would recommend it...  and whats the price to pay to have healthy young looking skin..... Nice product...great price! Good product I've tried way too many creams on my way to this one, but here I'll stay.  It's subtle, doesn't work overnight, but I'm seeing much clearer and smoother skin wherever I apply it, and some dark spots are fading... Wonderful product. Great price and fast service This is a great moisturizer for men as well.  If you are like me your skin gets oily later int he day.  I find this product to keep you skin fresh, non-oily all day long.  This product is usually sold in physician offices, but buy from Amazon.  Much cheaper. All I can say is ""why can't we make a product of this quality in the USA.""  This is a product developed in Sweden. I was introduced to it by my Dr. after having a laser treatment. I have very thin skin with lots of fine lines. This product has saved my skin texture.  Forget all your other over the counter JUNK. This is the real deal and an investment in your skin. The 1.69 ounce lasts about 6 months and should be used sparingly.  I laugh everytime I see the ads on TV for the newest GIMMICK that can't even penetrate your skin surface much less repair it. This is one of my favorite beauty items.  I was afraid that it would be too heavy for me, but my skin has never looked better!  I am 46 years old, and I am constantly asked what I use on my skin.  This is one of my must haves! I have been using Neocutis Biorestorative Cream with Psp for years. . It smoothes my skin - lessening fine wrinkles, pores, and discoloration.  I was introduced to it by my dermatologist and for a couple of years, I purchased from her. Now I buy from Amazon and save a bunch. It is the exact product the dermatologist sells. I have never had any concerns about expiration dates or authenticity. Recently I had laser treatment on some red blood vessels from my rosacea, and IPL for background redness the same day.  The visible capillaries around my nostrils blistered - those must have been closer to the surface than the ones on my cheeks (or perhaps the seb derm irritation around my nostrils caused the blistering).For the first few days after having the work done I used an over the counter, anti-bacterial product called polysporin.  During the day I hid the bruising and tried to cover the blisters with a combination of the whitest dermablend leg and body cream then coverblend in a shade that matches my skin on top of that, followed by powder.When this product arrived in the mail from Amazon I switched from the antibacterial polysporin to this.  The Biorestorative Cream seemed to speed up the healing around my nose and may or may not have sped up the fading of the bruises on my cheeks (normal result of having the under the surface blood vessels destroyed).The dermatologist said I could go back to using 0.025% tretinoin (the generic version of Retin A) one week after the laser and IPL treatments.  The first night that I used the tretinoin I waited an hour after applying it, and then put a light coating of the Biorestorative Cream over it.The next morning I had NO peeling - none, zip, nada!  I have ALWAYS had peeling skin the morning AFTER using the tretinoin- even though I'm on a low dose. I am thrilled to have something that can go on my skin on top of the tretinoin and reduce the peeling. I had cut back to 2 or 3 times a week with the tretinoin due to the peeling and hope to now be able to use it every night with this Biorestorative applied an hour later. I wouldn't put them on at the same time for fear of reducing the effectiveness of the tretinoin.I've been using the Neocutis Lumiere eye cream for a year.  I have very minor wrinkles around my eyes and honestly can't tell if it has really made a difference there or not. But I use a very small amount so on an annual basis isn't isn't expensive and may help me avoid deeper wrinkles as I get older.  Noteably, I have had no irritation of my eyes from the Lumiere eye cream and my eyes are pretty sensitive. I am in my mid-forties and live in an extremely dry climate.  This product moisturizes very well without feeling greasy.  My skin is soft and looks more supple since I've been using it (about 3 months).  It is the only product that I have found that makes my hormone-induced malasma nearly disappear for most of the day. As long as I keep using the product, it stays VERY faint. This is a controversial product since it uses PSP stem cells.  I have been happy with it. It has smoothed the transition from my orbital eye bone to the skin underneath my eyes. When you age, you have face section separation. The eye area separates from your cheeks. Your cheeks separate from your mouth. These factors make you look older. This product allows the production of collagen and improves the appearance of the skin. I got a bottlenecks n March, I was on vacation and I decide to try after that time.. Well , I had beautiful skin now after using this .. I got little bumps and red skin.. My face itch after I used..Of course , I was thinking maybe is just me that input too much or so. I try for a week and is being horrible.I want to like it was recommended mended to me but.. Now I have to tossed in the garbage .. And my skin is raw... The aesthetician, R.N., at the dermatologist's office initially recommended this product to me and thus gained my undying gratitude.  Just a thin layer applied at night appreciably changed the ""character"" of my skin, doing so in short order.  Sebum buildup (blackheads, whiteheads, enlarged pores) showed improvement from the first week of use, and now that I'm on my second 1.69 oz. pump-bottle and apply the cream twice daily, the good effects include visible reduction in fine-wrinkle appearance.FYI:  Applied under sunscreen products and/or makeup seems to result in a smoother, more finished look.  Highly recommended. I'm in my twenties and I'm a huge believer in prevention over curative treatments. I wasn't expecting much, I genetically have thin, dark skin under my eyes even though I'm fair-skinned and young. After a few weeks of using this eye cream twice a day, I have to say, it was money well-spent. I know nothing will permanently remove all of my dark circles but this helps fade them. It's made a noticeable difference in my face. For someone that usually throws cheap products away, I have to say this is a bit pricey for me but it was worth every penny. I'll be buying more. It works. It REALLY works. The Neocutis line was recommended to me by my dermatologist, & i bought the night cream and journee day cream at the office..have been using those religiously along with a compounded retin-a type thing they sell...that was about 6 weeks ago, and I have seen pretty dramatic results. Just ordered the eye balm after trying some samples. FYI I am a youthful 47 year old former sun goddess with olive skin. I'm sold. Absolutely love this product.  I found this site and it is 1/2 the regular price that I have been paying at my dermatologist's office.  I can now use it twice a day instead of trying to make it last and using it sparingly. Thank you so much.  I will be purchasing it again if it is still available. J I've been using Neocutis for over a year now. I am 46, going on 47 and would say that the Neocutis system is simple to use (only 4 steps in the morning and another 4 at night). (1) Cleanse (however, I use Obagi's facial cleanser b/c I prefer it over Neocutis'); (2) eye cream or balm (I use the cream); (3) BioSerum; (4) Journee Day Cream, SPF 30 in the AM and BioCream at night. My skin looks great for my age. On a side note, I read a review regarding Neocutis' use of an aborted boy baby for it's use in research in making their product line. It had me stunned, so I looked into it. Here's the skinny from my research, but please do your own. (1) They received a patch about the size of a postage stamp (this can be reproduced) to make a product that would help heal scarring of abused children/babies (burns, repeated beatings that removed the skin, etc. ). I saw the photos of the before, during and after. BREAKS your heart to see such abuse. (2) The boy baby was not viable. Now, I have had six pregnancies where the baby (fetus) was not viable. For me it meant that they had died (heart stopped and they quit growing). Except for my most recent one (went through labor, etc.), the others were all medically classified as ""aborted"" fetus'. Disturbing to read on your insurance benefits summary; however, medically speaking spontaneous abortion and miscarriage are the same. (4) Neocutis used their findings to create their skincare line. (4) In summary, this was not an aborted unwanted baby. This was a baby who was wanted, but the parents signed off on his use for research hoping something good could come out of something so sad. I, too, have donated two my of six babies. These products were purchased first as a sample set from the medi-spa for post treatment after a series of ""Vampire"" facials.The Neocutis brand is delivered by Obaji. Arrived as promised.  I have been using this cream for a couple of years.  I have sensitive skin and this cream doesn't cause any breakout. Had to return because the pump was broken and I was unable to get product out of the container.  I've bought this before and am very satisfied with the product overall. Perfect cream for people with sensitive skin...it isn't too heavy so it doesn't clog your pores but it least your face feeling moist and flexible Neocutis has made a product that really helps me with my rosacea and doesn't aggravate my skin - a win/win! Was a bit skeptical but now I love this product!!  My skin has a new glow and the wrinkles have diminished (at least temporarily).  Was using another manufacturer's product, roughly same price, but am convinced that this one is better and will definitely order again. Excellent product. Does not have fragrance, which I need, and doesn't make my eyes irritated. Many creams irritate my eyes even if I don't put it around my eyes. This is a keeper and I will continually order it. This is my second bottle of this cream. I've tried several products from Sephore, Nerium and a few others and this is the BEST cream ever. I have seen fine lines decrease in appearance, its lightweight and people have noticed how radient my skin looks. I will never buy anything else I use both the serum and moisturizer. My one and only complaint is the pump. On both of my bottles, the pump has broken. This was most likely due to being packed and unpacked. Pretty bottle, but not so serviceable. Contents still the best so Im giving it 5 stars. I've used this product for years, recommended by my dermatologist. It's amazing. Seriously. I've never used anything that worked so well. People compliment my skin all the time. Sure, some of that is genetics but this product has definitely helped me stave off the march of time across my face. It really helps with texture and gives a glow.Try it. So worth the price. Note to Neocutis: I imagine many of your users are over 40yo so please consider some variance in your packaging or better typeface with increased contrast. Presbyopia is real and unavoidable. If other users are like me and don't wear reading glasses when washing their face it is unnecessarily difficult to tell the difference between a Luminere bottle or Biorestorative Cream. I cannot express enough how much I love this product.  Creamy, but absorbs quickly.  Dermatologist said it was important to add growth factor and gave me this to try.  LOVE it. Please spare me the rhetoric about abortions.  That said...I am a 50+ guy that has always had problem skin; oily, acne, rosacea, and numerous other unexplained skin problems.  Frankly, I have not really ever done much about it.  I have always avoided almost all products, including soaps, as everything seemed to make it worse.I discovered Neocutis products.  I now wash my face twice a day with their mild face wash, which is absolutely wonderful.  I put on their bio-restorative cream at night, and their bio-restorative cream mixed with some Rosac (rosacea cream with sunscreen) in the morning.  At age 50+ my skin has never looked this good or been this problem free.I would highly recommend Neocutis products. I had a mini face and neck lift almost 3yrs ago and following the removal of sutures I starting using the bio creme on the scars immediately ..today I have no visible scars except a few behind my ears that I could not see and therefore did not treat...this product s remarkable...I recommended it to my neice who had  double mastectomy and she is so appreciative that I told her about this amazing product. I purchase it through my dermatologist because I know that it is good and not expired or sat in a sales reps car for awhile....also they will stand behind it if for some reason it does not agree with me. all in all a wonderful product!!! I love this product. It goes on so smooth and you don't need much. I have only been using it for 2 weeks and can see a difference already. Good Stuff! One of the best products on the market :) product is good and price is reasonable. Love this product. Very moisturizing!! I have some problems with rosacea and my doctor gave me samples of a couple of different creams to try.  I decided on Neocutis and have been using it for a few weeks now.  My skin was quite dry previous to using it and it's in much better shape now.  I've added the eye cream, cleanser and gel to my daily regimen and am very optimistic.I've tried a number of high end department store lines and didn't have great luck with any of them.  This line is much less expensive than many I've tried and, while it's certainly not inexpensive, I'll happily pay to get these results.  Obviously, I can't give any long term results and I'm always skeptical as to exactly how much any cream can do.  But, my skin is clearly very happy with this line so, I'm sticking with it.I trust the doctor who recommended this line and I'm grateful to finally find something that is working so well.  Between cold weather and indoor heat, my skin prior to starting with Neocutis skin cream was feeling dry and irritated.  Neocutis has a pleasant scent (to me) and I wake up with soft, moisturized skin.  If you can get a sample first, that's always ideal since one cream doesn't fit all needs.  But, this one is a definite winner for me! Love it!!!! I'm in my late 40's and have very sensitive skin with rosacea, which includes acne even after menopause.  This product works great for my skin - no more breakouts and it's helping decrease the lines around my mouth and eyes.  I tried using this with Finacea gel, but I broke out less with just the Bio Cream, and it really helps to reduce the redness.  It's moisturizing, but not greasy.  My plastic surgeon recommended it after a breast reconstruction surgery, to help reduce the scarring - it works well for that too. The med spa that I go to recommended this for my scars that I got from surgery. He showed me pictures of burn victims and after 6 months you couldn't even tell they had been burnt. You have to use it right away and everyday preferably twice a day. This NeoCutis skin cream is wonderful.  A little bit goes a long way but you must spread it quickly because the skin absorbs it with no greasiness at all.  It was prescribed to me after my face lift and now it is all I will use.  Buying through Amazon.com was the best way;  it came quickly and in excellent condition. Very good value for a very good skin product. The luminere eye cream works miracles as well. This is a great product. Could not be happier"
B003040T0Y," best soap feels great does the job. Great natural cleanser. Feels like it has very fine exfoliant properties. I feel very clean after washing with this. I really like this product, it is working well with my oily skin. I do not have acne so I can’t say how well it helps with that but it is great to use it right after a shave. Does the job for us guys...only use 2-3 times a week!!! Absolutely the best I've ever used. My husband likes this cleanser. It is gentle. Great product, wish it was available for Prime. My husband uses this and I just love the smell, I wish they made it for women!! Love this soap.  Light and easy scent.  Just need literally a drop - it goes a long way.  I usually get pimples but this is clean and clear.  Iced also used their scrub, eye cream, and mask thing.  All A+ Wonderful product as it helps great as part of your regimen, in conjunction with the other Kyoku Daily wash or stand alone. Only problem I had was that the first product came in leaked but Amazon replaced it in no time. I will not ding points on this product just because of that. Make sure you check your packaging when you receive it. Have been used this product for over 5 years ,loved it My skin feels great every time I use it! So far so good. I've used it for about a week now. I can see the difference. Be warned though, it'll make your face dry if you more than one topical product. I used this product once and immediately loved it. It smells nice and you can feel it cleaning. Afterwards I followed up with an acne lotion (oil-free) and my face has never felt so clean and soft let alone the physical appearance of my skin looked tighter and younger. Will buy again!!Side note: I use Dove Men's face lotion in the morning for all day protection. Additionally, I use an exfoliating cleanser twice a week along with Kyoku Lava Masque (must by, will not regret) twice a week. Skin looks and feels better now than ever! I've used this product for over a year and I'm always happy with the results.  It definitely has helped me with keeping pimples and blackheads at bay. This is Step one of my new skin care routine right before exfoliating it helps prep the surface as it where and opens up my pores and skin for deeper cleaning and repair. If your just now getting started with taking care of your skin Id recommend getting right to it. You will thank yourself not only 10 years from now but more likely 10 days from now. Great daily cleanser, leaves face refresh rejuvenated and invigorating. I really enjoyed it. I just wish they made a bigger size of this. I own so many different daily washes and this hands down has been one of my favorite. I would recommend for someone who wants a daily facial cleaner. Accidently ordered this. I was looking for the exfloiating scrub instead I recieced this. Very smooth and lather based cream. Has a small minty smell to it. It truly does feel like it is nourshing your face and deep cleaning. Works as intended. Been using this cleanser for 2 weeks now and I noticed that my skin feels tighter and there are less blemishes on my face. Would buy another one for stock. This cleanser has a clean masculine scent. A small amount goes a long way. A pencil eraser sized dollop easily produces enough lather to do both my face and neck. Skin is squeaky clean after use and much less oily in between uses. Some of the best stuff I have ever used, this is amazing and smells great. It cleans your skin without the extremely dry feeling of most cleansers. Love it This is some of the best face cleaner  for men that I have found --- very good 1-2 times per week -- I recommend this Works well with my skin. Doesn't cause irritation. I use it twice a day and it seems to be really clearing my skin up. I bought this for my boyfriend - he loves it and I find myself using it too!  You need a very small amount to lather up your face and neck - nice smell and simple ingredients.  Leaves your skin feeling clean but not too dry.  Just buy it! This stuff has a great menthol feel/smell, is heavy enough to clean but not so heavy it feels gross or is hard to get off. Keeps my face feeling clean without being dry, and a little bit goes a long way. It's good  stuff. Just expensive. It is a brand I really like that first texture, I like the smell is delicate and pleasant. I am a regular customer of this brand I recommend Very good overall. Product works good. Like the smell and feel of it. A little bit goes a long way. I usually forget to use it daily though. I also use other Kyoku products. Seems good quality. I use Kyoku for Men Daily Facial Cleanser, 3.4 Fluid Ounce every other day in combination with Kyoku for Men Lava Masque, 5 Ounce (which i use 2x week) and my skin has never looked or felt better! I've tried tons of different combinations to remove blackheads and oily skin and Kyoku has provided a perfect lineup for me. Absolutely love this product, it actually works, smells great, cleans great. I use it once a day and my acne is gone and only reappears when I stop using these product for 1 week+ Got this for my husband but I use it all the time. I like it better than my cleanser. It smells so clean and has the best slip and rich lather. As they say in the Irish Spring commercial....""Manly, yes, but I like it too"" Great Great product has worked well for me This face wash is great.  It has a nice tingly feeling and smells like peppermint but doesn't burn or leave a scent.  Great for acne as well, I have less blemishes now and recommend to everyone.  I keep trying more kyoku products and have been very pleased by them all. Fantastic.  Cleans skin without leaving it dry or oily.  Use it before shaving for a really close, clean, smooth shave. Love this wash!!! Only use in the morning an it cleans me up really well as well as their lava masque and exfoliate every now and then keeps me clear!!! My acne has never been better Best stuff I've tried It's an excellent cleansers. It doesn't dry out my skin like most other products. Use it daily, notice less oils and fresh feeling throughout the day. Cleans and help prevent more blackheads from appearing Great product The best daily facial scrub for men on the market. Period. If you care about spending money on your personal skin care, you'll never go back to anything else Love this! It cleans very well but does not dry my skin out. I typically have very sensitive skin on my face, but this cleanser does a great job of balancing that out. Excellent! good for daily use.  keeps my skin clear. no breakouts. Felt the improvement to my skin immediately after the first application. I'm definitely going to be a lifelong customer very good Been using it for a moth. This stuff works really well. When I first used it my face felt super clean.! this is the product that give me what I looking for.smells nice.cleans you're pores.fresh and not leaving dry sensation. is a great product, at the beginning is a little bit strong for the face, but after a while, I see the difference. Bought this for my 15 year old son along with the facial scrub and moisturiser. has done wonders for his skin. I've tried the scrub and I love it! Leaves my skin so soft. Works great! What a nice pleasant scent. Leaves the skin feeling clean and fresh without drying. A little goes a long way. I will definitely buy again. Great product. It only takes a very small nut so it lasts quite long. This is an excellent daily facial cleanser.  It can be used everyday without reddening or drying out your skin.  Does a great job at removing dead skin and oil from your face. good These products have been my go to since I purchased their gift box set back in 2012. I use all of their line now. Great cleanser and very nice scent that's refreshing. I have used Kyoku's daily facial cleanser for over six months and the results have been terrific. As with any facial cleanser, you run the risk of drying out your skin. Kyoku products have never dried out my face. Prior to Kyoku facial cleanser, I used several sensitive skin cleansers with results ranging from non-existent to mediocre. This facial cleanser is the first to meet expectations.The cleanser has 0.5% salicylic acid to treat acne. I supplement the cleanser with an acne spot treatment when I get acne. Overall, this facial cleanser does a great job preventing breakouts.I recommend using the facial cleanser daily and the Kyoku Exfoliating Facial Scrub twice weekly. The two paired together keeps my face clear. Great so far it's so good. Great thank you! Love everything about the Kyoku line I love this product! Feels awesome in my face. Usually means my skin feeling fresh. I love this face wash.  It smells great and is not harsh at all. Gave this as a gift and he likes it! As man, I don't quite understand difference Facial Cleanser. So give a 5 star anyway. This is a great cleanser for woman to. Really cleans your face well.  It's good to switch off to a scrub., this company has a good one. After I wash I use a small amount of non-oily moisturizer. This product leaves your face so clean and a tad dry, but if you wait about 5 min after washing the dry feeling will go away. Overall great product! Smells great. Good size for a dopp kit. Leaves your face clean but not dried out. Great product Very good stuff! Brilliant value product The best I used so far! Great stuff! My face feels great with this cleanser! Nice stuff My husband loves this and it seems to be a great sensitive cleaner for his face! Absolutely as described and more! Everyone who's on the fence try this now! You will not be disappointed at all! Best daily facial cleanser I have ever used, best part is this product doesn't make your skin feeling all dry like some other products do. It only takes a small amount and leaves your face feeling great. No dryness or redness, but a pore opening feeling that feels refreshing. It throughly cleans your face and smells good. But it may dries your skin in winter. Overall, i like this facial wash. My husband love it I like the way this cleans my face without drying.  Only takes a little.  I will buy again and again. fresh oil free face, I'd recommend it to a friend Great cleanser!! The effect is very good and great is a little expensive. But I still really like, I will buy them. I've tried a few cleansers and this one takes the cake. Love the scent and goes on and washes off well. Bang for your buck for a designer-caliber cleanser. face is so fresh after using it My new favorite cleanser awesome product This is quite certainly the best face wash I have ever used, and I have used many. I suppose I am lucky to even have found this line really. I have not heard much about kyoku, but it is a line people need to get more acquainted with. This does not over dry my face like so many that claim they wont, do. It also makes my face look great and gives it a healthy glow. One added bonus is the smell of this stuff, it is incredible. I have never smelled anything like it before and it is very unique. It lasts a long time as well; a small pea sized bit is all you need. Buy this! OH my God!  I love this stuff!  The smell is amazing, and it makes my face feel amazing! Husband LOVES this and says one of the best products. He heard the price was going up because he heard you were going to have to buy directly from the company so he stocked up! I've been using Kyoku products for several months now (face wash, scrub, and lotion).  I've had horrible skin since 13(I'm in my 20's now) and tried it all:  Proactive, Accutane, SkinID, dermatologist prescribed creams, and off the shelf products.  Since implementing Kyoku products into my daily routine a few months ago my skin has improved tenfold.  I couldn't imagine using anything else now.  Daily I use: Kyoku Facial Cleanser > Anthony Logistics Toner Pads > Kyoku Face Lotion.  Once a week I'll use the Kyoku Face Scrub directly after the Kyoku Facial Cleanser and Menscience Face Mask (I'll try the Kyoku Lava Masque once this runs out). it's great, no dry skin, but I use their moisturizer too I am 40 years old and just recently began to use product on my skin.  I must say that this cleanser is truly the real deal.  My skin looks clean and the application is so easy and refreshing.  You literally only need a pea size amount to cleanse the whole face.  Yes, definitely my new cleanser!!!!  Thank you Kyoku! UPDATE.... While I still will rate this product as among the very best I have ever used, there is one concern I have when I recently returned for a repurchase....I bought this product several times at a price of only $8, and now it has skyrocketed to double what is was before. While this product is great, the utility value for price has been drastically lowered for me. I was one of the first to buy this product, and it seems the  popularity has encouraged them to increase the price....Can't blame them in that regard, but that won't stop me being sad about it. ORIGINAL REVIEW.....  I was pleasantly surprised by this product. It has acne fighting ingredients in smaller quantities for those who have more sensitive skin. It still works great in that regard, it is just a bit more soothing than others. The consistency and smell are awesome and very natural. The one negative I will give is that there is not a larger volume option available. Depending on how often you use this wash, you will find yourself running out quickly. Love this product. The whole Kyoku product line is great. When you use this with the mosturizer by Kyoku it makes your skin feel so good and less oily than others. I have never had a break out with this product and I only use it once a day in the morning. My face with other products usually doesn't react well and would either turn really red or dry. This product smells like a light mint smell (which doesn't last and goes away a couple minutes, usually before you get out of the shower) and a little portion goes a long way. Defiantly worth your money. This product really helps get your face back to a healthy glow. It will clean and moisturize you face. It's a must have product for everyone. Great cleaner.  Cuts the grime without over drying.  Very little needed so it last forever.  Very bubbly I've been using this face wash for a year now. It's one of the beSt ones I've used! It's so effective. I even used other high end brands like Kiehls and Jack Black. Let me tell you this one is better. Don't spend more! Don't be cheap either I used to use neutrogena and it dried my skin. This is definitely staying in my line of skin care. Also I use the scrub and mask from this company. Treat your face right! Disclaimer: I used to use bar soap, clean and clear, and proactiv refining mask for my face (all shots in the dark being a guy who doesn't know anything about facial or skin care) until my girl recommended an exfoliator.  I usually drink coffee and stay stressed out all day at work and sometimes it comes through on my face in maybe 3-4 pimple breakouts on a stressful week, but I wouldn't say I have acne problems or an ""oily"" face.  I didn't realize what I was missing out on, this stuff makes my skin feel tight and clean for almost the entire day.  It cleared up any acne I had, and I've yet to have any breakouts except for people breaking out to complement my flawless skin (haha jk).  It really does work however, I'm buying for life. Kyoku facial products have been my favorite ever since I started using them. Great to find products that are specifically for mens facial needs. They used to be over priced but recently became more reasonable. I love the way that this cleanser gets rid of all the gunk off of my face without making it feel dried out. It also has a good natural scent to it. I always have problems with acne in the summer because I work outside and sweat a lot. This product is amazing at clearing it up and keeping it away. Amazing product that I would recommend to anyone looking for a great facial cleanser that is natural and works. Good quality. Product was shipped and received very quickly. Box and tube in excellent condition, unopened. Product is very good. I'm becoming a big fan of kyoku products.  Would absolutely buy again. It gives a refreshing feeling and my wife and barber noticed the difference.  I always thought soap and water and you were clean.  I never noticed any problem with my face but my wife and barber noticed.  My Barber would hit me with a scrub every time I went in (every three weeks)  My wife suggested I try one at home along with this Facial Cleaner and it feels refreshing and my wife and barber have noticed the change in my skin.  I use the whole Kyoku line and since then I have not had dry or damaged skin anymore.  I guess my face was probably dry or something but the rest of my skin was so jacked up i didn't notice.  I tell you having skin that feels normal again is awesome.  (I live in a harsh climate and swim five days a week so I really do a number on my skin. This is the only product that I have found that takes care of my skin.)"
B00SETTZGE," My face is addicted to this product! Just got your product and started using it daily. So far it works nicely leaving my face feeling clean. Rugged and Dapper facial scrub has really smoothed my skin. It also doesn't irritate my skin like some other products I've tried. I get compliments all the time. I highly recommend this product. This is an excellent product. It has not been a week yet since I started using in and I can feel the diference in my face.Thanks a lot... I began using the product the day after I received it and I love it. I believe that I see a real difference in my skin. I will have no problem recommending this product!! Wish it weren't so expensive though. Feel like is working, after cleaning the skin is smoother and after few days some dark spot is lighter. Good product. Will buy again I have sensitive skin, this face was is great! I switched from dermalogica, a $70 face was to this with no issues! My face is clear and skin in hydrated. I would recommend using a moisturizer after though because it does a good job at cleaning deep. I use the moisturizer this company makes as well. Great face wash! Highly recommend! I’ve bought the product several times! My husband loves this face wash! It really works into all of the stubble (and under his beard). It seems to last him quite a while too. It’s nice that he has a go-to flash wash designed for men. This is my first time using this product and i'm very impress, it doesn't cause my face to dry out, my face do not get as oily as they get before. And I love the fact that natural. I just wish is a little cheaper. I've been using this for a little over a week and done the face mask twice.  I'm thrilled with the results.  I would highly recommend this product line. I have had trouble with acne for the last 13 years and have tried everything. This face wash has been the only thing that has controlled and stopped breakouts. I will continue buying! Bought this product twice now and have finally decided to give it 5 stars. I mean how do you really know how good it is unless you want to wash 1/2 your face with a different product. What I can say is that before using it, I'd get a pimple now and then using a variety of other products; but since using it, not one pimple ever. Coincidence? Probably not. So I'll keep using it. A great way to cleanse the skill and feel refreshed. I can't tell for sure, but it seems like it's helping make shaving much easier too. I've never been a guy who really cared about this type of stuff but I'm very active and this stuff works great to keep my face clean. I use it in combination with their face lotion and it leaves my face feeling incredibly smooth and clean. My girlfriend loves it, so I love it. Will buy again. I have sensitive skin.  This facial scrub has been doing a great job of gently cleaning without ripping through my skin abrasively.  The fragrance is fresh and masculine.  Highly recommend this wash! So far I like it. The smell is pleasant without being overpowering and doesn't linger after you finish. I appreciate this because I hate strong smelling soaps that linger on my face. Also a little better value than some subscription service products that I also like. I have an oily face that constantly has ingrown hairs underneath my skin after shaving because of my Native American and black background. There's only one other product that has ever helped heal my face and prevent irritation. However, this is the only product that is a face wash/cleanser. It leaves my face feeling refresh and healthy but my favorite is the healing and prevention of ingrown hairs. 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾 Boyfriend loves it. Simple and quick wash in the shower! Will buy again. I have gotten this for my son who has/had acne problems and he is telling me he loves it and it helps very much I tried all the so called mens products but fellas this is all you need from now on!!! Clearer face,tighter skin with smoother feeling to the touch!! I ordered this product because I wanted to reduce the amount of flaky skin on my face. This is the first facial cleanser I have purchased in my entire life and I'm really satisfied with the product. I use this product every time I shower and feel very refreshed when I come out. The product smells nice and it doesn't irritate my skin. I've been using this product for about a week now and I'm already noticing a huge difference on my face.  Overall I feel clean and my face is smooth. I highly recommend this product and will be buying again. I have searched my whole life for a face wash that cleans my greasy face and washes off clean and fresh.  This is the best I've found so far.  I'm not saying it is perfect - still haven't found that one yet - but this is by far the best so far.  I wish it was a little cheaper, but I know that there are scrubs much more expensive than Rugged & Dapper.  Highly recommended.  (By the way, ladies, my wife HATES this face wash.  She doesn't like the smell or the texture.  So it's all mine.) Little pricy but my husband likes it a lot and since January I keep purchasing it thru Amazon really like it smells very good and fresh This is my first face moisturizer since I've never had any skin problems before. That being said, 5 stars is my vote because it really did make my skin a lot softer. Smells great and my fiance enjoys it so far. Will update later after some use. EXCELLENT! My face continues to be noticeably less oily than it was throughout the day after just two days of use plus it does a great job exfoliating and not leaving my face dry or tight. The moisturizer is also amazing, no shine no flakes. Neither caused me any acne or irritation. Excellent product. I hear a lot of reports stating how the micro beads sometimes go thru or damage the filters, is this true?However the product does exactly what it's supposed to do, I use a very small amount and that works great for me. I have been using this for about a month. This is a perfect complement to the ""Age + Damage Defense Facial Moisturizer For Men"" also by Rugged & Dapper. I like thata) It is gentle enough to use twice a dayb) It is made from natural ingredientsc) It thoroughly cleans without over drying the face.d) It has significantly reduced shaving irritation, instead of increasing it, like the other scrubs I have tried.I go to the gym during my lunch break and I absolutely love the fact that I only have to carry two bottles with me  :) Use this wash in the shower before shaving. Leaves my face and forehead clean and smooth. Use with good men’s face moisturizer and my skin looks vibrant. Just used this product for the first time. It has an amazing scent, the beads aren't sharp and the amount of beads is just right so applying this product to my face felt very comfortable. Love how it left a cooling sensation on my face and wasn't overly-drying. Definitely one of the better products. I have a few breakouts around my cheek area, neck and forehead, so hopeful this product will help to clear them up. Smells great and leaves my face/skin feeling clean and refreshed. I use this as part of a facial regimine with a couple other products and really works well! The cleanser feels soft to touch on the skin, yet the pearly grains makes me feel like i'm really scrubbing my face without applying too much pressure. My face does feel clean without feeling too dry, and it does not add extra time to my daily routine and I recommend it as a product. While most guys either don't admit or actually don't use extra products for personal hygiene and cleansing, this a great product to keep in the bathroom. Makes face feel good.  A little goes a long way. Face feels protected. This is the best face wash I have used, period.  I have tried many other products from basic over the counter to high end department store brands.  Rugged & Dapper's power scrub, when combined with the moisturizer, has been the best for keeping acne at bay and my face feeling moist and refreshed.  I use it twice a day and have found best results that way.  Again, great product and I highly recommend it! Love it, I can feel dead skin wash away, leaving me with a smooth clean face, doesn't over dry or leave residue. Great quality will last a while, as all you need is a very small amount. Only face wash that works for my husband. It helps him with ingrown hairs from shaving. Great product! After many failed attempts at trying to find a face cleaner, I had just about given up. Then Rugged And Dapper enters my life!!!! Simply the best face scrub a man can have. I have to say after one use i quickly ordered another bottle to have on standby. The smell is great. Not that medicine smell most face scrubs have. Most importantly, it doesn't dry out your face like most other men's face scrubs tend to do. So do yourself a favor, and dump the epic fails that are face scrubs and get with Rugged And Dapper. You will not be sorry!! I've been using the Rugged & Dapper Daily Power Scrub Facial Cleanser for a while now, and I have to say.. I really love this product. I appreciate that it uses natural and certified organic ingredients, and I can feel that it is easier on my skin, yet tough on oil and dirt. The scrub leaves my face looking clean and fresh with every use. I definitely recommend this product! I finally found a product to clear some of the scars from blackheads and tighten the pores.Great product so far and will order another when I run out. After one week of using this, my complexion is a lot better and the roughness around my forehead is gone. I have sensitive skin , so I wasn't sure how my skin would react to this product, but I glad to say there is no burning or stinging after using it.  I am very picky with face wash products and what the drug stores offer wasn't helping.  All in all, I'm glad I found R&D and it is highly likely, I will purchase it again.Thank you,Jose. My ""rugged & dapper"" husband loved this product. He wears a beard and has pretty large pores most likely attributed to his ""hairiness"". Well, he was very pleased with how his skin felt after using it and the refreshing smell would give him a nice ""pick me up"" too. Our only disappointment was when we accidentally left it behind in a hotel bathroom in Vegas :(....there's one lucky man out there that was able to keep practically a full bottle for free :'(. We'll most likely be ordering again. Husband absolutely loves this face scrub. good product, but arrived with damage to protective seal, product leaking in boxUpdate - R&D contacted me and replaced the bottle, no questions ask. Very satisfied Good scrub to take that extra oil of your face. It may be the best facial scrub I have ever used. Even though its a scrub it doesn't feel harsh and my skin feels so smooth afterwards. It is doing wonders for my face. It feels like I am taking great care of my skin and it shows. People are also telling me how good I look, and the best part is, I don't even need them to tell me. The results speak for themselves. I am so grateful for this wonderful organic product line! I like this face wash.  I have oily skin so wanted something that would help me look and feel fresh.  This does the job.  I use it in the AM and before going out. I'm enjoying it! If things go South, I'll let you all know!!! I have been dealing with mild - moderate acne since high school and I was looking for a face wash that I could use daily, sometimes up to 3 times a day, and not leave my skin irritated and dry, but still be strong enough to eradicate any pimples that may arise. Compared to other brands such as Clearasil, Clean & Clear, and all the other store-bought brands I have tried, Rugged & Dapper has not only cleared my acne FASTER, but also has left my face softer and allows me to use it as much as I need to keep my face clean throughout the day! Not only that, but it smells so good you'll want to rub it on your face immediately.  The scrub has tiny particles that help exfoliate the face, and it is all organic (including the salicylic acid!), and barely stings the eyes if some gets in.TL;DR - Rugged & Dapper has produced a wonderful daily exfoliating face wash that not only treats acne but smells freaking amazing and leaves your face soft and nice (right after you rise it off you can tell the difference!). Will definitely be purchasing again. I like this facial scrub because it gives me a nice refreshing feeling as NIVEA MEN Energy Face Scrub Foaming Gel, 4.4 oz Tube without all the alcohol that dries out my face. Very nice product, would buy again. I am 36 and my skin is finally starting to show signs of aging :( I have tried many high end products and this is the best one so far. Great exfoliant but something you can use everyday, nice smell, doesn't over dry, and whips up to a nice lather. I will be using this as long as it's around. I bought the mask but this does such a great job that I barely use it. I do use the moisturizer at night. This is the only face wash that has worked for me. I was a bit skeptical at first due to the amount of reviews that were given by people who were given a free sample or a discounted price. The face wash smells great,it did not dry out my skin at all, and I have seen good results. I have very sensitive skin and in past years I have tried a ton of products. I even stopped my search for a few months. Excellent Product, Highly Recommended!! This is actually really good stuff. I'm normally pretty picky on what I put on my face but I haven't had any issues with this. It doesn't over-dry my face and I love how this makes my skin feel. I guess there's a reason why you guys have so many good ratings. Great product from Rugged and Dapper! Every time I use the product, my face feels fresh and clean and the scent has a nice masculine smell to it. This cleanser is certainly a high quality product and works to keep your face looking clean and well kept. Follow up with a facial moisturizer for best results. Although they may have a facial moisturizer, I suggest using a facial moisturizer with SPF as their facial moisturizer does not have SPF (but it may be optimal for nighttime use). I bought this for my boyfriend based on its overwhelmingly positive reviews. He absolutely loves it! He says that it is more exfoliating than a normal face scrub. No skin irritation, and he says he just feels like it gives him a really great deep clean. No complaints at all! I will definitely keep getting this for him. pretty good, it have some little thing like sand, it is very comfortable when you wash your face. Great product! I have sensitive skin, but also have had issues with blemishes, zits, blackheads etc for quite some time.  I've never had a product that was as effective as Rugged & Dapper, and it doesn't dry my skin out like many of the more intense products I've used.  The price is obviously higher than many of the off-the-shelf stuff you'd find at most stores, but it works, and the ingredient list looks outstanding.  Would definitely recommend. Very amazing product! I bought it for my boyfriend and it’s amazinng! Very amazing smell, and he loves the clay mask! I’m so happy I bought this for him! Great facial wash for men.  I will buy again. Great exfoliating face wash. I grew tired of the store bought stuff and had my wife help me choose a good face wash on Amazon. I've used this for about 2 weeks and I love how well it exfoliates my face, neck and shoulders. I also use R&D moisturizing face lotion for after the shower. Great combination! Product cleans pores better than anything I have ever used. Gentle on the skin, but does the job very well! I would highly recommend this to anyone of any skin type. Purchased for the most ""manly"" guy I know as a stocking stuffer. He is very particular about scents in product and he actually stated that he loved it. The product itself worked well. It's clean and lightweight, no residue and I'm sure we will need to reorder because he is enjoying using it. I love this cleanser!  I've tried many over the years, and this is the stand out. It cleanses, exfoliates, and tones  in a way no others do.  Sure, it is a bit pricey, but it is worth it. I just used this product today and I got it in the morning. My face doesn't feel dry for once after using this new face wash and I am glad the beads are biodegradable since the traditional beads cause major environmental degradation to marine and river life in general. I wish the smell is a bit more tone down it smells very strong. This is an excellent product!  I did my research and found the reviews to be positive, so I tried it myself.I responded very quickly and liked it.  I will be a regular purchaser.  Thanks! I have used a few scrubs over the past few months and none really seemed to do the trick until I came across this product. My face is rather sensitive to most cleansers and often leaves my face red or my skin completely dried out. This stuff is great and you really feel the difference. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is having bad luck with their current cleanser. This is my second order. I had low expectations but I liked what I read about this face scrub. It does what it says it should do. I have always had both oily areas on and around my nose and dry flaky patches on my forehead and cheeks. I work with someone who is also an esthetician. She noticed my face no longer had dried out patches or overly oily areas and asked what I was doing different. That alone convinced me this stuff work was working. This is a great product!  I had been using a different facial cleanser for years before learning about and trying this one. Now that I have been using for a couple of weeks the changes I can honestly say I will never go back.  It smelt and felt better immediately, and my skin feels better after using it too.I had a minor problem with the pump not working, emailed Rugged & Dapper and they took care of the issue immediately.  Would recommend… Bought the cleanser and the Rugged and Dapper facial cleansing spin brush for my son.  He loves themThank you I'm a senior citizen with cyclic skin problems, plus sensitive skin.Used with the complete kit, this product is the only one that not only controls skin problems, but actually corrects moderate acne scarring.I wasn't expecting that. So, imagine my surprise and delight.This is now my daily routine. I bought this for my son and his skin looks amazing now I have always hated using face wash but it's a necessity as I have extra oily skin.  But I actually look forward to using this in the shower when I get up every morning and before bed every night.  It leaves my skin amazingly smooth and makes for a fantastic pre-shave scrub to make sure you get as close a shave as possible.  Yes it's a little pricey at $25 but it is worth every penny in my opinion, and I'll be ordering again and again. I had light acne in highschool and college, nothing serious, but at 24 I had worse acne than ever before. I tried a number of things but after using this for the past month morning and night as well as thier Detoxifying Mineral Clay Mask once a week, acne is gone. I use this after brushing my teeth in the morning and night, the mask on Sunday night. Make it part of a routine, stick to it and it works great. Skin feels refreshed and no more acne. Nothing negative to say whatsoever. This is good stuff. I have been using it for about 10 days and I'm pleased with the results. It suds up good and rinses off easily. The exfoliating beads are noticeable but gentle. My face looks and smells fresh after use. I really like that it multi purpose--it's very simple and saves time. It is an 8 oz bottle too so it should last a while. This stuff really does work. I will say I don't break out often, however I do always begin to feel small little bumps forming. This scrub makes those bumps vanish in a day. I like the smell as well. As a guy I hate fruity smelling facial washes and this stuff has a decent smell but not a girly smell if you get me. I will continue to purchase this item glad I found it. I wanted a mild exfoliating face wash that smelled good and didn't have any crazy ingredients. This fits the bill perfectly. Not drying,pleasant smell, and leaves my face feeling smooth. I don't really see any evidence of the to or effect, but that's not what I was looking for anyway. Highly recommended. This is very good stuff. I have struggled with various cleaners in the past, but not with this one. I has kept any new facial breakage from happening the last week since I have been using it daily in the morning and before bed. I would highly recommend this to anyone that has oily skin that tends to dry out quickly. The smell is very subtle and almost unnoticeable, but that is fine with me. This is my first buy.  Ur face will feel very comfortable&clean after wash.I think i will buy it again .  Highly recomment to everyone. Give it a try. I have used multiple cleansers in the past, this one was a great surprise!  I have rough dry skin and this product seem to work wonders on my skin.  I didn't start feeling or noticing the texture of my skin until about a couple weeks of use.  My skin is not as rough as it once was.  The size of the bottle is plenty for morning and nightly uses.  I will continue to use this product and will definitely purchase it again! Second time buying this and will buy again after I run out, I feel it's a bit pricey but I'm still paying for it because it seems worth it for my skin nature and very good.... you will refresh and clean after face wash and stay for longer time too..will buy it again I absolutely love my daily power scrub. It is not to harsh on my skin but it definitely cleans the surface as well as deep into the skin. I feel refreshed after every use and after a week I have seen my skin clear up and be more radiant. Would recommend this product to anyone Great scent. Just need a little drop and I'm sure the bottle wil last a long while. Doesn't make your skin too moist or dry. Would recommend it.. Probably the best face wash I've used. I have sensitive, but dry skin. Alot different than my oily skin in my teenage years. Now that I'm in my 30s I needed to find something that wouldn't dry out my skin or leave it oily and clog my pores, as I'm prone to breakouts still. This wash feels great and doesn't have a strong smell. Leaves my skin feeling clean and toned. Great product, and it's hard to explain but you can feel that it is a natural product. It's not full of inorganic material and my skin can tell the differences. Whether it is true or not it feels that my skin absorbs/takes in the product verses other store shelf brands I have tried. Most products I have tried usually break my face out and dry it out. This product does not. It leaves my face smooth, clear, and my complexion is great. Highly recommend  this product. This is the first thing I've ever used in 25 years that keeps my face clean and fresh. The struggle is no longer real. I have been searching for a while a product that can clean my face as well as soften by beard before I shave. I have used a lot of other products, but I really do enjoy this one. I wash my face morning and at night with this because I get a clean feeling on my face. I also do not have too use a lot either. From now on, I will continue to purchase this product for my face. I absolutely love Rugged & Dapper products. The Daily Power Scrub is one of the best cleansers I've come across. The best part is that I don't have to use threeither different products since it combines cleanser, scrub, and toner all into one bottle. On a side note, I love the bottle design it's very manly or should I say it's very Rugged and Dapper. Love the product it smells greats, the texture is perfect and my face looks and feels so much smoother and even. As dark skin man with sensitive skin it's hard to find a product that works with my skin type and this cleaner does just that. My face isn't right and dry after washing nor is the exfoliating texture too abrasive. Well worth the price for the size and how much is needed per use. Love the scrub and the scent. I use this daily in the shower after I shave and could not be more pleased.  It has a great scent and leaves my skin looking and feeling great.  Will be reordering. I really like the name, it stands out to me. My friends are curious about it now! lol I like the smell (similar to American Crew shampoo smell) and the consistency of the cleanser is very full. The cleanser can really scrub good all of the face and neck without needing to apply more than a nickel/quarter amount. Thank you for this great product! Helped reduce my husbands in grown hairs from shaving by tenfold. Very happy with this product and will become a staple in the home.. I have 2 boys who are coming up to the age where they will be using this product as well, so I am happy with results it provides and look forward to seeing the continued improvement. Excellent product ordered more to give to my son for Father's Day This stuff is fantastic. I wish they'd make a body wash comprised of a similar formula with the same great scent and slightly rough (but not too rough) consistency. I've been looking for the perfect face wash for a long time and I think I've finally found it in Rugged & Dapper. I was going to wait at least 1-2 weeks to write a review, but on day 3 this has made a big enough impression for me to say its probably the best product on the market, though i have only tried a few others. Made in USA organic ingredients, the only con is the price but you definitely get what you pay for. Keep on making excellent products R&D! I love this! Even though this is slightly on the expensive side it's totally worth it. The scrubs in there makes my face feel so much cleaner every morning. My face also feels more moisturized through the day than the old facial washes I've used before. Started to worry at first! My face started to have a slight burning sensation once I applied the mask. Turns out that is normal and after a few min it went away. Once I washed it off after the required time to leave on. My face felt smooth and clean. I haven't felt my face like that in a long time! expensive but indeed very good. Great product that makes my face feel clean and less oily. I like that it doesn't dry my face out. A lite bit goes a long way, don't over due it as you don't want to waste and use more than necessary! One of the BEST cleansers I have found!  I am loving this stuff. My skin feels great after i use this and it has a pleasant non-feminine fragrance. I feel it has helped reduce hair bumps. I will definitely purchase this again. I've been using this cleanser for a couple months now, and I love it. It cleans and smooths the skin without drying. The scent is mild and not overpowering. I use it in the shower before shaving and again in the evening. Nice face wash, much better then the mass-popular brands that are out there but you do pay for that difference. I lean towards the more sensitive/oily face skin and this product has been working very well for me. Great product and you can feel it working.  Will be buying more. This is a great product, albeit a little expensive. I would recommend the manufacturer increase the amount of scrubbing beads in the product. Buy with confidence. My face normally gets dry when using face wash - especially in the shower. The first couple times my face got dry, but I acclimated to it and now it works and feels great. No dry face out of the shower. The only facewash I will ever use. Best stuff I have used, and I have tried a lot.  After a week I literally thought about buying a case of it to ensure it is always available to me! Great face wash. I use it once a day in the morning and my face is oil free and smooth all day I'm 54 have been using different brands of moisturizer for 25 years, I am knocked over. Love it, little beads, not to harsh, refreshing, addicting leaves your face tone, and so clean it feels great. I ordered this for my husband who's in his early 40s and it works great!!  We will definitely order more products from Rugged and Dapper One of the best cleanser for men in the market. I've used several cleaner brands from this is one of my favorite products. I bought this product and have been using it for about two weeks now. I try to use it 2x a day (am/pm). After use my skin doesn't feel dry, but full disclosure in the morning I do apply a facial moisturizer after use. The smell is great in the shower, not sure how long it lingers throughout the day, but its not overpowering in the slightest. This men's facial scrub is much better than anything you could buy over the counter. I tried nuetragena mens facial wash and it did nothing about my pours. My face feels clean with this cleaner. I will also say that this is my second purchase. The smell is not bad at all so if you are concerned with that then don't worry. This product is far more expensive than the facial washes that I have used in the past, still it is worth every penny. After years of trying different drugstore products, I have finally turned the tide against my remaining adult acne. The facewash itself is very good , you really feel refreshed and leaves the skin very smooth. The shipping for this product however took to long . Amazon prime is supposr to be a 2 day three day maximum ship days. I got mine in 5 days . Otherwise the product itself is pretty good. Makes skin smooth and cleans the face effectively. Been using it often, especially before shaving. Very happy with the product. Highly recommend it. This has been the best cleanser for my face.  My face just feels so much cleaner and it has really reduced all breakouts and has worked so well that I am branching out to their other products, too. I love using this product in the morning for a refreshing and awakening feel. Does not leave my skin too dry. Smells great and the smell does not linger for long. I will definitely purchase again. Leaves your skin feeling clean and soft without overdrying or feeling 'stretchy'. Given that ive mostly dry skin, no other face wash prior to this has had the same effect and I've tried a few. Pricey but if it doesn't require much of a portion per use so ultimately feels worth it. Recommended Excellent product and I have only used it a couple of times. It doesn't  have a strong scent to it, but boy it cleans your face leaving nice a refreshed. (more than any other mens product I have tried)  I will definately recommend and will buy again. Cleans thoroughly without drying out skin excessively. However, I would still recommend using it in conjunction with a moisturizer. Very satisfied, only I wish it wasn't so expensive. It does as advertised, what can I say?  My skin is clean, smooth, and the flaky skin is gone.  My skin feels tighter probably because my pores are clean.  I will buy again.  Worth it. I love this company and their product. Excellent Daily Facial Cleanser that smells wonderful and cleans and exfoliates very well. You only have to use a small amount to go a long way, so the bottle will last you. Definitely will continue to buy. Also I use along with the daily moisturizer as well Very happy with this product so far. Noticed a difference in how my skin felt the first day. I like this much better than other soaps and cleansers I have used. I have oily skin and the cleanser with it's little granuals make my face feel much cleaner. I plan to continue using it. I've not used a facial cleanser before, but I love the difference this has made. I've always suffered from oily skin and clogged pores, and pimples into my 20's. Since using this product, not only is my skin noticeably less oily, but it's also smoother and I am having fewer pimples to boot! Can't recommend this enough! Cleans my stubble face and the scent is awesome! Very happy with this product.. People around me started noticing the difference in my face within few days of use .. this is exactly what I was looking for .. What a difference!  A great product. The first facial cleanser to show improvement in a very short time! Honestly, the only face wash that has ever actually worked for me. I've gone through an insane amount of face washes trying to find one that would work and this is the only one that actually worked consistently without over drying and causing more problems than I had to begin with. Good stuff man. My girlfriend told me I need face wash. This had two of my favorite man words ( rugged & dapper). I mean you can't go wrong here, smells good, feels good, makes you look good. 10/10 Use this everyday since purchase. Notice a difference in my face after 2 days. Will continue to purchase and use. I have searched high and low for a good clean face wash specifically for men. This product leaves you feeling clean, and truly makes your face look fresh after a few days time. Very satisfied Second time I've ordered this. It's a bit pricey, but it cleans my skin and leaves it feeling moisturized instead of dried out. The smell is pleasant but not overpowering. A bottle lasts about 6-8 weeks with daily use. I'm kind of an old goat, so I may be beyond repair. But I've been using this for a while now and it feels good on the face. It forces you into giving an invigorating facial scrub while using it. So you come out of the shower feeling refreshed. And extra clean. I am 25 and have already dreaded shaving for 7 or 8 years. Shaving still isn't great but this lotion in combination with the face wash has pretty much eliminated my sore, torn up neck after shaving. Also, I love marketing, I think it is perfect and I have been encouraging my friends to try it out. Customer service is very attentive and the product is amazing.  I just got into this stuff now that I am mid 30s and I am happy to have found a company that has all natural products and is designed for men so I don't feel weird about using them. Lol Works really well. I've been using it for a few weeks now it and it leaves my skin feeling clean after a long day. I felt like it dried my skin out a little bit, but it wasn't anything that a moisturizer couldn't solve. I highly recommend this product. Makes my face look great and smooth. Must have for men. Great easy face wash. I have really enjoyed this product. After searching for something with a great price point and good reviews - I think I've hit the mark with this one. Very pleased. After my long hours at work then the gym and also after Bjj, this face wash does the job! It helps remove all the dirt and grime from my face and smells great. I would definitely buy this product again thanks rugged and dapper Since I've been using this, my face has been greatly improved. No more dryness. This product is absolutely amazing!! I love the scent, and I love the feeling afterwards. It makes me feel so great! I highly recommend people to try this product! Use every morning ( take a day off occasionally here and there since I believe anything in excess probably isn't good) does help make face look and feel clean and clear It's a nice cleanser.  I shower (almost) every day, and this bottle lasted me about 5 months.  All you need is a little pea-sized drop.  Smells good, like a man. I love the Daily Power Scrub by Rugged and Dapper. I use it every day, especially before shaving. I believe the scrub  helps me to get a clean, smooth shave. And my ingrown hairs have reduced significatly. So! the Scrub gets 10 Stars from me. One Of The Best Parts Of Waking Up Is Knowing I'm Going To Wash My Face With This Its So Rejuvenating And Gives You that Crisp And Clean Feeling Every Man Needs Some of the other facial washes I've used didn't irritate my face but it as didnt leave me feeling clean. This is the only wash Ive used that isnt too harsh and leaves me feeling clean Love how it feels. Skin looks great. The smell is a bit to AXE for me. I wish it was a bit more woody. But I will continue as I like my skin. Effective"" my favorite facial wash ever.. I made the right decision"" no need to say more.. Solid facial cleanser. My face has noticeably cleared up better since Ive been using it. Just wish the price was a little bit lower. But hey, you get what you pay for. This stuff is amazing.  I've used Dove, Neutrogena, Proactive.. I've tried it all.  This stuff leaves your face clear and smooth, and feeling extremely clean.  Definitely will be re-ordering this when mine is gone Amazing product, leaves my face feeling so clean and refreshed! I love that organic ingredients are used, and you definitely get your money worth with a 7oz bottle. Every man should have this, also purchase the Rugged and Dapper moisturizer, very important after exfoliating your face. Love the smell, great facial scrub would buy again! give it 2 weeks to work.your skin gets a little worse before it gets better. it did for me.it realy works great glad I took the plung and got some. I have one statement, its banging!Please send catalog for future purchases!Thank you, Excellent product !  I amusing it as apart of my shaving routine.  It cleans very well and preps my face for shaving.  The smell is fresh not flowery but natural.  I love the fact it is a simple product great customer serve.  Thank you guys for the email' Great product. Face feels great after using this for about a week now. Only thing is that I wish it had a better smell but that doesn't matter too much since it doesn't linger. I love the 3-in-1 approach to cleaning my face.  No longer do I need multiple products to accomplish what this does in a single bottle.  After just a few days of usage, I can already tell that my skin feels cleaner and healthier.  Can't wait to try R&D's other products. Love this product. Been using it for a week and it has already cleared up my face. I was a Clearasil user for years, but I'm much happier with this product. Can't wait to try the other products from Rugged + Dapper. Great product.  Goes on with ease and really helps pre shave. Pricey but it works well for my sensitive skin. Strong enough for that deep clean that wakes me up in the morning but doesn't leave my sensitive skin irritated or dried out. This stuff is amazing! I only recentrly started implemendting a facial care routine, and this cleanser is the backbone! My face feels so clean and fresh when im done, without drying it out too much. And the scent it leaves is just amazing. Great product....a two in one cleanser. Highly recommend. Any more products in the pipeline...how about a toner and and eye cream? Great product Love the product. I have very sensitive skin. Gentle on my skin, yet grear cleaning power. I'd give it a 12, if I could Does a good job of keeping my face moisturized after a shower and seems to keep my skin a little more even and colored Rugged & Dapper have the best products out there this facial scrub is perfect after a long day  working outside in a construction environment. This scrub has a decent scent and The right amount of grit to clean your face after a long days work. Provided I only used to use cheap facewash , this has dramatically improved my skin. If you have problems with pimples or oily skin get this , you will love it When I rub my hands across my forehead it's smooth as a baby's butt. This is probably the best face lotion I've ever used. Absolutely love this face wash. One of the best facial products that I've used and will definitely order again. I've been using the product for about week and so far I am impressed. My skin looks much clearer and cleaner. I had the same experience with this product as almost every other user... it's fantastic. It smells great, feels great and most importantly, works great! I'll be buying a another bottle of this and the moisturizer very soon. Highly recommended. Used the product for a few days. Smells nice, without overpowering. Hasn't dried out my skin. Will be trying more products from this brand. This is great facewash and the price is good for the quality. This is my 2nd time ordering this product. So far I have been washing my face for a couple of weeks with this product. Initially I was usin another product in the morning but honestly this product is superior and I can honestly see and feel the improvement. husband loved this product. I even tried it. and it made my skin feel baby soft. it really open up the pores and cleaned all the dirt. I would definitely recommend this product. Perfect solution for me.  I needed something that could scrub and cleanse, but, I needed it to foam a bit so I got the feeling of a clean face.  This stuff is a miracle. This is great stuff, I really loved it. Leaves your face feeling very soft and doesn't make it oily. Great product so far and great smell,  doesn't dry out my skin too much like others a little goes a long way so it'll last a while even with twice daily washes. great product!!!! I have a very sensitive skin, and I have been using this face wash every single day, sometimes twice a day.So far this face wash has no allergic affect on my skin and I feel clean and fresh after using it. Great product! Awesome product.  Great combination of face cleanser and scrub.  Scrubs have a tendency to dry out my skin but this product leaves my skin feeling hydrated. Fresh clean scent as well.  Highly recommend. Just started using the cleanser and the moisturizer, and both work wonderful! Very pleased with rugged and dapper! Definitely hoping I will be a lifetime client of these products! YESSSS A little pricey but worth totally. Does not dry my skin like most other facial washes and is not overly minty like other cleansers. Would definitely recommend. Works great! Really helps remove the gunk and oil from your face after a long day. Even helps to prevent ingrown hairs if used before shaving... Great product. I have dry skin and this feels amazing when I wash my face in the morning and in the evening. I would recommend this product. Great and worth the price...which is expensive, so be sure to only use a little bit at a time...but a little bit is all you need. It makes my face feel great! Gave as a gift; recipient loves the product! Really good stuffCompletely gives you that clean feelingWell worth the 25$ Great gentle daily exfoliate and my first experience using a toner? Wow, wife loves it! Need I say more... great all-around cleanser! Works great. Reduces oily shine. Skin feels smooth smells great too Awesome scrub. Lathers nice and the beads do a good job scrubbing. All organic ingredient, feel so natural and comfortable after washing. My skin dryness has totally gone. Gonna buy it again. Great product. so far so good! the first time I used the cleanser my face turned red. the next times my face responded well, clearing up a bit and feeling smooth and clean. Feels great on skin and helps prevents breakouts Very impressed with this product. It smells nice but is not overbearing and my skin has never looked better, and no break-outs since I started using. I highly recommend! Gentle exfoliation, no obnoxious ""perfumy"" odor, leaves skin feeling clean and refreshed. Just like I said in my review title, a perfect KISS (Keep It Simple Studid) Cleanser; exactly what I was looking for! Received my order in a timely manner. It smells great and leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed. I rarely review products but this product is the best! I was using Aveda products, those days are done. Will be purchasing again and again! I've been using this twice a day for a week now and it's a really good product.  Leaves my face feeling amazingly clean without over drying. Very satisfied - subtle, effective, and great for in the shower pre-shave. This stuff is amazing.  I bought it for my son who is starting getting pimples and they were gone within a day.  Great stuff Best product I've used so far. It does what it says it does.Very recommended. I will buy it as long as it is available. I've used quite a few facial cleansers in my day and even the better ones seems to be either to rough or don't clean enough. Rugged & Dapper though, just right! As tthe review said,this really is a fantastic product,nice touch,nice smell, most important, doesn't dry out after washing. the scrub are mild,can be used as a daily face wash without pain. This face wash leaves my face feeling clean all day. I have watched my acne diminish and the moisturizer is not greasy. GREAT STUFF!! Very happy with purchase, it is not rough. I  want  to add a request. Can you have it dispense in a pump form. This can control amt use, thus not wasting!!! Think about it Great all around face wash. I have acne and it is starting to help with that. Will be purchasing again! Makes your face feel refreshed also will work through a thick beard I like the smell and makes my face feel soft and smooth after using! I have made a switch to this 3-in-1 cleanser from the Kiehl's products I was using earlier. Gotta say it's really good. This is my second round with this product. Just picked up the lotion to go with it. Excellent product. Smells good and it seems to have a tightening effect on my skin. A not so harsh facial cleanser that leaves my face feeling smooth. It even cleared up some of my razor bumps and acne. I use it daily along with the rugged and dapper moisturizer. I love the product. It really works as advertised. Leaves my skin really smooth and soft. Take care of your skin guys! Fantastic face wash. Just enough grit to exfoliate gently on a daily basis. Leaves your skin smooth with a more youthful appearance This is a great product that has helped a lot.  With my job I get a lot of dust and dirt on my face and this has completely solved my sporadic pimple problem.  Comes in a pump bottle. Best face-wash I have ever used. Excellent product. Never going back to kyoku again. Worth every penny for younger, cleaner, more radiant skin. Great product ! Have been using it for about a week . Acne under control and my face is the smoothest it's ever been . Product is strong and leaves a refreshed feeling after use. Works great and does a nice job to prepare face for a shave Great stuff. Has kept my face free of pimples for a few months now. I've received a few compliments on my skin as well. I like it, cheesy name but it smells good without being too overpowering. Nice clean product no junk or filler. Great product. I use it daily in the shower in the mornings and once again at night. It cleans and exfoliates! Only a tiny bit is enough for your face, one bottle should last a few months. Excellent product. Great name & packaging and terrific follow up on behalf of the company. Five stars from me. one of the best facial scrub i have used. Leaves my skin feeling refreshed each time i use it. just a little amount works wonders. Love this facewash! Has a little grit, smells great and makes your skin feel really smooth. I love the product, it's showing the results in first few days of usage Great face wash! Clears up my skin and I feel fresh after each wash. Moisturizes and cleans without doing damage to my beard. Works great , face has really cleared up since using . Bought it for my husband and he absolutely loves it! Really good cooling and clean feel, great scent and good size bottle! Really amazing stuff. Worth every penny Bought this for my boyfriend and he loves this stuff! Fairly new to using this, but so far it's been great! Very refreshing.  Definitely can feel the exfoliating when you wash.  Great product, fair pricing. I really like this product. No smell and feels great on my face. I just received this and I have to say this is a great product!!!I could feel the difference WHILE I was using it, it was so refreshing.Will recommend to my friends for sure. Great for washing face and pre-shave. Skin feels cleaner. After a week of use I really like this. Very cleansing, without over drying the skin. I will buy again. goes long way/manly fragrence/works as stated use regularly hasn't dried skin Great product. The pumice in it is aggressive but not harsh. I use it daily with the Age + Damage Defense Facial Moisturizer and I can really tell it makes a difference. Feels and smells great.  Works well to smooth off my face after a busy day.  Black, masculine packaging, also! Great product, my skin has never looked better. Love this stuff. Visibly shrinking my blackheads I got this for my boyfriend to try. He tried it for the first time last night and LOVED it. He suffered from acne when he was younger and had a few deep spots on his face and after using it last night he said his face felt SO smooth. Even where he shaved it was extremely smooth. He said it will be a nightly routine now. He is a mechanic so a lot of times he comes home and has black oils etc on his face and it removed all of that from his hands too when he was cleaning his face. The smell is also awesome. It doesn't smell like a nasty face wash it's manly and pleasant..I was offered this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased opinion. I bought 2 of these and it does what it says. I like it I dont usually do this about skin products but this is by far the best face wash i have used in a long time. My skin feels remnarkable after the wash. not dry, not oily just perfect. I have sensitive skin and have tried multiple brands to find the right one. I have found it. Been using it for 2 weeks and I love it, I'm really digging this facial scrub. Smells good, and doesn't have those little balls that end up killing fish. =) I've admittedly only been using my Rugged & Dapper Power Scrub for a few days but think that a review is still in order. I will update it after a time to ensure my comments are still true. I chose this stuff because of the rave reviews and the fact that R&D is an all-natural product. I'm not one of those guys who avoid things that aren't all-natural but for a while I've noticed that my face hasn't been responding well to a lot of the face cleansers I've used. I also liked the fact that this is a cleanser, exfoliator and toner all in one. I do use another exfoliator twice a week but the exfoliating in this product is fairly gentle so I doubt it will bother your skin with combining the use. I'm no expert on exfoliation though.My first impression was not what I expected. The scrub was very nice and refreshing and left my skin feeling very clean without drying it out so I was very pleased until I woke up in the middle of the night to notice that the pores on my face were massive! I mean like huge craters! Fortunately this seems to have been only an initial one-time effect because I've been using it for a few days now and my face looks smooth and clean and my pores are nowhere in sight. I feel great after using it and my wife says my face smell nice which is an added bonus.So far I find this to be a great cleanser. Light with a pleasant scent and definitely something I'd keep using. I'm hoping that they'll keep the price at a reasonable amount so that I can continue to purchase it.Update: After about a month of using this stuff I've come to the conclusion that I can't live without it. My face is smooth and clear. I no longer have any mild acne on my forehead and it has helped me cut down on facial oils significantly. Seriously love this stuff! It will become a regular part of my grooming routine. Great product didn't iterate my sensitive skin and I got a great shave This stuff works and is what I have been looking for Love it! This is the best  facial cleaner I have used. I will be buying more, I am a customer for life. Product came as described. Very pleased Something I will be using for my entire life.  Pricey but after seeing the amazing results, priceless! Very happy with product. I was a little unsure if price was worth it and I was not let down Makes me feel fresh before college starts, i now love going out. great product that i highly recommend Excellent product. Lathers up nicely, you can see and feel the little scrub elements. Washes off without residue. Rugged and Dapper has a nice clean smell, the exfoliating beads are not overwhelming, and it leaves your face feeling clean and not overly dry. Very refreshing. Great stuff. Smells awesome, and has helped with my skin. A great product all in all. Highly recommended!"
B015G95C7A," Excellent! Gift I really like what it do to my face Face feels so clean. Would love to have a scented version of this. I love this face wash! It makes your skin feel super soft! ❤❤❤❤ Yes，it  is the one that I need. I will continue buying it I have really sensative skin, and a lot of products break me out. After using this product my skin has never been so clear! amazing, great product for all types of skins This smells good and feels nice.  I take it in the shower with me.  My skin doesn't  feel dry afterward which is important because the air is getting dry. I won’t be without this cleanser again! It feels so fresh and has no overpowering fragrance. My face is LOVING it! And no wonder - the list of ingredients makes me happy & knowing it’s organic gives me peace of mind. Both my daughter and I have notice a tremendous difference in our skin. I love this product!! Love how smooth your face feels after using this. I use it twice a day. This product, along with the moisturizer, cleared up my adult acne in under a month. I am amazed. I will post an update in another month. I have been using the face wash and the moisturizer for 6 weeks.  I am over 50 and have been experiencing enlarged pores and combination skin with occasional breakouts.  I read all the information on the website about this product and even had an email exchange with the owner.  I had never been educated in the ph level of my skin and how using products with too a high a ph level could damage my skin. I spend well over $1000. a year in skin care to have no appreciable difference in my skin for years now. I have not been using cheap skin care, I have always been a believer in you pay for the best ingredients. With just 2 weeks of using both the face wash and moisturizer I could see my skin become new, like it was healing and completely different.  Different in that my pores are smaller, my skin is so smooth and has a firmness that it has not had since I was in my twenties.  I feel like my face detoxed in the first week, like the blackheads and clogged pores were unclogging themselves.  I have never experienced anything like it.  I realize now that by using facial products that had a different ph level than my skin meant that my skin just couldn't fully function therefore never heal, so I would get into a never ending cycle of handling the bad effects of using the wrong ph level products with more wrong ph level products and on and on and on I have gone. I now see and feel the difference. I felt like I needed more and more exfoliation type products and I bought into the idea that with my age, my skin was needing to have layers peeled off to reveal more youthful skin.  Now with using these products and only these 2 products day and night my skin is no longer fighting with me and it is truly more beautiful and youthful.  I also am wearing less makeup to cover the imperfections as the imperfections are less and less.  The owner has told me that they are developing of a mask which I look forward to using. I'm the search of looking for something more ""natural"" this has come to save the day. I really like the Era Organics line, I bought the moisturizer and Dead Sea mask to go with as a routine and my face has had a drastic improvement. A little goes a long way too. It may be a lil spendy (I usually spend about $8 at most on facial cleansers) but this stuff works. I love this face wash!!! It washed my makeup off so good and I only have to use very little. Awesome product. I will definitely be ordering the moisturizer and scrub. I've been using this at night to help remove my makeup and it has worked amazingly it makes my face feel soft and clean and doesn't leave it really it doesn't leave it to dry which is extremely important So far so good. This is making my skin much smoother and softer. I was worried about having breakouts since I still have some acne but that hasn't happened yet and my face feels and looks great now. First off- I never write reviews for products, but I feel this was deserving... my face is truly the most confusing- super sensitive, but also extremely dry and oily...I have only used this face soap once, but it is the only cleanser that I can truly say has left my face feeling clean and light, but not super dryed out...It comes off easily (you don't have to tear your face off just to remove the soap), and is sparkly out of the bottle! This is a great product and you should definitely try!!! I reciieved my replacement bottle of Era Organics cleanser for the face today and I couldn't wait to try it out considering the first time I purchased it, my experience was not good.  The company that produced the product reached out to me and offered to replace the defective product without any questions asked.  They were apologetic and expeditious about getting me another bottle of the product in efforts to satisfy me, the customer, which was a refreshing experience in this day and age!  I tried the product again and was extremely pleased with the quality of the cleanser, it leaned my face completely and the consistency was good.  With this product a little goes a long way so use sparingly.  I commend this company, Era Organics for standing behind this product and satisfying the customer. Been using this line of products for about 1 month now.I have seen the redness and size of my acne shrink and come down.It leaves a smooth feel to your skin after use.I recommend using their moisturizing cream as well. This product is amazing. I barely have to use any and I am able to wash my whole face. I have oily-acne prone-sensitive skin that is resistant to a lot of products I've tried. My face feels clean without feeling tight. I don't really notice an odor and I'm pretty sensitive when it comes to smell. You can't beat the price for how long it lasts. Seriously you only need a little dab. I also use the lotion and highly recommend using them as a pair. Again I barely have to use any of the lotion and it covers my entire face. It NEVER makes my face oily, only smooth, soft and well hydrated. Received this in the mail yesterday so I've used this product twice. I LOVE LOVE LOVE it so far. It really leaves my face feeling very soft, without feeling oily. I have VERY oily skin and I'm blotting my face a couple times a day. So far I love the way my face has reacted to this & I'll definitely continues to buy. Really gentle and soft on the face. I am having bad acne break out and I wanted something that is mellow and will not do anything else but clean my face. After dealing with skin sensitivity and breakouts for years, this is the one product (as well as the moisturizer!) that has made my skin fantastic! I realized I have an allergy to common preservatives used in many products, as well as any type of fragrance. My skin has never looked or felt better while using these products. I highly, highly recommend! Best face wash I’ve ever used. I have super sensitive skin and it has absolutely changed my whole face. I hardly wear makeup anymore! I really love this face wash. Im a 28 year old woman. I have had 3 kids. I have always had naturally clear skin until about 6 months ago. I am so glad I have stumbled upon this face wash. It has been one of the only things to help cleanse my face and help to clear it up.. with the other products I use. I use this once in the morning, and once at night, with a silicone face scrubber. It leaves my face very clean and refreshed, but not stripped of moisture.My only negative compliant (if you can call it that), is that it does not smell good. I believe it is technically unscented, but to me, it smells of stink bugs. I would love a scented version, Lemon EO, or Frankincense and Myrhh EO, Lavender EO, as a nighttime face wash would be amazing.This is not enough to deter me. I will be buying the larger size, when I am out of my current bottle.It is gentle enough, that I can use it on my young children, without concern, that it would damage their skin. I have one child who is incredible sensitive skin wise, and she has not had a reaction to this face cleanser. Very nice cleanser. You only need a very small amount. Doesn't leave your skin feeling tight or dry.  I would definitely recommend!! I love this face wash! I had been struggling with dry, acne prone skin (w/ bonus perioral dermatitis) for a while trying to find the right combination of products to keep my skin happy. This is the first of Era Organics' products that I tried and I'm so happy that I found it. My skin has been generally clearer and much more hydrated. I started using this face wash around the time I was diagnosed with perioral dermatitis and started taking antibiotics. I have since stopped the antibiotics and am happy to report that this face wash does not give me acne or dermatitis flare ups. It's great!It's been so great, in fact, that I have tried several of their other products and love them all too! I was having some eczema happening on my face this summer that has never appeared before. I used this wash and it has cleared up within 5 days. I am going to continue using it. The best face wash I've ever used.  I'm a 56 year old woman with Rosacea and could not wash my face much as would get bumps under my skin. This face wash is the only one I've used that is actually getting rid of the bumps under my skin. I noticed the bumps were getting smaller the first time I washed my face with this product.  I now look forward to washing my face and wash it twice a day with this product. I bought my 30 year old daughter a bottle of this as she's always had major acne issues.  She also noticed how good her skin felt after the first wash.  She's used it for three days now and I'm hoping after using it for a couple of weeks she'll have the same success I've had. “Delivered on time. Love this stuff. Have replaced my soap and moisturizer with these products. Will definitely purchase again."" This face wash is the best invention out there for people with sensitive skin. It cleans while it treats. l love this product! Was hoping it would help with my dry skin and eczema. Especially since it's horrible in winter time with dry weather. It turned out perfect and a saving grace, kept my face soft and not red at all! Going to probably order this in bulk lol, thank you so much. I love this face wash. I have sensitive skin and many allergies, this face wash is gentle, does not irritate my skin more, and does the job. Have used only a short time and I see improvement with new growth.  Offering free product for a 5 star review is a good marketing strategy but it does make reviews less reliable.  That being said I would still rate it at 5.I would rate it at 5 anyway. First time user of this product and so far, I really like this product. As long as my face doesn't get red or irritated with future use I'm 100% happy with my purchase. Like most, I read the reviews and became excited to try this product! It really works! I see progress already and I've only been using it for just over 2 weeks. The only thing I don't care for is the size of the bottle. I think it's pretty high for such a small amount. This product is great! Leaves my skin feeling super smooth. Is a very gentle cleanser and it does a great job. I have dry sensitive skin and this face wash,  combined with a moisturizer,  leaves my face so soft and hydrated.  My husband even noticed the improvement in my skin. Nice product in just the right size container.  I only use a very small amount...about pea size and it covers my face and neck very well.  Somewhat the consistency of baby shampoo, so it feels soothing and doesn't need to lather a lot.  Rinses off easily and my skin feels very good afterwards.  Will buy again but this will last me a long time.  My only comment would be that it come in travel size of 3.4 ounces or slightly less since a little goes a long way.  But, I can always put some in a smaller container for travel. Amazing cleanser. I love this stuff. I have purchased it again and will continue to use this product. I bought this because I was looking for something that used all natural ingredients. This has far exceeded my expectations. I had extremely dry, itchy skin and no matter what I tried it just wasn't going away. I used this for probably about 3 days before I could see a noticeable difference in the dry skin on my nose and forehead. I use this on my Clarisonic and when I am done my face feels extremely soft and clean. I am so happy to not have itchy, flaky skin anymore and I was very surprised how great this product was. My friend decided to buy it after I told her how much I loved it and she can't get over it either. Definitely a great purchase! I'm a big fan of EraOrganics face products! My skin is healthy and chemical free. This is my second order. Husband and I are very impressed! The face wash has become a part of my skin care routine. I have already repurchased it and will continue to do so. I have sensitive skin and took me a while to find a face wash, even natural ones, that did not irritate my skin. This one is gentle and does the job at cleansing my face and removing any traces of makeup my makeup remover left behind. I was really skeptical when I first applied this because it doesn’t lather but after that I was hooked. This left my face SUPER soft and clean but it’s not drying. I usually get hormonal acne along my jaw line but while using this face wash my period came and went without a pimple in sight. Definitely a staple. I used to purchase my skin cleanser from Hydron, but after they went under, I opted to give Era a try after viewing so many excellent ratings. I received my order in a timely fashion along with an complimentary e-mail from the company. Thus far, after a week's worth of use, this cleanser works as promised. No issues, no reactions and my complexion is excellent! I will use this product again. Good stuff. You name it, I've used it. After years of searching, so good to have found something gentle that really works. Makes my face so happy! Love how clean and fresh my face feels afterwards Very Good Face wash. Leaves face feeling very fresh and smooth. I have Contact Dermatitis around my eyes and it can get pretty bad.  The doctor recommended washing with Baby Shampoo which is very drying and was not the right solution for this issue.  I have tried many, many products, including prescription steroid cream all to no avail.  Last night I used this product for the first time and again this morning and the skin around my eyes seems much better, no longer red or flaky.  I then put some of Era Organics Face Moisturizer on the area and this definitely helped.  I will update as I continue to use this product but so far I am extremely pleased. overall happy with this product. I have sensitive skin on my face and I dont like using just anything. this was gently and left my skin feeling clean but not ""squeaky"" like some cleaners do. I bought the face lotion too that they make, it was also super gentle on my skin and absorbed naturally, didnt feel greasy or heavy at all. I have redness to certain area of my face, i feel like the cleanser and lotion together are helping reduce that in my skin. NOte, i dont have problem skin, its relatively on the dry side so i cant speak for its ability to clear up acne/pimples. No chemicals!  Feels great on your skin and very refreshing. Great product does not dry out skin leaving it smooth and balanced! “Second time buying this product! I use the face wash and moisturizer twice a day. My face has never looked better. I would recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin. Pretty much everything I have tried in the past has either broke my face out or made it super dry. After using this product, my face is hydrated and smooth. I love this product !"" This face wash is pretty amazing! I found it while searching Amazon for sulfate and paraben-free face products to combat my perioral dermatitis. While expensive, a little goes a long way and my skin felt clearer, smoother and softer after just one washing. In the two weeks I've been using the face wash, I've continued to see similar results and couldn't be happier. Still waiting for the perfect cure for the dermatitis and still battling some redness, but this face wash is gentle and soothing and my face is noticeably smoother. I couldn't be happier! Helps my psoriasis and the itching along with the cream. I can not even begin to explain how much this face wash has really worked for me. I am on the high end of my 40's and about five years ago I started battling hormonal adult onset acne. It's embarrassing and really sucks. It seemed like everything I used just didn't help,almost like it was breaking me out even more. I have literally used everything on the market from the really expensive to the really cheap stuff with some to little relief for just short periods of time.I have spent hours online looking for anything to just give me my clear skin back. It's really frustrating and I know there is no miracle face wash where you wake up the next day with a clear face either, so I gave all of those products a full month each with breaks inbetween to see any improvement,with none of them standing up to their claims.Then I read a research paper that explained that your skins natural ph is right around 5.5 and when you wash your face with some of these other products it can send your skin into overdrive scrambling to trying to fix it. I went looking for an face wash that would calm down my skin with a ph balance and without all the extra added stuff in it and when I came across this face wash I was seriously skeptical, seeing that it was everything I was looking for with great reviews,that just doesn't happen to me. This face wash has far exceeded my expectations. It feels great on my skin and I have had no new break outs since I started using it. My face feels softer,is visibly clearer and I couldn't be happier! I also bought the moisturizer to give it a try and I love it too! It has started to fade the dark spots on my face and diminish my fine lines and using both of these for well over a month now I finally found something that keeps working for me.I also accidentally left my bottle behind over thanksgiving and my sisters got ahold of it and now they love it as much as I do and have started ordering their own. Thanks for the great products! This product totally helped my daughter to clear up some acne she was experiencing. She has very dry skin and this product worked great! I love how mild and gentle it is on my super sensitive skin, but also powerful enough to remove waterproof black eyeliner! Reordered today! This is good stuff been using it for a month now and my skin is soft and refreshed looking . Ive even noticed fine lines have diminished some .  Will definitely continue this for sure . Love this product it's light and cleans really well I have had a struggle with blepharitis and eczema. My face was red and scaly and my eyelids swollen and sore. I ordered this cleanser as I couldn't find a cleanser that didn't burn. After washing my face and eyelids, this cleanser did not burn, and my skin felt moisturized and not taut and dry. I also use the Relief cream, and will never be without them again. I  am so glad I found this company, the products are excellent and the customer service is topnotch. I am very pleased and will be reordering. Great cleanser for problem skin!  Helps acne without overdrying like other products. I was having some issues with acne, and I immediately saw results after using this face wash. Great product that I will continue to buy. You can tell from the moment you start washing your face, this is like NO OTHER face wash. The consistency is different. It doesn't lather that much, but cleans a lot better! Very moisturizing! I've used other face washes that are moisturizing, but do not clean well, and leave a skanky residue behind. This doesn't leave anything behind. Just soft, clean, well moisturized skin. I LOVE it! I have sensitive, acne prone skin, that doesn't like most products I try. Best face wash I've used! Cleans eye makeup off very well also! Best stuff ever!! It has worked wonders for my acne and rosacea! Leaves skin feeling smooth!! This face wash leaves my face feeling quite clean.  The smell isn't all that pleasant, but I didn't expect it to be fragrant.  I use this with the 10-in-1 moisturizer day and night and it seems to be a great combo. Love how my skin feels after using this cleanser. Need very little so it makes it more economical.  Love I've gone through hundreds of face wash products to find one that actually works. This not only made my skin clearer than it has ever been, but it feel softer and healthier as well. This truly works wonders, and you can feel and see a difference in less than a week. I have the moisturizer as well and i can't leave the house without applying it or I can tell the difference (especially in the harsh winter winds). Highly reccomend both the wash and the moisturizer. It has a higher cost than others but nothing compares to the quality. It’s amazing! My skin is dry and I have used many products, but they made my skin oily or dry.  This product does not form a big foam, but it cleans well. Plus, it makes my skin balanced and soft. I love it. Love all their products, but this one in particular is awesome I really like this, I was kinda nervous using this. Because some of the reviews said it made them break out or have really oily skin. Because I have oily/dry & acnepron skin. I tried this cause my other face wash had some up and down when I use it to get rid of my acne. When I used it the first time my skin felt amazing and after the first week my acne was going away. I'm soooo happy I found this face cleanser and keep buying this for now on. :) My daughter has very sensitive skin and can use this product without any problems. I can't say enough about this cleanser/restorer. I usually don't write reviews, but in this case I'm so grateful to find a facial cleanser that is all it claims to be (we're talking decades of searching here). A tiny drop is plenty as it spreads easily and quickly. It leaves my skin feeling clean but still soft and moisturized. Price is fair! Appreciate this small company's customer attention. Love love love! I have used rodan and feilds, dermalogica and plenty of other pricey face washes and this one tops them all! I have sensitive skin and frequent breakouts on my chin, this product has pretty much eliminated the breakouts! 5 stars all the way!!! Defintely a mild cleanser, which is exactly what I'm looking for.  I have very overreactive skin and it is getting more and more difficult to find something that works on my perioral dermatitis, without needing to go to the dermatologist for chemicals to put on my skin.  This is much cheaper and safer in the long run.  I'm so thankful to have come across this company! Love the texture of this cleanser ! So gentle on eczema-prone skin. I love it. Era Organics face wash is a staple in our home. In fact, the entire brand line is. We've been using the products since they first came out on Amazon. Wonderful product line and awesome customer service! I love how little amount you need to wash your face with this. I use it morning and night, the price is superb and the little amount you need will last me months on just one. If you're looking for something more thick and less runny then you won't like this product, but I enjoy it a lot!! Excellent facial cleanser!  I've been using different products for quite a while and was experiencing dryness and other irritations.  I started using this cleanser and noticed a big difference almost immediately.  My face feels soft  and clean.  The dryness and irritations have also gone away.Highly recommend this product with sensitive skin!! I love this cleanser.  Very luxurious and hydrating.  Will buy again. Have been using the fash wash for a little over 2wks and am loving the results. Highly recommended!!The natural face moisturizer cream has been great and I have been using this daily. I am loving all the natural products from Era Organics and  definitely recommend it! So far I love the product. My skin feels very soft afterward. I’ve only been using it for 4 days now. I will leave a follow-up review after some time has passed and I’ve noticed either positive or negative  results. A perfect complement to the already incredible Natural Face Moisturizer. I love them both! I have extremely sensitive skin, and this face wash has been amazing. It doesn’t dry out my skin, and it doesn’t cause irritation like most other face wash’s. I’m really happy with this product! This is a great natural face wash and won't leave your face feeling dried out.  I have Peri Oral Dermatitis and I am extremely limited in the products I can use, but this is not only cleansing but it's also moisturizing.  Plus it is a family owned company and the customer service is fantastic.  Great product, great company. I have been using this facewash for over a year now, and I can honestly say that it is the best I've ever used. I was a Neutrogena user for years because my dermatologists always recommended it for my combination acne prone skin. But when I got diagnosed with an autoimmune condition, I became much more aware of the toxins I was putting in my body. I wanted something that would truly cleanse my skin without irritating it or drying it out and that would not clog my pores either. I love that this is clean and safe and EFFECTIVE. I have not had any skin issues while using this (i.e. no breakouts, dry patches, overly oily skin, dermatitis, eczema, etc) My skin is clean, soft, smooth, and clear. I'm so thankful for this company and this product. If you're on the fence, try it.  I also use their Complete Moisturizer morning and night. It's amazing as well. Plus, this company has great customer service. I couldn't be happier. Omg the best facial and body cleanser I ever used! Made my skin feel brand new! Wish I had found this product sooner!!!! This face wash doesn't dry out my face.  I like it so much I just ordered two more bottles.  I've been using it about 2 weeks, and my face has cleared up significantly. Amazing product -- outstanding customer service  -  noticed skin texture difference second day !!!! I have been using this face wash for over a year and I love it. I keep one in the shower and one by the sink. It is a calming cleanser that thoroughly washes the face and leaves it feeling clean but not dry. Highly recommend! Love! It suds almost as much as a soap, leaves me clean, doesn't mess with my PH. I've been using this product for a few weeks now, and I can't say enough good things about it. It has cleared my skin, and helped me with a case of  mild blepharitis. I use it in my morning shower to gently clean my eyelids, and have seen a marked improvement in the condition of my eyelids. I am also very impressed with customer service, and that's an important part of any product I buy. While this cleanser does not get as soap sudsy as other cleansers do, it most definitely removes even the most stubborn eye makeup and leaves my face feeling clean but not overly clean or dry.  A little does go a long way so I don't mind paying more for a cleanser that is pure, simple and effective. I don’t usually leave product reviews, but I absolutely love this this face wash. I also bought the complete moisturizer and revive + scrub. All three products exceed my expectations. My skin is clean, soft and feels amazing. No dryness! I been using it for just a few days now and has helped my perioral dermatitis tremendously, I am amazed by this product totally in love with it at the moment! I have extremely sensitive skin and this face wash is not irritating. Cleanses well and smells delicious. Love this stuff. Gentle enough for my sensitive skin. I was a little skeptical when i first used it. They might want to think about changing the color... but it seems to work well. I have used it twice a day for six days so far I love it, no more dry spots on my face and it leaves my face very soft and moisturized I absolutely LOVE Era Organics products!!  My skin has come back to life!! I started using this while in my last month on accutane and it has helped tremendously with my dry skin. I'm looking forward to seeing how my skin reacts post accutane! Continue to use this exceptional product.  Moisturizing face wash especially important in the cold and also dry air of a heated home.  Thank you  ERA ORGANICS! After trying the excema/psoriasis cream I don't need weeks to test this facial cleanser; I have been buying the most expensive Aveda stuff, then tried the Andalou natural stuff and Aubrey Organics stuff for excema/psoriasis and it just got worse. With Aubrey Organics it didn't get any worse, but not improved enough so the search continued.I had very fair, very clear skin at 62, almost never needed makeup. When the red, scaly spots began to appear they were immediately very glaringly noticeable; cleansing and makeup made them worse. The really red, scaly spot high on my right cheek started small but got to be nearly the size of a quarter, the one on the left was like a reddened streak down my jawline.I've had wonderful luck with organic foods and health - my cholesterol went from off the charts, past the red line why-are-you-still-even-breathing 2 years ago to only midway up the absolutely stellar, healthy green column. I also lost that poochy stomach weight - so why not use organics topically as well?When the red spots appeared and then stayed, my dermatologist gave me scrips (why bother) and told me never to wash my face again - ohhhkkaay, but yuck. I am very active, sweat, oil & salt on my face is disturbing and cannot be just rinsed off so my complexion suffered even more. Not just the excema spots, I then had red blemish spots all over my face. I've struggled with this for three months now; I am of the opinion that if my skin had to start wrinkling a year ago it just seems unfair to have the dry, reddened, blemished skin thing going on top of that, accompanied by -ewe- scaly looking skin. The Era Organics cream had done so much already with minimizing the spots in just a couple of weeks and getting rid of the flakiness......So I get the brilliant idea to try the facial wash by ERA organics since the cream was so wonderful. After only a couple of days, I woke up this morning, my husband turned to give me a kiss and then frowned - so I panicked. Ran into the bathroom and the red is barely discernible, flaky is gone completely. The spot on the left cheek is history. I asked him why he frowned and he said he had been hearing so much about the red stuff that every morning when he wakes up he checks to see if it's worse. Not because he looks for flaws, just so he can know what kind of morning entertainment he can get out of my skin drama. Which, as a devoted, fairly new wife, I think is just mean..... So I feel perfectly justified in some new clothes. Ok, so I pay for them and he never reacts other than ""You look really gorgeous in that"", but that in itself is fishy.I have never gone wrong with organic ingredients. Every product possible in my house and life has gone to 'green' and it is amazing how much better everything is without chemicals. I even do my laundry and cleaning green and finally have whites again. I have no idea why it took me this long to realize that skin care would be far better as well, but duh. Era Organics is the best thing I have found and it is more affordable than the designer products. I just don't trust what's in them. Did you know the ingredients can be altered at any time with non-organics and many times companies don't even have to disclose this to us? Yet organics do. This cleanser is great. It has a mild formula but leaves the skin feeling soft, clean, and refreshed. The smell leaves something to be desired but it's not terrible and is worth it to have skin that feels this way. Awesome! The texture of my skin so smooth and clean without drying my skin. I will definitely purchase the cleanser again. I bought this a little over 2 weeks ago and wanted to wait to write a review.  I have to say this face wish is wonderful.  I wish I had taken before and after pics.  My face has cleared up, my skin also feels smoother. I bought this along with the exfoliating product and moisturizer.  I would recommend this product. I just want to go ahead and say this is by far the best face wash I have used. I Highly reccomend this product cleaned up my face so much!! dries out though, so be sure to moisturize This stuff is fantastic!!! I've purchased several natural cosmetics and this one takes the cake!  Balanced PH and quality simple ingredients that are high quality, what more could you want out of a face wash. Hats off to this family owned business I love this brand!  I've been using this cleanser for about a year now and it's really gentle on my skin. I have sensitive, oily, acne prone skin...a little bit of everything. It's been helping a lot for my skin and I'll be continuing to purchase this product. Cleans my face without the harsh dryness afterward This has been the only skin care line that has helped heal my skin from acne and terrible sun damage. I was so frustrated before finding this. It lasts a while, even though it doesn't foam. You don't have to use much to get results. Highly recommend for those with sensitive skin. I use this as a shower gel and have been incredibly pleased with it. It has no smell and has a nice lather. I use this with the cream and it has almost completely eliminated my dermatitis. Highly recommend. I just wish it came in bigger bottles! My favorite face wash. I've tried a lot and I think I'll be sticking to this one I bought this for my fiancé who has extremely bad excema all over. This has worked absolute miracles for his face and neck area! He loves it! I got this product about a week ago. I love how it doesn't have a scent and its slowly starting to clear up my acne scars. Great product so far,leaves my face soft and clean. I have acne prone skin and this product is very gentle to my skin. It doesn't clog my pores and it works great! Yes it was delivered to me so quickly. I received it one day rather than 2. I have to say that I've been dealing with acne since I was 13. I've been on so many skin clearing systems and have honestly tried every product. I'm almost 35 and now I have hormonal acne. Agh will it ever end! This year I have pretty much been all organic and I finally thought maybe I should try all organic on my skin. Well I have purchased a toner and an acne serum from a friend who is just starting out and that made a significant change over night. She doesn't however make a face wash. I've tried using just coconut oil, but it didn't really work for me. Then I found your product. I was so excited. I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE your face wash. I barely need much, so I know it will last. It removes make up and even mascara with out a residue in the morning. Even with some eye make up removers, I still woke up with a little black under my eyes.My face has never been so clear. And I've only had it for a week or so.  You have me as a forever customer for sure. Thank you for contacted me. You should be very proud of your product. It truly is amazing. Sorry for this long email. I am just thrilled to finally have nice skin. I am so happy that I found your product on Amazon and that out of all the organic face washes I chose yours. My dry and sensitive winter skin felt clean and rejuvenated after the first use- I highly recommend this product After years of trouble skin, I have finally found a product that keeps my skin clear and under control!  This product is worth every penny!  Fantastic! This is the only cleanser that has actually worked with my problematic skin, and it doesn't make me breakout it keeps my skin nice and clear. The only downside I would say is I wish the bottle was bigger for the price you pay. Other than that thi product is a must in my skincare routine! And the ingredients are natural! I use this to wash my face after a microdermabrasion treatment.  It's gentle and moisturises my face without it being greasy.  It's very natural and gentle, so it doesn't sting or hurt my skin after it's been dermabrased. This face wash is the best I have ever tried (and I've tried A LOT)! It does not dry out my face and after using it for about a week, I have noticed a difference in the brightness and condition of my skin. My chin acne has cleared up too! Highly recommend this face wash; its worth the price and a little goes a long way. lOve this product It's natural and awesome. love that It gently cleanses my skin without drying it, and the Ingredients are the best. I've had acne since my teens and my face cleared within a few weeks with this product! I love it I suffer from perioral dermatitis and adult acne  I have been using this product for about two weeks, and I have noticed a HUGE improvement in my skin.  For the first time in years, my skin is clear and the dermatitis is under control.  My skin feels soooooo much better.  The only other face wash that I found that helped my perioral dermatitis was Spectro for blemish-prone skin.  But the E-raOrganics smells much better and lathers much nicer.  My skin feels silky smooth in the shower.  I do still need to apply a moisturizer after I wash my face. I've been using Era Organics face/body wash as well as their Relief Cream for about 6 months now and I can't and will NOT use anything else. I have been suffering badly from eczema for the past 3 years. I get it on my eye lids, the sides of my face, jawline, chest and now a spot on my arm - totally stress and hormonal causing. I went to the dermatologist a year after it started and she prescribed a steroid cream that cost $180 with insurance - the cost wasn't an issue if it worked, but I also didn't feel comfortable using a steroid cream around my eyes or using it in general for a longer period of time. I started researching all natural, essential oil remedies and when they didn't work, I desperately searched online for a natural eczema relief routine. I no longer could use my face wash from Sephora or even Dove Sensitive body wash. Everything would dry out my skin and then the itching and pain and scaling would start. There was a time I literally only washed my face with warm water and a wash cloth because anything that I would wash my face with would aggravate the eczema even more. I came across Era Organics on Amazon and decided to try it out. It is now the ONLY thing I can wash my face and body with and the only moisturizer I can use on my face. I have combination skin - oily T zone dry every where else and the cream doesn't make me break out.  I even tried it on my lower legs that are so dry and itchy and it completely changed my skin. If I hadn't found these products, I don't know what i would've done. Thank you to Tyler and Era Organics for relieving my horrible eczema problem. I've told so many of my clients and friends! My face is squeaky clean, literally. High quality, well thought out cleanser. Thank you. I'm pretty sure I found a face wash for life <3 Love the face wash...so gentle....I have very sensitive skin and this face wash is non irritating....leaves my skin soft and non irritated...would definitely purchase again...and Era Organics reaches out to the consumer...I nice touch....I like the fact that this is a natural product....glad I made this purchase.... Love the way this makes my face feel so clean and smooth Finally a product worth every penny. I simply love this for its gentleness and facial clarity. Please continue making and selling this fantastic product. Washes nicely. Doesn't have a lot of lather but that fine. I still feel like it doesn't it's job. Skin feels moisturized and smooth after. Not greasy I will start off by saying I NEVER give reviews unless I feel a product is exceptional…seeing as I am taking the time to write a review I am saying this product is exceptional!!!  I HAD Perioral Dermatitis around my mouth area for months…it was awful, painful and ugly.  I spent a lot of money seeing 2 dermatologists who gave me prescriptions for very expensive medicine which did absolutely nothing but empty my wallet.  Over the next few months I tried and tried many OTC products that did not work either, then I came across a blog post that recommended Era Organics Face Wash.  I thought, what the heck, if it doesn't work I would just add it to the mound of other crappy products I bought that didn't work.  Well, I am so thankful I found this because it has been the ONLY thing that has helped my PD and I am so happy to say it is completely gone.  I will continue to purchase this product because it cleared up my face but I also LOVE the natural ingredients they use.  My 19 year old college son also is using it and we also use the Shampoo and love it also.  Thank you so much for this product.  It really is an AMAZING line. It's hard to explain why a facial cleanser could be so great but here goes: a very little bit makes a nice suds that makes my face feel a popping of getting oxygen. After finding my face is left smooth and soft, I love this cleanser! This face was works great. It doesn't have any chemicals which make it scented so it doesn't smell like anything, but it does make skin look smoother and clear. Always great product! Customer service is excellent! Super product. Makes skin clean without drying it out or causing any irritation. I'm going to try the moisturizer next. This is a much better facial wash than others I've tried for my sensitive skin. So far is good my skin is very sensitive and os taking this product good. Awesome product for my highly sensitive skin. Will buy again! I love this face wash! Cleans my skin really well without drying it out.  It doesnt get all of my eye makeup off, but that's ok - I just use a little coconut oil. :) This product is AWESOME! I have extremely sensitive skin, but I am able to use this with no problems. I use this with the Era Organics Complete face cream and  I am already noticing a difference in my skin after three days. I would highly recommend these products for someone with very sensitive skin. I don't have very good luck with face washes/creams, but based on the good reviews I thought I would give this and their face cream a try.  My skin is very sensitive and always red (I've never been officially diagnosed, but pretty certain I have rosacea), and no face wash/cream I've ever tried has made any difference.  After just a few days of using this face wash/face cream combo only once a day in the morning, I could already see a difference!  I've had such little luck in the past that I started wondering ""is it really the ERA Organics stuff, or am I just having a good week?""  Then I went on a vacation for almost a week and forgot to bring it, and my bright red face let me know that it was indeed this wash and cream doing the trick.  For the first time I have finally found something that makes a difference in the redness in my face and it's organic and all natural to boot!  Hallelujah! Cleans well and doesn't dry my skin out. After the very first and second use I already falling in love with it. I bought this one hopefully it's gonna help with the extremely dry skin on my chin. Will keep using it and see. Love this stuff! Skin feels awesome! I love this product. It's the first face wash I've used on my sensitive skin that doesn't make my face overly dry and stripped. So hard for me to find a good sensitive cleanser but this stuff works. I've been using this product for a little under a week. This is the first face wash I've tried that hasn't dried out my skin. My skin has never looked so good - though, I am pairing it with a few other things so I'm not sure that I can fairly give this wash full credit. I was looking for a new facial cleanser and I tried this product strictly off the reviews. I've been using this for about 3 weeks now, along with the moisturizer. I see a definite improvement already! Im a 45yrs. old. So far so good. I plan on using it through the summer and fall hopefully it will do its job in the winter. been getting compliments on my face. I am not one to use makeup so to get compliments its a thumbs up! I could honestly cry. My skin feels completely different. I use this in conjunction with Era's ""complete"" moisturizer and it's amazing.Normally, I have obnoxious combination skin. I get all kinds of acne; my skin is very oily, but somehow also dry enough that by the end of the day I end up with a layer of soggy dead skin on my face. I'm so pale that red marks stick around forever. I've. Tried. EVERYTHING. I'd resigned myself to never growing out of it.This has changed my skin entirely. At the end of the day, and when I wake up in the morning, my skin hardly feels oily at all. When I wash my face, I don't feel like I'm sloughing muck off my face--it already feels clean and smooth. It's not dry; it's not oily; any acne spot I get heals within a day or two. It requires a bit of patience. My skin was a bit weird while it adjusted--maybe it was bringing stuff to the surface, or maybe the change in PH was the issue. At any rate, I got more whiteheads at first than I would normally. But they healed surprisingly quickly, so I stuck with it. In the long run, it's very much worth it. I've had no problems since then, not even the hormonal acne that always, always comes (came?!) with PMS.My skin isn't magically perfect--but it is the skin of a normal 28-year-old lady, and that's pretty magical to me. Seriously, if you're at you're wit's end, it's worth a try. Product doesn't over dry my skin. Liquid is thin. No strong smell. So far so good. Another great product!! I use the soap with the complete cream and it makes my face so soft and cleared me up. I have very sensitive skin and this does not bother me at all!! Tyler the seller is great and I would highly recommend his products!! Great daily cleanser, but would still need to use an exfoliate cleanser occasionally too. If you use it on your Clarisonic it works great! Love these products.  Non drying and not greasy. Smells wonderful. Will purchase again. Talk about a totally organic experience, this face wash is amazing!! I only use organic products & this is the number 1!! I love how moisturizing it is & how my skin felt after using it. I will be buying again !! It also arrived when it said it was. I love this product!!! It works great for my sensitive skin that is prone to getting red. I also had a good experience with the costumer service for Era Organics. Nice and efficient!!!! Will be buying again when I run out. Smells natural, kind of like honey. Applies to face nicely. I will continue buying this product. I've had it less than a week, but I can already tell a difference. Also very impressed with their customer service- small, family owned company determined to impress! I highly recommend trying their products. The face wash feels so good on my skin and has made my rosacea, sensitive skin look so much better.  Awesome company!  Awesome customer service.  The owner cares very much! This is the best face wash I have ever used. I'm not normally a person who has to have organic, but my face has never felt so clean before! Also fresh! It's worth it for the money! Finally a product that truly does what it says and claim...perfection in a bottle..im a black man with oily prone break out skin...this cleanser is a GOD send...i hope it never goes out of business or change the ingredients...its perfection! ! I love it!! it is very gentle on my sensitive acne prone face. This is a new must have for my daily routine, it is gentle and does not dry out my skin but still gets it sqeaky clean. I have super sensitive skin and it doesn't break me out at all. (I have normal to dry skin) My face was so dry and this face and body wash seems to help. Will be ordering again. I was presently surprised that this face wash was too watery! I was hoping it would be more of a moisturizing creamy cleanser. Other than that, I like this overall:) I would recommend the moisturizers over the cleanser! Love this face wash! Love this product and I have used it for about 2 years and will keep on using it. I love this company, the products work really well, the customer service is outstanding and my skin has never looked so good! Excellent product- left skin feeling both clean and soft and mosturised, which is no mean feat for a skin cleaning product! Great product! Does not strip away natural skin barrier and respects skin's ph It's not hash on the face like other facial wash that leaves my skin dry. Good I love how natural this soap is and you get a lot of it. The price is a little steep but I like how gentle it is on my sensitive skin. I suffer from hormonal acne so while this doesn't help prevent it for me, it does help soothe it and cleanse my skin with no harsh chemicals. Repeat Customer! Best face wash. Great stuff! I wish it came in a much larger size as I use it on my entire body. I will never need another cleanser I have reactive, sensitive skin and this face wash has worked well for me that I also bought a smaller size for when I travel. I have been using this face wash for about a week and I love it so far. I love that it is 100% natural and it has really diminished my blackheads when nothing else has. I also love that it's PH balanced- very important. This face wash and the accompanying moisturizer are amazing!! I am always so skeptical of product reviews of beauty products on amazon. I actually check most products on the fake review check website fakespot.com it runs through all the reviews of products and tells you how many of them are fake/paid reviews (it's so handy!) This product and the other Era Organics products got great ratings so I thought I would give it a go - wow am I glad I did!My skin had been having the worst breakouts related to hormonal birth control. This product and the moisturizer cleared up my skin in no joke 1 week. Not only does it prevent smaller white heads all my cystic acne comes to a head immediately so it can easily be extracted. I wish I had taken before and after photos because it really is something you need to see to believe. Even my boyfriend was shocked how nice and glow-y my skin was with absolutely no makeup on. This brand is definetly my new HG brand. love your facial wash and that is ph balanced.  I had very bad adult acme but after using your products my face is perfectly clear.  Thank you A big thing that grabbed my attention about these products was actually in the reviews. The owners of this Era Organics work diligently to try and comment on everyone's review (whether good or bad), which means they believe in the product they sell. Huge thumbs up, because that's what made me try these out. And I am not disappointed!This is unlike any face wash I've used before. I have been using this for a couple weeks with the Complete Moisturizer and I am hooked! This cleanser doesn't get sudsy, but my face feels fresh and dewy after rinsing. This with the moisturizer has made my sensitive dry skin come to life again. Although it is not ideal for getting off heavy eye makeup, I have had no difficulty getting off my concealer and foundation.I hope to be using these products for a long time! I can't seem to get enough of this product.  I just love it! I purchased this and the moisturizer after battling an under eye dermatitis reaction to another ""organic botanical"" product purchased here on Amazon. I had been battling this rash on my delicate under eye skin for 3 months! It looked awful and the only thing that helped was steroid cream from a doctor, but every time I stopped using it the rash would come back worse. I was having a viscous steroid rebound cycle! I had stopped using the steroid cream for about 4 days and the rash was returning as usual right when these products came in the mail. Instead of starting the steroid cream again I used only these two products and it stalled the rash progression for the first two days, and over the next 3-4 days I could tell it was better! It's been a week and I expect it to be fully gone in one more week. I'll update in another 1-2 weeks on if it is still helping. I also have sporadic jawline acne that I'm hoping it helps as well. My skin is very sensitive and very dry as I used Ziana gel.  My doctor recommended to find some gentle face wash instead of the regular ones as those cause burning.  This one is perfect.  No more burning. Love this product ! Fast shipping ! My skin has never looked or felt better . Thank you Era Organics. I will definitely recommend you to all of my friends. This stuff is amazing. Wish the face wash came in a bigger bottle! The moisturizer feels like you have nothing on. It's so light! Doesn't feel greasy like my old one. My skin is very sensitive and razor bump prone. After shaving i applied day bump stop. I just this face wash not only it completely cleans my face. It stops hair bumps. I recommend it to all skin types. This product exceeded my expectations.  It's light and refreshing. Leaves my skin so smooth that a few times I've forgotten to use moisturizer.Will definitely buy again. I can't say enough good things about Era Organics products. I just started using the face wash and complete moisturizer a few months ago, and I absolutely love it. I have had horrible cystic acne for most of my life, and the wash and moisturizer are the only things that have kept my skin from continuing to look awful. My skin is never dry and flaky; my skin tone is even for the first time ever; and I rarely breakout anymore. Even the hyperpigmentation and old acne scars have faded and are starting to fill in. I also highly recommend the dead sea mud mask. My skin feels soft and smooth after 15 minutes in the mud. :)My only issue now is that if I use anything but these products, I have breakouts like crazy. Never stop making these products!! This face wash makes my skin feel so clean, yet not dry.  I have dry patches of skin that have completely cleared up after one week of use of this product followed by same company moisturizer. Feel good and works very well. With the cold weather my face was very dry. No burning or dryness with this stuff. My face has cleared up and just looks better! I use once a day when taking a shower. I love it, will buy again! Fantastic.  It was a bit more than I usually pay, but it's wonderful.  You only need a little and I'll definitely be buying again.  I have very sensitive skin and this works well for me. Fantastic product line..Helps with all kinds of skin issues.. Best face wash I have ever used!  Exactly what I've always been looking for :) Great product and it doesn't irritate your eyes. Very gentle cleanser.  I have rosacea and very sensitive skin and this works great for me. I love it. will buy again. great customer service. I am overjoyed to have (finally!) found this amazing product.  When I read the review by the lady her 50's who had been buying expensive facial products for years and was unaware of the ph balance required for healthy skin I knew I had to give this a try. I am nearly 60 and have been plagued by adult acne since my 30's.  I have tried countless products, seen many aestheticians, dermatologists, etc. etc. and no one ever spoke of the proper ph balance to use. I just learned about this from a young hairdresser who commented about my split ends and asked if I was using a ""natural"" shampoo. And indeed I was and she took the time to tell me about the importance of using products with a 4.5 to 5.5 pH for hair and face (which she learned in her chemistry classes to get her license...) Well, the first thing I did was buy a pH kit (SEOH O14) and tested every single product I'd been using. Hair stuff was 7 to 9 pH, no wonder it was so dry, but the worst was the ""natural, organic"" soap I was using on my face that came in at a whopping 9.0 pH. Omigosh! And bleach is 12pH! No wonder my face was such a mess.  So, I read the reviews on this product and this was 5.5 pH (oh and beware of products which say they are pH 'balanced' - that simply means the pH is 7.0).  I've used this product for just a few days but already notice a remarkable improvement.  No more breakouts, no redness and best of all, my skin glows and that is really something. Lastly, thank you to Tyler Chase, owner of Era Organics, who is a terrific source of support and information. I absolutely love this face wash. It keeps my face fresh and clean. I believe I found my lifetime face wash that I will continue to use forever. :) This cleans my makeup off and leaves my face feeling soft. I've had no new acne pop up since I started using! I've been a soap person my whole life so this is the first time I've used a face wash consistently. It's very creamy, and a little goes a long way. Works great! Bought this to use on the HCG diet, and it is the only wash that did not terribly dry out my skin or interfere with the HCG protocol.  Highly recommend; gentle and effective. Cleans well. My second order of this face wash. I love it so much! I just wish that, for the price, that the bottle was much bigger. It seems like a lot for so little of the product. Been through a lot of cleaners and this is the only one that keeps my face clear :) It's a bit expensive for how much you get though. Very effective products,  This is my second order of the face wash.  If you have problem or maturing skin (I have both), I would recommend this face wash. I have adult acne....luckily I found this product....my face is clear and I swear my wrinkles are less noticeable! Highly recommend My wife loves it. It's a high quality product,  working very well on the combination skin with high sensitivity to everything that is not natural. Amazing product I love this cleanser. I use it as a face wash and it does a great job at cleaning my face, yet it doesn't strip it of moisture. Brilliant! Gentle cleaning and may eliminate the need of other facial lotions that I've been using.. Have a couple of Era Ogranic products and they are great!Tried all other brands one can think of (or see advertised) and none can compare. This product is very gentle and leaves your skin soft. I am a fairly new user of Era Organics products and can testify to their quality. I began with the facial scrub and was so impressed I purchased the facial wash. There is no annoying fragrance or scary coloration to these products; they're pure and truly organic in the intended meaning of the word - not just for marketing purposes. I can't imagine anyone not loving the entire line. I certainly do! I am 60+ years old with a very schizophrenic skin type and the neutrality and gentleness of the products is just what any complexion needs! Love this! I really loved it, i use it daily and helped with my eczema Wow finally found a cleanser that's gentle and works will always order from here shipping was so fast Excellent facewash! Very gentle on the skin and their customer service is fantastic. Highly recommend! Face cream feels really good when you use it. I am 53 years old and have struggled most of my life with skin issues.  I have wasted so much money on products and empty promises trying to find relief.  I have been using your products for only a week and I can already feel and see a positive difference in my skin.  I can not express to you how appreciative and relieved I am.  I have not had any adverse reactions. Which is a rarity for me as everything seems to irritate my face.  For the first time in a very long time I have hope. Thank you for your superior products and your dedication to quality and customer service. I will certainly be recommending Era Organics to everyone I know. I bought this cleanser in conjunction with the Relief Cream for my mom who suffers from rosacea.  She was using Oil of Olay Cleanser for Sensitive Skin and a prescription cream from her doctor with little to no results...redness, itching, scaly patches and blisters.  I first bought her the Relief Cream and she saw such an improvement that I bought her the cleanser.  She loves it!  The blisters on her nose are gone and there are only a couple of dry patches left.  I'm now going to purchase the cleanser and Complete Cream for my 26-yr-old daughter so she can have beautiful skin for the rest of her life.  Highly recommend Era Organics products!  And in an age of crappy customer service, theirs is stellar.  The owner of the company personally emailed me to find out if I was happy with the product; I was blown away.  Give their products a try. Love this stuff, seriously. Nice gently soap.  Keeps my face soft and supple! :)  Happy with this product! Really gentle face wash without harsh chemicals. Love it! Best cleanser around!!! purchased and used by a man. love it, would buy it again Very gentle facial wash.  :) this really works, And does not cause any breakout or pimple unlike other products I had been washing my face with raw honey, and it made my cheeks smooth, but its pretty messy, and so I wanted to try a face wash that had manuka honey in it. After one use my cheeks feel smoother. This face wash isn't overly drying, but I wouldn't call it moisturizing. I have a problem where my nose and cheeks always look flushed, so I'm hoping this cleanser will help, its too early to say, but the edges of my cheeks do look less red. Cleanses well. Doesn't leave my face dry. Feels good Love the way my face feels after using it. Highly recommended! Love it... leaves face feeling clean and fresh... This stuff is amazing. I have had dry skin my entire life and finding a good face wash was nearly impossible. Finally I got sick of the crap that I was using and decided to try to find something better. This product is so great! I have never felt my face so soft or hydrated ever! Love it! I've bought it twice and also purchased the face cream. Would highly recommend this line! Just bought so I am trying if. I love itttt Very good natural product! I love it. I love this.. Wonderful product This stuff is AMAZING! I have very sensitive skin, prone to breakouts badly, rashes if using wrong products with too many chemicals, wrong makeup, and hormonal issues. Was experiencing a very bad rash breakout and bought this along with the moisturizer after seeing a recommendation for it and OH MY GOSH so glad i tried it! Was super skeptical, especially since it is on the pricey side and i have tried so many things only to have them not work. I saw a difference after only a DAY! After 4 days my rash was GONE and my acne was less red and some even disappearing! Was so happy! I still have some acne issues but nothing compared to what i usually do and this makes my skin so soft and glow and just look overall so much better! And i have only been using it for TWO WEEKS, the change is so drastic that i wish i had taken before and after pictures! Highly recommend! Please see my reviews on their other product pages as well :)  This is the BEST natural face wash I have ever used!!  It cleans, and moisturizes in one treatment. I have rosacea and the medication gel I use dries the skin. I have to be careful not to use products with fragrance and oil which aggravate my particular type of rosacea. This works perfectly. Cleans with no tight feeling, not greasy, neutralizes the skins PH; also feeds and nourishes my skin. Top of the line ingredients. I never have to use additional moisture with my skin. THIS PRODUCT IS ALL I NEED. Of course, each individual will adjust to their own needs. I have spent hours researching products and so glad I tried E-ra Organics. Another additional perk is the wonderful customer service. This is rare in today's business world. You will not be sorry by any purchase of their products :)  1/27/16 I have been using this face wash for 3 months and will not use anything else. Let me share with you that I have rosacea, the kind that has breakouts. The dermatologist has me on a twice a day topical medicated gel. For face washs I tried Cereve; Cetephil and Nutregen--all of them added to the problem with further breakouts. Since using this face wash I have now beautiful clear skin, it feels moisturized and soft and no breakouts!!! I have not had to use the medicated topical gel but occasionally and for just once a day :) I am so happy to share that I use nothing else on my face---I will be sharing this with my dermatologist so that he can share with other patients that might be helped also. Remember to be patient; each one is different and each problem is different. You know your own condition best. This does not dry the skin, but softens and moisturizers gently.  Forgot to mention, soon I am sure I will not need any topical Rx and just be using this healing, soothing, gentle, non-drying face wash. JUST LOVE IT!!!! I have been using this product less than a week and I am incredibly satisfied with it.I have VERY sensitive, oily, acne wrought skin. My face is so sensitive just touching it causes irritation. I switched to a satin pillowcase because a normal pillowcase was so rough. My skin used to BLEED during the course of sleeping, washing it, applying any kind of cleanser or moisturizer... it was not pleasant.I switched to this and my face no longer bleeds. It isn't sensitive to the touch anymore. I can apply this vigorously onto my skin and it feels great and doesn't cause pain or bleeding.The best part? I'm prone to purging when I switch skin care products. I have purged, but it's not nearly as bad as it is usually. I'm not horrified to go outside. And the existing acne is improving already - only after 4 days of twice daily application. Love it ! This face wash has honest to God saved my skin! I have sensitive skin and had cystic acne that would come and go, along with major scarring but  just like the bottle says it completely restored my skin. Now it's clear, glowing, and ridiculously smooth!! Since then, I've bought all of their face products and they are worth EVERY PENNY! No lie, Era Organics is hands down the best skincare brand I've ever come across and I'm so thankful I did! Excellent face wash.  I have highly sensitive skin and this is gentle but actually does a great job removing make-up.  Does not leave any residue and your face feels very clean.  I have used their moisturizer for some time and will be buying more of their products.  Very well priced and excellent quality.  Thrilled to have found this skin line! I suffer from dermattis on my face and I finally found something that work. It leaves my face feeling refreshiing and more importantly, it doesn't leave me with outbreaks of bumpy, red, itchy results. I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to everything, but I absolutely LOVE this face wash.  It doesn't take much either so it lasts awhile even using it daily.....I will definitely continue to purchase Era Organics Amazing customer service, great product -- thank you! I have been using this for about a week, and am already 100% planning to continue to order. It's gentle, removes makeup, and isn't full of strange chemicals! I bought this for my wife who has really bad eczema. She used it the first day on just her face to see if we noticed a difference. The next morning her face was noticeably less inflamed, and her skin was smooth and even toned. This stuff works, although pricey for the size. But with that being said, it's definitely worth the price. It works! Love the face wash; works well for all skin types. This is the best face wash I have ever used! I have terribly sensitive skin, and am allergic to many ingredients. Most everything irritates it. But this product doesn't irritate, doesn't make my face turn red, and leaves my skin soft. Will definitely buy again. This face wash is perfect for my eczema face. Even the local specialist can't fixed my eczema problem but this is like miracle for me. I strongly recommend anyone who have eczema problem to use them"
B00809ERAM," I recently began a quest for all the beauty products needed to achieve the youthful, dewy look ever popular in Korea in anticipation of my wedding day. (Yes, I'm an American who watches a lot of Kdramas and became supremely jealous of Kon Joon-He's character in ""She Was Pretty."") I've had a fantastic experience with the new skin care regimen: huge reduction in blemishes, almost completely eliminated the pimples!!!--I just get one or two during my period--evened skin tone, and overall a cleaner, softer face. Since it's been so overwhelming to research every step on my own, I'm providing a list of all the winners so far, and in what order of the skin care/makeup routine to use them in. Hopefully this is helpful for anyone who wants to venture into the world of Korean skin care but isn't sure where to start. **Indicates the product in review.1. Cleanser - The Face Shop: Rice Water Bright**Apply this to dry, unwashed skin and gently rub in circles to fully cleanse your face. Works as a makeup remover, but I'd recommend a different product for eye makeup removal. Rinse the oil off with lukewarm water. This is the perfect, gentle cleanser for sensitive, mixed oily/dry skin, like mine. It has a very faint smell of rice water. Not surprising, considering that's what it is. A little goes a long way, so one pump is usually enough for my entire face. Be careful not to carry it sideways in a makeup kit if the pump gets loose. I made the mistake of doing that, and got all my other products coated in rice water cleanser. ;) Oh, and that little plastic thing on the pump pops right off. It took me forever to figure it out. I kept twisting and unscrewing and finally realised you just pull the little plastic piece right off and then snap it back on when you're done for the night. :P2. Toner/Refresher - Etude House 10-in-1 House Wonder Pore FreshenerTightens pores, and purifies skin. Apply to a cotton pad or cotton balls and then to face. Let dry.3. Moisturiser - Skin Food Peach Sake EmulsionPretty self-explanatory. Apply right after the toner sets in to feed your face with some moisture.4. Serum - Skin Food Peach Sake Pore SerumA slightly more concentrated moisturiser to apply after the first. Yes, Koreans have many steps (most of them moisturising ones) in their beauty routine, I've learned. But it really does amazing things to your skin. And once you get the hang of it, applying all these products every night doesn't really take a whole lot of extra time. It also cuts back on my makeup routine in the morning, because when my skin is naturally healthy, clear, and soft, I'd rather show it off than cover it up. ;)5. Night Cream - Nature Republic Fresh Green TeaNOTE: This particular product is not sold on Amazon. I had to buy it on sale at my local Korean market because I was too scared to order anything over $10 that I wasn't sure about. But you can find any number of night creams here for the final step. I recommend something with green tea or aloe. Just apply at night onto clean, pampered skin, rub it in thoroughly, and sleep on it!Other Cosmetics/Extras I Found Useful/Worth Purchasing:Facial Scrub - Skin Food Black Sugar MaskUse twice a week for a deeper facial cleanse than you regular cleanser. Apply a little, gently exfoliate, leave on, rinse off. If it goes on too thick, use a little water or toner to make it easier to scrub in.CC Cream - Lioele Dollish CC Cera-VCC Creams are much like BB Creams, (not a cream to match your skin colour, but a transparent foundation/primer) but if my experience with the two I've tried is any indication, CC Creams give more coverage and make the skin look more bright, white, and luminescent, rather than simply evening out the skin tone and providing SPF. Apply before any colour foundations.Highlighter - Etude House Secret Beam Highlighter #1 Pink & White MixTo be brushed on over foundation in key spots to brighten the face even further. Goes on like a sheer fairy dust--just a bit of sparkle, but not like glitter. This isn't for a Labyrinth Masquerade ball, you know. ;)Face Mist - Innisfree Green Tea Mineral MistFace Mist is something you apply whenever you choose, before or after makeup, to keep your face hydrated and fresh throughout the day. I carry a bottle in my purse and spritz a little on whenever I feel my face is tired. :) This particular mist I haven't tried yet, because my order hasn't arrived, but I bought a Nature Republic bamboo mist from my local Korean market, and I love it a lot.Products I Didn't Think Worth the Fuss:Face Masks- These are a huge hit in Korea, and they're fun to wear around the house to get a rise out of family members who think you look creepy. But for me they're too sticky, drippy, and overrated. I prefer the clay masks or avocado masks that you have to wash off after.Expensive Serums, Essence, Bee Toxin... anything over $20 a bottle I passed up. As I've discovered, you can get really great results with just the five things I listed above, and none of them are over $15. Most are under $10. Very impressed with this oil. The first time I used it was right after I got out of the shower, my face was clean...or so I thought. I applied the oil just to give it a try. A tiny squirt that I rubbed onto my fingers to easily distribute onto my face. The oil is light and had a soft scent that I'd describe as powdery with a hint of flowers. I massaged the oil in a circular motion onto my face and later removed it with a cotton ball, and to my amazement the cotton ball was dirty, ew! Mind you, I had not been using any makeup that day. This oil picked up dirt (most likely dead skin) that I didn't know was there! That's also why I use a cotton ball, so I can see what I've picked up. I later applied water to rinse off what was left of the oil and later washed my face again with a Korean brand of face soap that I ordered along with this oil. My face felt fresh and clean without any tightness or dryness. My skin type is: combination with an oily t-zone. I've been using this for several days now and it removes makeup so well. I just put a pump or two onto my fingers and massage the oil all over my face, concentrating on the areas where I applied makeup, remove the oil with a cotton ball, rinse my face with water, then apply face soap ( just started using a Korean brand) because I like to make sure everything is thoroughly clean. Just to let you know, the oil is light and watery. I would say that it's a dry oil and doesn't really leave you greasy like oils do (I can't read Korean so not sure if they would call it a dry oil, but it sure does feel that way). If you don't want to have it drip off of your fingers you could use a cotton ball or cotton pad to apply it onto your face.The oil came shrink wrapped and taped up in bubble wrap. There's a tiny stopper under the nozzle of the bottle that you remove to activate the pump. No packaging/box was with this face oil but it's alright with me, I can't read what it would say anyways. I included a photo of how my bottle arrived in the shrink wrap, which was pretty secure as the pump cannot be activated unless you remove the stopper, and the shrink wrap prevented the nozzle from turning during shipping.This oil is a great add to my daily cleansing routine and I'd order it again. This is a light oil cleanser. It has a soft plseantl floral type smell. To use this all I do is apply it to small makeup cotton pads. It removes dead skin and dirt from your face fairly easy as well as make up. I use a cotton pad by apply a small amount of this rice water to the cotton pad and then I wipe my face with another cotton and then I rinse off with like warm water. You wouldn't believe how dirty the cotton pad is even if you have washed your face prior to using this rice water. I believe it is a light dry oil cleanser. I recommend this to anyone who would like to use Korean skin care. This was my first venture to washing with oil and I am hooked!  I use one or two pumps of this oil and massage my face and neck in circular motion for up to two minutes.  I could literally see the make up, dry sweat if I worked out, and dirt coming off my face.  It has a very light scent.  This did the trick in helping me clear my face from minor acne.  I rinse it with warm water then cool water.  I use MISSHA First Treatment Essence afterward for toning and moisturizing followed by Vitamin C serum, eye cream, and MISSHA cell renew snail cream.  My skin is light brown with natural freckles and no acne problems.  I love this product, it cleanses and moisturizes.  My face is brighter and no worry about looking dull! This is the second oil cleanser I have ever used (the first was a Burt's Bees one, which was also a pretty decent product), but of the two this is the superior product. I use other products afterwards, so I can't say anything about how moisturizing it is, but what impressed me the most is that it removed ALL of my makeup (read foundation, concealer, etc., I'm not talking about eye makeup) in one go, which is something I had never truly experienced in any product before. When I swipe a cotton ball with toner over my face, nothing comes off onto the cotton ball, my face is completely clean. The other thing I like about this oil cleanser versus others is that the texture is so light. I would definitely recommend this product! This was the first oil cleanser i ever bought and I'm so thankful for trying this out! I absolutely love it. The scent is really nice and imo its not too strong. It takes a few splashes of water to rinse off completely and leaves my skin really refreshed and smooth!! The oil doesn't stick or is thick. its a nice, thin, smooth and velvety consistency that makes it feel really good on my skin. It cleared up my acne around my t zone and really works! I do recommend that you moisturize (or use a toner or serum) afterwards because my skin got a bit dry after awhile (maybe thats just me). If you are doing a multi step skincare routine, this is a great cleanser to start off your routine with and I highly recommend implementing this into your routine. Overall its a really good product. This smells great. I bought it and used it along with the Rice Water Bright Foaming Cleanser. I really like it and will buy it again. It's really not too oily. It feels a little oily on your hands but once you blend it into your cleansed face it is soft and not greasy. I have normal-semi oily skin and it was not greasy at all. I was super skeptical to purchase this item because I know very little about Korean skincare, but it was recommended by a Buzzfeed article (I know, I know), so I gave it a shot. First, the shipping was pretty speedy -- always nice -- and the product arrived undamaged. The packaging is nice, which I know matters to some folks. Now, the product. It has a subtle, floral scent. I really love it, but I know some folks prefer unscented. I was worried it would have chemical smell, so this is nice. The scent doesn't cause me any irritation and I have sensitive skin. Using an oil to remove makeup seems wonky, but we all remember high school chemistry - like goes with like. This removes a full face of daytime makeup with zero problems, including waterproof mascara and eyeliner (my biggest concern). Also, I don't feel like I am just pushing my makeup around my face, which is nice. It easily rinses clean with water and does leave my skin feeling a little hydrated, to the point that I won't put on a moisturizer right away. Overall, I'm pretty pleased. I was really excited to use this cleansing oil because there was so much hype about it and I would say this product is worth the hype. I use this cleanser at night to get my makeup off and then follow up with a cream cleanser. The oil is very thin so I usually one need to use one pump, sometimes I have a lot of makeup on I’ll use one and a half pumps. You just rub it into your face and your makeup comes off, I usually rub it on my face for 30 seconds and try to be very thorough. Then you add some water to your face and that makes the cleanser emulsify into a milky color. At this point I rub in the cleaner again with wet hands and work the emulsified liquid around my face. After that I finish off with a cream cleanser. This cleansing oil definitely needs to be with another face cleanser because there is noticeable residual oil after you rinse it off. I’m not sure if that’s to moisturize your face and it’s supposed to be like that but I’m not a fan of it and my skin is very acne prone so I follow up with a second cleanser. This is also great for getting all of your eye makeup off, it gets my eyebrow pencil, eyeliner, eyeshadow, and mascara off very easily and doesn’t make my contacts get cloudy like some cleansing oils (Shu Uemura…). The smell is a light floral scent that isn’t my favorite but it’s not that strong and it doesn’t linger so I’m okay with it. This cleanser lasted my 5 months and I used it once every day so it’s a great value. I didn’t notice a huge amount of brightening with my skin but I mostly purchased this just to remove my makeup so I didn’t really pay attention to that. Works great so far!! I've been using it for almost 3 weeks now and my skin has cleared up a lot from when I first started using it. Although stress makes my skin worse, the Biore Deep Pore Charcoal Cleanser made my skin so terrible, making my skin dry, flaky, broke out A LOT.This cleansing oil has helped my skin become less dry, I hope the flakiness from my past cleanser will go away soon. Skin texture is better now too, and it smells really good. Not too strong, a bit floral scent.I usually pump 3/4 pump into my hand and apply it on my face after removing my makeup first with a makeup wipe. I know this is meant to remove makeup but I just do it beforehand, and clean my face with the oil cleanser after and wash off with lukewarm water.It doesn't usually leave my face feeling oily and icky but some people do like to clean again with a foam cleanser or something, which I do sparingly. I am over 50 I have wrinkle & acne = ugh! I also have super sensitive skin with dry patches. I started going to the dermatologist at 14. The treatment was always to dry up the oil. The sun lamp treatments (WTH right?) B12 shots, antibiotics, hormone therapy I refused Acutane because they wanted me to sign a form stating that I would have an abortion if is conceived while on Acutane ... I was convinced that any oil touching my face would mean instant pimples. I now am a firm believer in oil cleansing. At first I did double cleanse, oil, warm wash cloths then finish up with a mild salicylic acid wash. Now I only do the salicylic acid gentle foam cleanse in the morning and this oil wash in the evening. I am SO glad I discovered this product! I have acne-prone skin, and nothing ever really seemed to help. Didn't matter if I stripped my skin or glopped on products, my face was always in a state of emergency. Honestly, I thought I was kind of throwing away money on this, but thought, what they heck? I've tried everything else!It's a little strange to wash your face with oil the first time, let me tell you. But it has this amazing power to get the crud and makeup off without irritating my skin, even waterproof mascara. The label says keep it away from your eyes but I go ahead and smoosh it around everywhere and it doesn't sting or anything. I follow up with a cleanser (not the Rice Water Bright cleanser as that was incredibly drying) and my Clarisonic and my skin has responded beautifully. I can even go out without makeup.Obviously, I can't promise you will have the same results, but if you have problem skin and nothing has worked for you, I think you should give this a try. I can't imagine being without it now. I started having a bad breakout this summer when I stopped taking the medication by dermatologist recommended (I was kinda scared of the side effects,that's why). So I did some research online and found something that's missing on my skin care regimen- cleansing oil. I found this cleansing oil from watching YouTube  and quickly ordered one from amazon. I could say that it's one of the best skin care products I have tried. My breakouts did not only disappear from one week of using it, but it has pretty much calmed down my sensitive skin. It does an excellent job in removing make up (I also use it for eye make up) and leaves my face feeling clean (but not dry) before I even use my facial cleanser. I have suffered from sunburn in my face from failure to use sunblock in the past, but this cleansing oil has some brightening effects that made my skin tone more even.The only downside I could think of is that it stings my eyes a little bit. But I have very sensitive eyes to begin with so I'm not sure if this happens to other users. The pros are much more helpful though.This is the first item from The Face Shop skin care line that I have ever used. But since I'm very impressed with this cleansing oil, I ordered their facial foam wash today at amazon. Hoping to get amazing results from this as well! This is my first oil cleanser.  I am very adventurous with skin care products so I was excited to try it, and I had a feeling it would work out well.  It has exceeded my expectations!  I noticed that a previous reviewer said to massage the oil all over your dry face for a while, then add in some water and massage some more.  I did exactly that, and I loved the way it felt and smelled because it felt very luxurious and smooth going on, and smelled faintly like a nice perfume.  very nice face washing experience.  I rinsed multiple times with water and my face felt smooth, soft, and clean afterwards.  I used a cotton ball with toner afterwards and noticed there was a faint trace of foundation on the cotton ball, but not much.  I decided that because of this I will do like many others have done and do the ""double cleansing method"" by using a foaming cleanser afterwards.  I purchased ""Shiseido Perfect Whip"" face wash, which is also on Amazon, and has a cult following I suppose.  (But my experience with this face wash is a different story for a different review). I'll probably end up using Cerave foaming facewash after this oil, because I have read that it is a good one to use with the double cleansing method after oil.  Anyways, I'm very pleased with this purchase, it feels very nice and rich, and makes your skin soft and moisturized.  Also, I'm acne prone and it is helping heal some pimples. I love this product because it loosens the makeup I use everyday. I have started the 2 step cleansing process and this is nirmally the first produxt I use at night. It isvery soothing as you massage it into the skin. I can see hiw it loosens my makeup especially in the eye area. It is very gentle to the face and I love the clean smell of it. Though it is an oil, it does not leave my skin oily and washes off after a do my second step using a foaming cleanser. The price is great compared to other cleansing oils in the korean market. I like to use this twice a day for my skincare regime. My favorite thing about it so far (apart from the rejuvenating, softening effects on my skin) is that it feels extremely nice and relaxing to use as a cleansing oil. It feels like a serum that's so smooth to massage in small circles into my skin. I am a Filipina with eczema on various parts of my face and this does a wonderful job of making my skin feel supple.I use the double-cleansing method, with this as my cleansing oil and then with a neutrogena gentle gel cleanser (followed by a few of the other steps in the Korean skincare process, ex. toning, face mask, etc.)It just feels good; it just feels so, so soothing during cleansing process that you can just smooth along your face in various patterns. Feels like it's not just cleansing your skin; it's replenishing and nourishing it as well. Just be careful not to waste lots of it! It's quite liquidy and can slip between the cracks of your fingers even when you clench them together tightly, so don't wait too long when transferring from the bottle to your face. Tip: when it drips through your fingers and through to the back of your hand, use the back of your hand to apply the dripping remaining amount of the pump to your face (so as to not waste) it ^^Thanks to Amazon for such fast shipping. It's my go-to for any of these skincare products that I can't get in any stores nearby. Love love love love love. My oily skin & heavy eyeliner screams thank you to Korea for their skin care witchcraft 💕 Most nights, I follow this with a foam cleanser, but when my face feels a little lackluster, I'll just clean with this & move on with my nightly routine! Not overly oily, even after rinsing off; easy to use, apply & wash off; takes off all my face makeup & most of my eye makeup without any stinging(!!!!) (I wear Stila liquid eyeliner because my lids are so oily & nothing gets it off at the end of the day without irritation like this stuff does!) I am in love with this oil! Not only does it help take off my makeup, but makes me feel hydrated as well. I use this as a first in my skin care routine, and it leaves my skin better prepared and cleaner for my next cleanser. My skin feels super soft, and not tight. I am oily/combo and my oil has slowly vanished after using this product. I am dry at the top of my forehead, my cheeks, and around my chin at the bottom. My nose and top of my chin is an oil slick. After using this product, my makeup is beginning to stay on longer because of the oil reduction, and using the TonyMoly Cat's Wink helps too. I was afraid to try this at first because I was scared my skin would break out, but it has been the total opposite. I like the floral smell, and it isn't too strong for me. A little goes a long way with this product. I use this twice a week and when I take off my makeup. I will definitely repurchase! Great way to remove makeup without having to use miscellar water or soap. I like the 3-10 step skin treatment plan and it includes makeup remover and face cleanser. This will remove your makeup but you need to use something like Cerave Foaming Cleanser to remove the oily residue. Do not use water to remove the oil, it will just push the makeup around your face and not remove it. I started a two step cleanse method and gave this a try after watching a Gothamista YouTube video where she recommends this. I love it!  One full pump and it literally dissolves my makeup and even my waterproof mascara with ease. I still need to remove the last bit of mascara with a little remover, but there's no rubbing involved and very little to remove. This oil is light and doesn't sit heavy on the skin. It even lathers up just a little (you can see the white film/slight froth), which I like. I prefer using it with my fingers instead of the konjac sponge, but that's just me. When my skin freaks out and gets greasy, this oil helps bring it all back under control. It's fantastic and gives me a light dewy finish and leaves my skin feeling well moisturized and clean and fresh. I double cleans every evening as part of my K-Skincare routine, and this baby just melts off my makeup. Liquid Liner, lip stain, and every spec of highlighter rinses away. I tend to have to use 2 pumps with full face, and one for a more casual day. No harsh scrubbing or elbow grease required, just gently massage then rinse. It's super gentle and calming for oily skin. First off, you need to apply this to dry skin! It can work off a lot of makeup and gunk off of your face which is great but I warn you*This is not meant to remove eye makeup* and should not be used around your eyes! I see a lot of reviews complaining about this burning their eyes so please be careful and read the packaging.You also need to follow up this oil cleanser with a FOAM cleanser. Many reviewers talk about it feeling like the product is still sticking to their skin after washing it off. That's because this is a Korean beauty product and it's common to ""double cleanse"". Use any of your favorite foaming cleansers after this and it will remove any excess oils.I have oily/combo skin and this is works perfectly for me. Many also complain about the scent, but as someone who is highly sensitive to smell I honestly can't smell much of anything from this! A great light weight oil cleanser that didn’t break my face out. I use it every time I wash my face. I don’t use it directly on my eyes because of previous reviews of it stinging. My skin is so soft after each use. I do use it with water and it makes a little foam. I would recommend this product. Love this facial cleanser! I ordered this since Morgan (TheBeautyBreakdown on YouTube) recommended this for folks with dry skin. It doesn't dry out my skin and washes off all my makeup. For reference, the makeup I typically wear that this product washes off are: BareMinerals mineral foundation, Tarte Amazonian Clay foundation, Maybelline Lash Sensational waterproof mascara, Essence black gel eyeliner, Wet 'N Wild waterproof liquid eyeliner. I've had trouble washing off the eyeliner products with past makeup removers but this rice water easily melts it away withour irritating my eyes. I massage this product all over my face, rinse with water, follow up with Neutrogena foam cleanser, and rinse again. My skin is so clean and I've ordered this product for 2 other people with dry/mature skin and they love it! This is a very light feeling oil and it removes all of my makeup very easily. It rinses off very well, so sometimes, if I'm not wearing makeup, I use only this as my cleanser, because its very moisturizing and gentler than my normal foaming cleanser. I'm going to buy this again and again. This was my first time purchasing this face wash and I really like it. I usually put it on a cotton ball and rub it all over my face and then rinse off the oil with warm water then towel dry. It leaves my face so soft and refreshed. Many other folks recommend using toner after, I'm not sure that is necessary, I like it as is I ordered this thinking it would be like any other liquid cleanser, where I rub it on my face, it foams and I wash it off.I was really surprised and dismayed in the beginning to see that it was some sort of cleaning oil. I decided to give it a try with a full face of make up and I was amazed! It too k off every trace of make up I had, including dark eye make up which for me is the hardest to remove. This cleanser does a great job of removing dirt.makeup etc without drying your face too much! In the beginning I used to rub this on my face and wash it off with warm water and then use my regular face wash, but my I have started noticing a difference in my skin texture and now just use this to wash my face and pat dry. Works great for me. I have oily skin with acne issues every now and then and this product is wonderful! I noticed a a reduction in oil production on my forehead and cheeks after I started using this product. I still get oily, but slightly less than before. I don't really use my makeup remover anymore, since this removes all of my make up and sunscreen. I just use the make up recover and a q-tip when I need to clean the eyeliner from between my lashes, since its hard to get to that spot with my finger. I've been using it for a month, once daily, and i'm less than 1/4 through the bottle, maybe 1/5? I use less than a full pump every time I use it. The texture is thin and oily and has a slight scent but that doesn't bother me. Amazing product!  I have serious blackheads that couldn't be extracted from those painful biore nose strips, however, using this product for a week and massaging my nose area has been so beneficial! You can actually see and feel the blackheads popping out over continuous use!  The smell is not too strong, and if washed off correctly with water it doesn't leave a scent.  It keeps my dry face well moisturized as well after use.  I recommend this product greatly! Second time buying this product. You think your cleansing routine got all the dirt and makeup off your face? Guess again!Use this with a cotton pad and be prepared to be very surprised and what washing AND exfoliating doesn’t get. I was hoping that this would be my new holy-grail product and I am so happy I wasn't let down.  I LOVE this stuff. It smells amazing, fresh, clean, maybe a little fruity?  It says 'oil' and me living in a humid part of the world and already having oily skin, I was nervous to try an oil cleanser.  I am so happy I gave this stuff a shot.  It isn't hick and 'oily' like a hair oil or vegetable oil, it is really light.  It feels almost like you are putting water on your face and it smells lovely. The smell isn't strong and doesn't linger on the skin, but it is noticeable when you put it on your face.  It just melts the makeup away. I love it. I used to go through one or two makeup remover wipes a night. This stuff is great because one pump rubbed into your face and eye-makeup dissolves and removes almost every trace of my makeup. I will take a wipe, tissue-paper, or warm water to get the oil off my face; which ever method I feel like using, they all work. Love, love, love this Rice Water Cleansing Light Oil! I had been using grape seed oil as my first step in cleansing since changing to the Korean method and was getting more and more breakouts during the summer so decided to try this oil as my first step. I am so happy I did!!!! I actually love how light it feels and how much make-up it removes. It takes one pump and then I massage it all over while my water gets hot (joys of living in an older home). I have noticed my face getting clearer and clearer and very soft. I have very large pore and it seems to be cleaning them out well and this combined with my other new regimen has made a drastic difference in the amount of oil my face produces and it has a healthy glow now! Would highly recommend this Face Shop Rice Water Bright Cleansing Light Oil and I will continue to use it for part of my night time regimen. I have been in the beauty and skincare industry for more than 22 years and have tried so many oil cleansers, the first one being DHC. This is the BEST. It has a lovely fresh scent, gently removes even stubborn makeup, and just feels amazing!I follow with Innisfree Green Tea Foaming Cleanser. I'm totally converted to oil + foam cleansers. I made the switch after having a bad allergic reaction to another unrelated product and not only is this much gentler on my skin (I pair it with Skin Food's Foam cleanser at night), but it makes taking off makeup a breeze. There is no scent and the act of putting it on is pretty relaxing.If you have sensitive skin, I recommend making the switch to oil + foaming cleanser. My skin is so much happier for the switch. I really  love this oil cleanser. I use it in my Korean skincare routine, and it seems to do quite a bit in the way of pulling dirt and keratin plugs out of my skin before washing up.I saw several people saying that it left them with oily skin after use, and I feel like it shouldn't need to be said, but just in case: You are supposed to use this cleanser in conjunction with a water based foaming cleanser. In fact, the Face Shop offers a foaming cleanser from the same Rice Water line. I haven't personally tried that one, I use this with the Mizon Snail Cushion Foaming Cleanser, but there's really no way you should have an oily face after using this cleansing oil properly... That is, with a foaming cleanser. It's an important step, don't forget it!So, I use this one at night for taking off makeup as well as prepping my pores for a water based cleanser, and I truly love it.My next step in skincare is ensuring that the pH levels of the products I use are truly compatible with human skin, so hopefully this holds up, but right now it works great! I've been trying different face cleansing oils and since I've started using Korean skin care productions I thought I'd try this one since it had such good reviews. And I'm not disappointed!  It's lighter than some which I really like. The smell is soft and pleasant. I use it as part of a two step cleansing and it really helps dissolve any makeup.The only negative was the plastic wrap around the bottle make the little black spout break off. I contacted Amazon and the seller gave me a partial refund which was really nice since I can still get the product out - it just doesn't look as nice and you have to aim it more carefully. But otherwise the wrapping was great - bubble wrapped for extra protection in the box. And it came much quicker than the stated shipping time.I've only used a few times so far but my face seems to like it! Just yes. Oh my, yes. This stuff is perfect. You only need a little tiny bit for your entire face. No more scrubbing and rubbing to get off the eyeliner. Plus, I think it smells super good. Some people were complaining about the smell, but I dig it. Yes honey yesssss! I love this cleansing oil. It is really effective at removing makeup and other gunk in your pores. For those of you who have never used an oil cleanser: Squirt the desired amount in the palm of your hand, rub palms together briefly (probably not necessary but I do it anyway) and begin rubbing in circular motions WITHOUT using water. It is so much more effective at getting out sebum and taking off make up if you spend a good couple minutes (at least) massaging your face in circular motions. Sometimes you can feel the sebum plugs (feel like little grits) coming out as you massage. Kinda gross but pretty amazing too. Once your oil cleanse is complete, rinse with warm (never hot) water and proceed with your favorite foaming cleanser. Love this oil cleanser. I'm a guy so I can't speak to how well it takes off makeup. It does do a great job of taking off sunscreen and excess oil. Love to use this after a day in the sun! It smells nice but it doesn't stick around at all especially if you use a foam cleanser right after, which you should. Takes stubborn make up off. I have been using this product over a year now. I love it gets rid of dirt and hard to remove make up. I wouldn't suggest it for the eyes. Before I deep clean I use this product I  swear by this stuff! THIS STUFF! IS PURE! MAGIC!!!!!!!!!!!I was so excited to use it I wore makeup for no reason on the day I knew it was coming, just so I could immediately put it to the test- it MELTS your makeup off, I look like a complete halloween horror lady after I'm done rubbing it into my skin, with my eye makeup everywhere. Just one pump provides enough oil for my entire face- and after cleansing toner has a much harder time finding left overs on my face. Absolute must, works better than the garnier cleansing water for me- and the cleansing water is also 5 stars out of 5!!! Works like a charm! Not too oily, gets rid of all my makeup and feels great on my skin! Oil cleansers are a must have and this is a great one! Plus I love all things Korean Beauty, you can't go wrong. I had just ran out of my History of Whoo oil cleanser that used for make up removal but it's very expensive and I was looking for something more affordable so I tried this. Like every of product I've tried from The Face shop, it is quality. It's powers through a full face of makeup with ease. I use a exfoliating cotton pad (this makes a huuuge difference in how much makeup it takes off) and wipe the oil off, along with my make up. After that I use a foam cleanser and then proceed with the rest of my skincare routine. I absolutely will be purchasing this products again! Truly excellent shipping time and many free samples from Innisfree that I love!As for the product, the smell is overwhelmingly flowery. It reminds me of that sweet, harsh chemical cockroach poison smell. I could smell it on my face throughout the day! I love how it cleans, though. It sloughs off dead skin that really helps with acne. It's a watery, slippery oil that emulsifies lightly and leaves a nongreasy finish. I always use 4% benzoyl peroxide wash afterwards though. Of course the price is great, very affordable. My favorite oil cleanser is still the Salma Hayek Calendula Oil Cleanser that is now sadly discontinued. Cleans makeup off quickly and leaves skin feeling fresh. I prefer this over any makeup removal wipes. Great for removing my makeup at the end of the day all in one go, then doing a double cleanse. Not sure how well it would work with a lot of makeup as my personal preference is just a little tinted moisturizer, concealer, light coating of eyeshadow and eyeliner. On the rare occasions I do wear mascara, it does a great job getting 98% of it off. I usually do a courtesy sweep with a q-tip and some coconut oil or jojoba oil on the lashline to get any remaining residue, but it does a better job than my facial wipes + foam cleanser + q-tip routine. Very lightly scented, I find it pleasant, but don't have allergies to fragrances so not sure on that front. I would recommend it. I received this product 4 days late so I wasn't really happy about that. The bottle came in plastic wrap and bubble wrap. When I opened it there was an oily residue on the outside of the bottle because it had apparently leaked but it wasn't really a big problem.I've used it to remove makeup from my hand and eyes and it works really well. It only takes a few seconds before the makeup dissolves. It's really gentle and did not sting my eyes at all. I haven't used an oil cleanser before so I don't have anything to compare it to but I really like it. It smells a lot like Skin Food's Rice Mask Wash Off. It's a really light scent and shouldn't bother you at all. I don't usually bother with face cleansing products and only rinse my face with water because I'm happy with my skin and products tend to aggravate my skin (well, I'm lazy as well), but this cleansing oil is serious business. I have normal-combination skin and it's been really great for my dryer skin this winter without making my skin oily. It also doesn't make my skin itch or breakout. I just use two pumps of the oil, warm it between my hands, and massage into my face. I then follow with a Cetaphil cleanser. Together they make a really effective skincare routine.When I use a makeup remover and/or face cleanser, I would still have mascara and eyeliner left behind which made me look like a raccoon. However, when I use the cleansing oil and a cleanser, there is no leftover eye makeup. The smell is also very light and pleasant so it doesn't bother me. I am very much a believer in oil cleansing now! Leaves my skin feeling super soft and hydrated! so gentle! though I definitely recommend using a foam cleanser after to help get off the leftover oil and/or any left over makeup and dirt.It can leave a oily feeling if you don't take the time to properly rinse it off your face. MY SKIN LOVES THIS PRODUCT. It cleans off all my makeup, except sometimes my waterproof mascara. It smells wonderful, like fresh flowers, and my skin doesn't feel sensitive after. I recommend it to anyone who has sensitive skin. I have combo skin and it works wonders. try it for yourself! so moisturizing! This has become a holy grail product in my nightly skincare routine, and it's a great price too! My skin is so soft after using this, but you still should use a moisturizer afterwards. The scent is light and sweet, and I do not mind it at all.Gets off the hardest-to-take-off lip stains and waterproof mascara from a long day. I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS STUFF!!!! This item is one of my holy grails. I can not tell you how good this stuff smells. I mean i want to put it all over my body. I put it on my dry face when i am ready to take my makeup off. I pump some into my hands and in circular motions put all over my face. It makes my makeup melt away. It gets every drop of makeup off of my face. I then go in with my regular face wash and clean my face after. I also got the foaming face wash that goes with this and i loved it too. I still use it with a pore brush of soft to gently exfoliate. I will never wash my face again without first taking my makeup off with this stuff. I STRONGLY recommend this product. I mean, what would we even do without Korean beauty supplies? Just go around with huge pores all day, I guess. This mess is amazeballs. Removes all my makeup and even my waterproof mascara. I bought this and the Banila Clean It Zero sherbet cleanser. I think both do a good job at removing all make up, also I think the Banila Clean It Zero does a slightly better job while using less product. I usually use about 2-3 pumps of this in the shower and massage all over my face. Because this is also in an oil form, I have a problem with it running down my arms and I feel like I'm losing product that way. However, for the price, I really can't complain. The Banila Clean It Zero is more expensive, but you don't lose any product with it like you do with this Face Shop product. This stuff is the BOMB. It liquified every ounce of makeup or grime on my face and takes it with it when it's washed off. It does take a good bit of rinsing to remove and you'll definitely want to use another water based cleanser afterwards to make sure you have all of the oil off, but for this price nothing else even compares. There are some better oil cleansers out there but they charge a pretty penny, at least double this price. This stuff is great for what it costs, I encourage buying it! (And it smells pretty nice too) This is a light weight oil cleanser. I use this as step one of my double cleanse routine. It gets all of the makeup and sunscreen off without being harsh and doesn't sting eyes, which surprised me. It does have a bit of fragrance so should be avoided if you're sensitive to that. I love this stuff and you can't beat the price. I've been using this for 3 days and I can already see the results. At first I was afraid that since it's oil, it may clog my pores and break me out from adding a new cleanser into my routine but it did quite the opposite. The oil is very light, it removed most of the makeup I wore (eyebrow, eyeliner, highlighter) and it cleansed my pores to the point my acne receded and I saw an improvement in my skin texture and skin tone in just 3 days! After using this once, I immediately knew I loved it and bought the foam cleanser as well.Cons- the scent is a little too overwhelming for me By far one of the best cleansing oils I've ever used. Smells amazing, I just massage on my face morning and night with water. Melts all makeup and takes away any excess oil or sebum. It's a must have in the ten step Korean skincare routine! I Love This!!! I'm 32yrs old going on 33 in a few months and noticed my skin dries out faster than it did in my twenties... So I've had to revamp my skin regime since hitting my thirties! Lol... This has been a great add to my skin care routine... Leaves my skin feeling so nice!! It takes off the most stubborn of makeups! I use everything waterproof, mascara, liquid eyeliner, etc... It has absolutely no problem getting those babies off without me having to over rub my face! During winter I simply rinsed off... During summer I will go over it and wash it off with some light soy cleanser... I Love It! Broke me out, but besides that, this is an amazing oil cleanser. It really takes off your waterproof makeup. It does have a heavy fragranced smell, and it does go away after rinsing. It took a while to get used to it. Besides that it is still good although it didn't work for me. Make sure you patch test before incorporating into your skincare routine. As a beauty junkie, I am constantly trying new things - but I just bought my second bottle of this cleanser because it's AWESOME.It completely removes all of my makeup, even the waterproof mascara, effortlessly.I was initially concerned about using an oil cleanser on my skin, which is combination/oily - but this one didn't break me out or make me more oily, just left my skin soft and comfortable.I should note, however, that I do ""double-cleanse"" (follow up the oil cleanser with a foam cleanser) in the evening, after I've been wearing makeup.In any case, this is a new favorite! This is my second time purchasing this because I loved the first bottle that much. I started the Korean trend of double-cleansing about 6 months ago and love the way it makes my face feel. I have combo/oily skin and find that if I use this first and massage it into my skin followed by my usual face wash, my skin feels plump, hydrated, and clean without making me extra oily throughout the day. It feels silky smooth when I rub it into my face and the process is very relaxing. It doesn't irritate my skin or cause breakouts, not for me anyway. I highly recommend this for any skin type! For someone with severe cystic acne and enough oil on my face to heat a house i was worried this was going to make me break out or just make me more oily. I didn't want t spend a ton of money on brand name cleansing oils (Its just a makeup remover for crying out loud) but i wanted something that did the job and did it well. I am pleasantly surprised that this literally makes any makeup on your face just melt away and did not seem to make me break out (anymore that i normally do anyway). One thing i didn't like is that it seems to irritate my eyes when i use it to get off mascara....i cant see out of my eyes for a few seconds and have to keep wiping and rinsing several times . Other than that its wonderful! This product is great for removing make up. I tend to use mascara that is hard to remove on the eyes and this product helps remove my eyes makeup easily.Pro:•Easy to use•Remove make up on your face•Oil based•Good for dry skin (also oily skin, I have oily skin but it does not oil out my skin)Con: Would last 2-3 months the most! (This only applies to people who needs to clean their make up daily like me)To seller: Thank you so much for shipping them out on time! I appreciate it. My daughter has me hooked on the Korean step facial care. I put a pump of this oil on a cottonball and smooth it over my face every morning and evening. I replace the cotton balls when they are dirty, but do not add any more oil. The smell is wonderful- kind of flowery but not strong. I rinse it off a few times and then follow up with the Face Shop cleanser. I have dry skin, and this product works great. It is not too oily and leaves my skin super soft. I love it and buy it regularly. Highly recommend. I'm almost 40 and have never taken good care of my skin. I have suffered from occasional breakouts and unrelenting whiteheads throughout my 30's. When I use this morning and night my makep gets completely removed and I start and end the day with baby soft clear skin that makes me look five-years younger. It's a daily spa facial and it simplifies the routine. Best thing I have ever put on my face. I'm still fairly new to Korean beauty products, but this one that always seemed to be on the top lists when trying to find the products best fit for me. I have oily skin with hormonal breakouts. I really love this cleansing water. Yes, it's oily, but it doesn't leave my skin super oily. It does an amazing job of removing my makeup and leaves my skin feeling very soft.This works so much better than  using a standard cleanser.I have recommended this cleansing rice water to several people and they've all had good results with it. My HG cleansing oil. I've ordered this from Amazon multiple times and have only had 1 issue (and it wasn't w/ the product itself).Works great, removes my HG WP mascara, and does not break me out. I did have to contact the seller because by the time it reached me, half of the product had leaked into my package with my OST C20 Vitamin C Serum. The seller did provide a refund.I have normal-dry Asian skin and I love the light scent and how it doesn't dry me out when I finish cleansing. It doesn't necessarily get ""foamy"" but it is definitely something that can be lathered. I love this face oil! It melts away my face and eye make up completely! It doesn't sting or burn my eyes and it works better than the average make up remover. I will definitely be buying this again! I use this cleansing oil as part of a double cleansing routine. If I was using only this product I would probably say it leaves too much oily residue for my normal skin type.  However as part of the double cleansing routine this is a home run.  Affordable and effective, this product dissolves all my makeup (including eye makeup) and loosens up all the dirt of the day. I follow up with a nice creamy cleanser and I'm golden!  Shu Uemuras cleansing oil is my ultimate favorite but it is quite pricey.  This comes awfully close and I'm not afraid to use a good amount because I can afford it! Rock on! This face oil is a great price. It is very watery when you squirt it so I use a cotton ball to apply it to my face, then wash my face with cleanser after using the oil to remove my makeup. It works great, is very moisturizing, and doesn't cause me to break out (my break outs actually happened less after starting using this! This light cleansing oil works great on my oily skin. I use it first to take off all of my make-up, even my waterproof mascara. It rinses off quickly and then I use my face wash. Using it this way, it doesn't leave an oily residue. When I use this cleansing oil before using my face wash I find that I don't have mascara, eye liner, or foundation left over in my pores or on my face. Removed my foundation easily.  I was going to get the brand zero, but didn't want to pay so much money.  This product is just perfect and affordable! Makeup literally melts off of your face.  I only wear waterproof mascara and it literally just glides off your lashes with this stuff.  I have oily/combo skin. I've been researching skin care recently and decided to give ""The Face Shop Rice water Bright Cleasing Oil"" a try. I LOVE IT. It smells nice. It's light. Not very greasy. I massage my dry face with it...gently rubbing any makeup and mascara off with it. Then i use warm water and rinse. I have dry skin so I don't use another cleanser afterwards. I think my complexion looks so much nicer now that I've been using this cleaner for the past 2 weeks. Great product! I received this product before expected--so their shipping's totally reliable. The product itself is very strong! It will pull out oil from your skin! That is however, the goal right? I only use is once every two wks. Also, I don't use it like a face wash. I did that the first time and quickly learned it will dry you up. What I do now, is use a cotton b all and dab some on, then treat certain oily/acne areas only. Then, I'll use a cleaner like neutrogena or biore for my entire face. A more gentle thing to use is their lip and eye make up remover. After using makeup remover wipes, I use this to get the rest of the makeup that the wipes missed. It works amazing! When I rinse my face with this wash, the water color is murky because it takes all  the foundation off my face. It's a watery formula so it does run through my fingers if I'm not careful enough and it has a strong floral scent, which I could smell all day but some may not like fragrances in their face wash. I highly suggest using a second quick wash with a gentle face soap however so that your skin doesn't feel oily. Double-washing is actually a very common practice in South Korea and it has made such a huge difference in my skin cleanliness.Bottom line: highly recommend! This stuff is great. I use it to take off my foundation. Don't use it on the eyes cuz it burned like hell. But it smells great, is very light, and didn't break me out. I live in Louisiana where the climate is mostly hot and very humid and my skin is more on the oily side. This stuff didn't leave me excessively greasy, but i do use a foaming clearer right after to clean up any residue. I like to massage it onto my skin for about a minute or two and it's very relaxing. Didn't notice to much of a difference as far as brightening or help with discoloration, but i wasn't too worried about that. Will definitely buy again. I am just getting started with Korean beauty products and I will say that this is an amazing product.  My skin is so clean and soft I use it twice a say first thing in morning and as double cleansing in night. I know some people may think that is little too much. But after lot of trial and error I have been able to find a solution for my oily skin, also I use serums, emulsions, eye cream and moisturizer in night that might cause a little shiny oily skin in the morning, but twice daily works perfect for me.Use it for a month and your acne will slowly decrease (the ones due to oily or clogged skin, NOT HORMONAL ACNE)one pump is more than enough I've struggled for years to find a way to remove my eye liner and mascara effectively, and had some luck with dual phase removers, but I like this even more. Just one pump massaged onto my face takes off all of my makeup, even my mascara (even with my primer) and my longest-lasting eyeliners!  It has a light cherry blossom scent, but it isn't very noticeable.  I also tend to have sensitive and acne prone skin, but this hasn't bothered my skin at all.  I just use a foam cleanser afterwards to remove the excess oil and head to bed! Very pleased with this oil cleanser! I use it before my cream foaming cleanser and together they work brilliantly. All you really need is one pump to clean the entire face. I've noticed my face is brighter after using it, which is a huge plus. It definitely helps in terms of a total facial cleanse and in terms of invigorating lackluster/dull skin. It's also a fairly big bottle, so you get a great value in terms of what you pay for. Super satisfied and will totally repurchase when I run out. I love this oil cleanser. It is by far my favorite and a lot cheaper and better smelling than other more expensive brands. A little goes a long way so the bottle will last awhile and it really does get off all my makeup including most eye makeup. My face is smoother and more youthful and never greasy from this product. It actually removes all the dirt and grease from my face! The face shop has a lot of really great products for an affordable price, their shipping is also pretty darn fast;) My makeup melted away the second I began using this oil-based cleanser. I have mild rosacea (sensitive) and oily, hormonal acne-prone skin, but this product did not worsen these conditions as of yet. After cleansing, my skin felt supple and soft. There is a mild fragrance to this product but it did not cause any irritation. I cannot speak of long-term effects, but so far so good! Amazing product. It is light but removes all the debris and makeup off my face. It also has a wonderful refreshing scent. I love love this product. Will be buying again.. Really impressed with this product. The texture is slightly different from other cleansing oils I've tried (DHC, Josie Maran, Tatcha, Boscia), it is very thin, almost water-like. It seems to 'absorb' into the skin yet it immediately breaks down makeup. It rinses totally clean, leaving the skin feeling cleansed though not stripped. Definitely a great first cleanse appropriate for most skin types (those with VERY dry skin might be dissatisfied due to the thin, watery texture). It does contain fragrance - a sort of fresh floral - that doesn't bother me (I'm hyper-sensitive to certain fragrances) nor does the scent linger. I absolutely love the scent of this cleanser. I used to use The Body Shop's Camomile Cleaning Oil, and this one is a lot lighter and runnier. It's very easy to use up a lot of product very quickly. My skin feels very clean and fresh after washing with my CeraVe cleanser, and all makeup is gone! got this for my step mom - she is a complete skin snob - everything she gets is super high-end over priced stuff and she hasn't stopped raving about this for a week lol - says nothing has ever made her skin feel like it This is a very good product. It cleanses my skin without drying it out or burning. The smell is really strong but not a bad smell. And works well with the rice water cleanser. My skin feels super smooth will reorder after I finish this one. This smells GREAT! It really does work well to clean ALL of my makeup off, including my eyes. My skin feels so soft after I wash with this face oil. I have recently been introduced to the double cleanse concept. I wash my face with the foaming wash of the same brand after I clean my face with this cleansing oil to completely clean my face at the end of every day. I use an oil cleanser to remove oil based debris- sebum, makeup, sunscreen. I use a foaming wash afterwards to remove water based debris- sweat and dirt. My face is squeaky clean when I walk out of the shower- no more raccoon eyes. I've just started making a routine after years of treating my skin terribly, and my skin type is combination/dehydrated. This oil helped clean my clogged pores that I had, and feels like you're getting a face massage when using it. There's no residual oily feeling to my skin afterwards, and it removes all of my makeup a lot more effortlessly than my wipes. So overall, this really worked for my skincare regime. My face is dry and extremely sensitive, my cheeks are constantly a little red, and right after a shower my face is very splotchy. I thought maybe it's the soap (Neutrogena Naturals Cleanser) I'm using that's drying out my skin even more. So I tried a go at this on dirty/makeup face with no cleanser and I was paranoid that it wouldn't get my face clean enough. But surprisingly it does the job really well, my face was still a little splotchy but my skin felt a lot softer/less dry. It caused no reactions so I looked at the ingredients and one of the top ingredients is jojoba oil.. which explains why it conditions my skin so well. I thought it would be thicker like an oil but it is actually more watery? in consistency which I actually think is better. Removes makeup really well even my waterproof mascara and I have dry/combination skin but it left my skin really soft and moisturised after using it. I use 1-2 pumps for my face and neck. I also notice I get less spots after using it for 1/2 weeks. I would buy this product again~ Love this! I wanted to try it for a week or two before I wrote a review, and I was definitely amazed. It's thin enough that it doesn't feel weird that oil is on your face, but does a great job at removing makeup. I've never had any breakouts or issues with this, and it leaves my skin feeling smooth and moisturized as opposed to many harsh cleansers. This has been a game changer in my routine. After a long day at work I like to wash off my face from all of my makeup and usually I have a hard time taking it off. Once I started using this I've noticed that it really breaks down all on my makeup and helps wash everything off so much better and my skin doesn't get all ugly and dried out afterwards either. I really love this product. absolutely love this cleanser.  face feels clean, not that tight feeling. This protect is fantastic. I've been using it for a month and a half now. I'm amazed at how effective it is at removing make up. I also use it over my eyes (as it is gentle enough). All you need is one pump. Definately getting more value for your money.The only disadvantage was I had to wait about 1 month for shipment. I live in New Zealand so it does explain the delay. But can't complain with free shipping. So, I’m pretty much blown away by this product. My skin looks brighter after I use it, and I’ve actually taken to using it as a face mask when my skin is dry. The results are better than most actual face masks I’ve used. It’s great for sensitive skin, very gentle. I think if you want to try it out, start with the light oil, and get the rich if you need heavier moisture from you cleanser. All in all, this is an A++ product and I will be devastated if it is ever discontinued. This my go to Pre-cleanser I am loving this product it is lightweight and really breaks down my foundation and mascara this stuff is truly amazing i have had major breakouts for years huge red lumps under my skin and after using this for two days my  bumps are becoming smaller and disappearing i had tried every face wash and oil imaginable so i wasnt really thinking this would be any different i figured i would just have to deal with it for the rest of my life...im so happy ive finally found a solution to my skin problem i hope they never discontinue this thank you Works really well i never felt and looked so clean when i use other cleansers american/korean this one is just the best so far, it takes a while to wash off the oil but i really like how my skin glows and looks healthier since using this and doing double cleansing with the Sum 37 together works! great price too. After reading an article on Buzzfeed about Korean beauty products I had to try this. Cleansers in the past have left my skin red, sore, and stinging. This product did none of those things. In fact, it had kept my skin soft and supple since I purchased it. I'm also amazed at how such a mild product can clean off makeup better than any makeup removed I've ever used. A product I will purchase again and again. This product is AMAZING!! It even got rid of my waterproof mascara without pulling out any of my eyelashes!! Amazing product! Leave my skin feeling hydrated clean and soft. this product is awesome to use on my stubborn eyeliner. i take this cleanser and use it to get off my makeup, then follow up with my cleanser of choice. this works like a charm. Really makes my face feel amazing and since it's an oil it really brings the moisture back in my face. (Not that it matters but it smells wonderful also). I started using this product while I was pregnant because the hormones made me break out, it really help clear it up. This is one of the most amazing face cleansing product I have used so far ( and let's not forget the amazing price) and I have used many. I use this before using a foaming cleanser. I massage my face with this oil which takes care of the makeup and then wash it with Luke warm water. I follow this routine with a foaming cleanser ( I am using The face shop Rice water foaming cleanser right now and loving it). It's definitely non- commodogenic and does not dry out the skin. Smells sooo good. Great makeup remover. I usually use charcoal soap after using this product. Then I use my shiseido toner and moisturizer. My skin feels great. Lasts forever and is really affordable! Love this product.Since This is my first Korean beauty product, i wasnt completely sure on how it may effect my skin, and to double that up i have dry skin.The product works like a magic, i tried it after my bath and i used cotton just to see what all the hype was abt (prev reviews on this products by other customers )  and i was amazed.i think i am ready to try out more Korean beautyProducts. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! It gently lifts the makeup off, and my face feels cleansed without over-drying. Myself and my two sisters all use this along with the foaming cleanser and moisturizing toner. It’s worked wonderfully! Fantastic product. I purchased this at the end of July and use 2 pumps daily to remove my makeup before foam cleansing with Clarisonic. One pump doesn't remove enough makeup. At this rate, $10 bottle should last 6 months. I was pleasantly surprised since I was skeptical about using even more oil on my face but my skin feels smooth and soft after using. Will purchase again for sure. It's gentle on my skin, and it makes it feel super soft. It does have a slight scent to it for those who may not like scented products, but it's not over bearing (in my opinion.)I also have combination skin which is prone to breakouts during the summer, and during colder months my skin becomes more dry. I think it does better for when my skin is dry. Skeptical at first but ended up loving it. Now it's a staple. The oil itself is a really light texture but removes my waterproof mascara that I wear daily gently and completely. I use it at night as a makeup removed and in the morning with a foam cleanser and it leaves my skin smooth and clean. I only wish it came in a bigger bottle. I use about two pumps per day - it's about 1 pump to 1.5 to completely remove my mascara. I freaking love this stuff! It is super gentle, tightens up my pores, smells great and removes my waterproof mascara. My face feels silky smooth with a matte finish after I wash it off. I usually follow up with the Peach Sake Emulsion by Skin Food (which seems to absorb better if I use it directly after rinsing off the cleanser). A little bit of this stuff goes a long way. A half pump is plenty for your face. I have had it for a couple months, use it almost every day and I haven't reached the halfway point in the bottle. 10/10 would buy again. As an oily faced girl, it is soooo counter intuitive to use an oil based cleasnser. To say I was reluctant doesn't even begin to explain how I felt in the beginning.  And yet, I'm hooked. It is step 2 in a 5 or 6 step process. (I'm  working my way up tp a 10 step routine). I'm 2 weeks in & my y skin is definitely undergoing a transformation that I am enjoying. Very satisfied w/this product! I'd say this is a ""go for it!"" It cleans my face better than any makeup remover and it doesn't irritate my face even though I have sensitive skin and rosacea. I love the product and would use again. The only downside is that it is super watery but the outcome doesn't bother me at all seeing as how effective the product is! Best stuff for controlling oil!  I was skeptical about using oil to control oil but after years of trying to find something that would keep my face from getting all oily before the end of the day, I've finally found a product that works.  I used to be able to make til about 2p before my face would start to feel greasy, but after using this, I don't get that greasy feeling until 9p or 10p.  And that's in the Texas heat & humidity.  Probably works even better during the cooler seasons. I'm shocked! I've combatted oily skin, acne, enlarged pores, toning issues, dark spots, etc forever. I've used everything I could think of, and then I heard how great Korean skincare products are--and this stuff is awesome! Despite it being oily, it helps to remove my makeup, moisturizes my skin and definitely brightens up my overall complexion. --Immediately-- after using it the first time, my boyfriend commented on how great my skin looked. Love this stuff! Love this cleansing oil!  Takes all my waterproof mascara and everything off gently.  I used to buy DHC cleansing oil which was way thicker and heavier than this one, not to mention double the price.  This one is much better, economically and performance. Love this cleansing oil. Subtle smell of rose petals and is soft and refreshing. You do have to wash with regular face wash or else your face will be oily. I have been new to cleansing, and have to say that The Face Shop Rice Water Bright has definitely made my combination skin feel luxuriously soft. After I rinse it off, the moisturizing feeling lasts. I use this now as the first part of my routine followed by The Face Shop Bright Cleansing Foam. I bought this item from JOLSE, who I recommend as an excellent seller from South Korea. Will definitely buy this cleansing oil again! My go to oil cleanser! Love it! Lightweight, super moisturizing. Leaves skin clean and healthy! I have super super dry skin and this stuff is the bee's knees! If you are looking for an easy way to remove your makeup while cleansing your face, then this is you best option. I have a dry and sensitive skin and this works the best for my skin. I can describe how this product literally saves me after a long day with make up on. It clears my skin in seconds and removes stubborn eye make up and eye linear easily. It smells soothing and light and its texture is not too oily whatsoever. I am buying this oil cleanser for the forth time now and I have no regrets. This oil cleaner is wonderful! It melts the makeup right off my face and smells fantastic. It doesn't leave my skin feeling filmy or greasy, just soft. I use this as part of a two step cleansing process- this first and then an acne wash and it has really helped curb my breakouts. I do wish the product was more easily contained, I feel like you lose a lot of it between the pump and your face. Sometimes to help that, I will mix this with a pump of Cerave cream cleanser for a more substantial wash. Great scent! Gently removes dirt and makeup without any skin reactions. Very pleased with this product. This is a great product to remove your makeup. It works exactly like the MAC cleansing oil. I wear a lot of waterproof mascara and it cleaned it right off. Use this as first step on cleansing. You have to follow it with your other skin cleansing routine and follow instructions on how to use this product or any other cleansing oil. Search YouTube for demos if you're not sure on how to use cleansing oils. Much happy, very favorite(SERIOUSLY I love it. It takes off the battle armor- even mascara and heavy eye makeup- without burning, stinging, or feeling greasy. I rinse it off, but a warm washcloth would do the job too.Pump bottle makes it fast and easy to get the right amount without spilling, or to apply to cotton rounds. Definitely my go to from now on.) This stuff cleans off everything like magic. This product does a great job at removing my makeup. I clear off my entire face with a little bit of cleansing oil on a cotton pad, rinse with water, and then cleanse with my regular facial cleanser. This product does a great job at cleaning out my pores and leaving my face with a soft feeling. It takes a bit more effort than regular cleansers to remove it though, so if you are not going to cleanse again, I recommend using a washcloth. I am very satisfied and have just ordered another being that I have run out of my first batch. Great product. I use it as the first step in my skincare routine to clean my face and remove makeup (I even remove my eye makeup with it) and it works great! One bottle goes a long way. I have used 2 bottles in 7 months and I just received my 3rd one today. Work great. Love it. This thing is the best. I have combination/oily skin and this always leaves my face feeling super smooth and it smells nice but not perfume-y. I use two cleansers (the other ones a bit drying and then i use this one) so I don't know if that has anything to do with my somewhat oily skin not becoming more oily which is what I thought would happen. Anyway can't sing it enough praises and it is super cheap! I never really liked using watery/ oil cleansers but this is by far the best cleanser I've tried! After using it my face does feel clean, look clean and smells absolutely amazing! I use this every night right after I finish all my other routines. Its now one of my must haves and will be buying again pretty soon. I'm not certain the claims of brightening the skin are accurate, however I think this is a great oil to mix with vitamin C powder and or other exfoliants as it softens the skin thus allowing the exfoliation process to occur easier. I will be ordering more! Very nice, gentle product!  Melts even my most stubborn mascara (i.e. Benefit's ""They're Real Mascara"") right off!  I use this as step 1 as part of a double cleansing method and can really tell the difference in terms of how much makeup is leftover after cleansing/how clean my skin feels if I do not use this product!  It does tend to sting a little if it gets into your eyes, so you'll want to be careful, but it's nothing so bad I'd want to stop using this. I bought this as part of my nightly Korean-style skin care routine. I use it in the double cleanse step and it pairs well with the foaming cleanser from the same line. It is lightly oily and not overwhelming. It removes makeup amazingly! I have sensitive skin and eczema but this product does not irritate it at all. It may be different for you but I would recommend it for those starting out a new skin regimen. This does a great job of removing my makeup! I put a bit onto a dampened cotton ball and a little goes a long way. It does not make my skin greasy, and I do have oily skin. I was using Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser every day after using this, but I have started only cleansing three to four times a week because the cleanser was drying out my skin and is not necessary after this non-greasy formula. You may have different results but I quite like it This stuffs great!  It takes my waterproof eyeliner and mascara off with ease.  It only takes one pump to get my entire face with it and half a pump if you only want to get your eyes.  I also really like that it doesn't sting my eyes at all like some eye make up removers do.  I only use this at night so I'm not sure how it would be under make up (although I don't think you probably need to use it in the morning unless you slept in your make up...). The oil cleanser is thin and runny like water. I'm not particular about scent, but it smells pleasantly.  It removes make up effectively. Heavy makeup requires a toner-soaked cotton pad to remove the extra residue. Excellent Best cleanser, for my dry skin, ever!I have used MANY different cleansers... gels, lotions, creams, etc. but this is the only one that does EVERYTHING I have ever wanted. This cleanses my skin, takes every bit of make up (even waterproof) off, and moisturizes my skin all in one product. I will use this for the rest of my life. If the other products from the face shop are as good as this cleansing oil I'd absolutely love to give them a try! This is amazing for the skin. I was skeptical because of my acne, but other cleansers either dried out my skin or didn't pick up makeup. This stuff melts away your makeup and leaves skin smooth and hydrated. Now I will say that it doesn't clean off mascara very well, but that can be fixed with some toner. By far, the most gentle face wash I have ever used. I switch between this and my other face wash meant to clear up acne. My other one tends to dry up my skin so much and always makes my face feel really tight in an unpleasant way but this rice water cleanser is completely the opposite. It feels so light but still removes the majority of my make up AND my face feels nice and soft afterward. It's like a cleanser and a moisturizer in one. LOVE this cleanser. The oil is very light and my skin is full of moisture after using. I love this so much! I've been using it for about a month but fell in love the first time I used it. The first time I had like sand or some grit on my skin and was surprised! Because no one expects that on their face... I really do like to use it to clean my face. I do think it has contributed to my skin being brighter but I've done an overhaul of my skin routine.. so it is hard to tell. But I would definitely give this a try if you have the chance! Great product! I have purchased this several times and I will continue to do so. Very light weight, yet take off all of the makeup with little effort. Great product, great price!!! This is so light compared to my own concoction of face oils that I was trying out.  There is a very light fragrance, which I enjoy while I'm using this on my face every night. I usually take one pump of oil and use circular motions on my face for a good three minutes. I follow up with a light cleanser just because I am paranoid of using oil. So far, it's been great! I would most likely buy again if I run out. I love this oil! It gets off mascara. I pump a little onto a cotton pad and gently press into my eyelids and with minimal rubbing, it comes off! I then wash my face with this oil and the remaining residue disappears. I then wash my face with a cleanser and my face feels so clean. I have dry skin normally, but even in these winter months I do not get itchy irritated skin anymore. I've never used an oil based cleanser before, except the clinique makeup remover. I have been pleased with this product. It is very light, doesn't leave a heavy oil residue on my face, and seems to remove a lot of the grit of the day. I've been following this product with a foaming cleanser, and the combination has been very helpful at keeping my skin on an even keel. This product is amazing! It's not like any other cleansing oil that I've tried. If you wear thick layers of makeup and eyeshadow, this product is perfect!. Also if you want to emulsify the cleansing oil ( to make it a little bit creamy ) just add a little bit of water to your palm or wet your face. I have oily skin and this is fantastic. It has a wonderful light, clean scent that isn't too powerful. It is much easier on the skin than the regular baby oil I use and it doesn't have a heavy oily residue after use. I agree with some of the other reviewers that it does burn my eyes slightly but as long as you try to avoid massaging it into your lids I think you'll live. Love this product and only disappointed I didn't find it earlier! Literally the best cleansing oil ever. I have used cleansing oil off and on through out the last few years, but non have compared to this one. It's consistency is lighter than most cleansing oil, but just as effective. A little goes a long way. It melts oil based impurities like sebum, and completely removes my SPF at the end of the night. The seller and shipping was perfect. perfect cleansing oil for the double cleanse method. it's gentle on my very dry and sensitive skin, and since starting it ive noticed my cleansing has become much more effective! it's true that this product has a strong scent but it really isnt offensive to me, and it doesn't irritate my face either. i really recommend this one if youre new to the double cleanse method! I think it does remove waterproof make up too... I've tried with liquid lipstick and waterproof eyeshadow and it does remove them without problem I have gone through product after product that wouldn't irritate my skin and was affordable. Drug store products, I was done with. You get what you buy. LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS. This oil does not break me out and light it doesn make my skin feel tight and itchy! Thank you for this product!! This makes makeup melt off my face. I always use waterproof eye makeup and this works so well it honestly scares me a bit. OMG, you guys, this stuff is amazing.For reference, I have very oily skin, large pores with tons of sebaceous filaments (what people normally think are blackheads) all over my t zone, and use a prescription retinol.I have been using this stuff for about two weeks, and my skin has improved NOTICEABLY!  I use it at night, as the first part of my skin care routine.  I don't take any makeup off or anything, just put a tiny about (about half a pump) in my hands and rub it all over my face.  I concentrate on my t zone (clogged pore area) and the areas where I have a lot of makeup (eyes, cheeks).  I massage it in for about a minute then leave it on while I brush my teeth.  Then I cleanse with my normal cleanser and water.  Then I apply retin-a, oil, moisturizer.Since this is an oil cleanser, it is oil soluble and can actually break down all of the nasty gunk stuck in your pores that are oil/ chemical based like skin oil, sebum, makeup residue, sunscreen residue, etc.  This is the ONLY thing I have ever used that has made an actual different on my sebaceous filaments/ clogged pores.  I am so excited and in love with this product!!  Also, my skin is so much softer to the touch than it was before starting with this cleanser.  It has not made my face more oily... and I am maybe even a tiny but less oily, it's too close to call.I HIGHLY recommend you try this product ASAP.  In fact I just ordered more for my husband since hopefully he will finally wash his face daily with this since it's easier and requires less steps (don't need to wet your face first, etc).  I also love that I don't have to take off my makeup anymore with remover. I've ordered this 4 times now, I love it! Your eye makeup melts off with this oil, and your face is so soft when you are done. Put it on your dry face with dry hands and then wash your face with your cleanser like you normally do. I put it on as I'm getting in the shower and then wash my face off in the shower. I ordered 2 bottles last time, I use it every day. Love this product!  I'm fair skinned with freckles and wasn't used to the korean skincare routine.  When I first tried it I felt it was too oily and didn't leave me with a typical western clean skin feel.  However, I learned if you use this with water it lathers nicely.  You're still left with an oily feeling but I now appreciate this feel.  My skin is much healthy now, no longer dry, and looks more youthful.  I will purchase this again and recommend the product. This cleansing oil is light weight, gets rid of all my makeup (including waterproof mascara), has a pleasant soft scent, washes off easily, and doesn't break me out. I have slightly oily skin, and this stuff was great at removing all make-up, and didn't leave my skin oily. I follow up with a foam cleanser. This stuff easily took off my waterproof eye makeup, which I usually have to scrub at with eye makeup remover or makeup cleansing towelettes. I also wear contacts, and this did not burn/affect my eyes in any way. Great way to get all that makeup off! I love this stuff! It really washes off my makeup even my waterproof mascara and eyeliner. It also leaves my skin feeling clean and baby soft. I think it also helps keep my skin clear. Since I started using this, my skin is no longer as dry and has had less breakouts. It looks clearer and brighter too. I wish this product is available in every store. It's such an awesome product for my face! The product itself is wonderful! I unfortunately wear alot of makeup because of a birthmark and removing my makeup is a pain. I use this once (one pump) and smooth all over and makeup is almost all gone! Amazing! Its by far the best makeup remover Ive found, Ive tried many! The only reason I didnt like was the delivery time which took a little while but on a brighter note, received it way ahead of schedule, 2 weeks! Good for acne prone oily skin. Makeup removal is a dream very simple. I use with double cleanse method. I love this! It's the most extraordinary and best face wash I've ever use. It doesn't make my skin feel dry after I wash off the product! For its price, this stuff work well! :D I have pale, combination skin. Usually, my skin tone is really uneven and I'm prone to acne, so I was hesitant to try oil as a cleanser. However, after 4 days of usage, my skin tone is noticeably more even. My acne, though not gone, has somewhat cleared up as well! This product also leaves my skin super soft. This is a great product and I will definitely use again! I really love this cleanser! It smells nice and leaves your face feeling refreshed.  It also washes away all the impurities on your skin and can be used to wash makeup off as well.  It doesn't have an overly oil-ly feeling so it won't be like you're putting olive oil on your face.  I use the foam cleanser right after the oil cleanser and together they really leave my skin feeling brand new. Love this cleansing oil! I have very sensitive break out prone skin and so far have had no negative reactions. It removes all of my makeup easily and has a pleasant subtle scent. My only complaint is that it leaked a little during shipping.  Thankfully the other thing I bought with it was wrapped in plastic. This was my introduction to oil cleansing. I was surprised by how little sudsing there was, but I love how my face feels after it. Followed by the foaming cleanser, my skin feels refreshed, but not ... squeaky/over dried-clean, if you know what I mean. It feels soft and ready for the rest of the skincare! Gets rid of all of my stubborn eye makeup easily. I never expected an oil to be so great on my oily skin, but this is the perfect first step in my routine. I use twice daily, and my skin feels amazing after. It has even helped with recovering from hormonal acne. Will continue to buy this in the future.I follow this with Innisfree volcanic foam cleanser and then the rest of my Korean routine. This is the first oil cleanser I have used and I am thrilled.  It feels great to massage into skin and get the circulation going.  I have already reordered and plan making it part of my daily cleansing program.  Easy to add and the results are worth it.  Skin feels clean but not striped of moisture.  I highly recommend it for cleaning and increased circulation to skin. I use this cleansing oil as the first cleanse step in the Korean skincare ""model"" that I follow. This does a great job at preparing my skin for the second cleanse. It has not irritated my sensitive skin. I'm on my second bottle and plan to continue purchasing this cleanser. I have, for as long as I can remember, had a problem with clogged pores and blackheads on my nose.  This is the first product that has truly beaten them!  This is like photoshop in a bottle!  It will also take off any make up on earth and leave your skin feeling fresh, soft and clean. Absolutely love this product, i just applied one pump of it on my face after a heavy duty makeup used all day. It cleared up my skin like a charm. My skin was still soft and plump till the next day morning. I would highly recommend this to everyone. I am already obsessed with The Face Shop products, just wish they would ship to Australia more of their products. Love! It is a very nice lightweight cleansing oil. Gets rid of all of my makeup (except for waterproof mascara - can leave traces behind) and doesn't leave tooooo much of a film. Still does and it bothers me a little bit but I mean, it's an oil so of course it will. I am someone that loooooves that squeaky clean feeling so I always always always follow up with a cleansing foam but this works very well on its own as well! EXCELLENT PRODUCTS! GREAT PRICES AND FAST DELIVERY! WILL BUY AGAIN! The BEST product to get all of my makeup off. I use this before I cleanse my face to get the best clean possible. I think using an oil cleanser has changed my life with regards to my skin.  I can't say enough about it.  Within a week of using, my face has been so much nicer.  I'm using the double cleanse method with this as my first cleanser and cerave low ph cleanser as my second cleanser. From the very first use, this made my skin super smooth and soft the next day. I think it might have also even helped with my acne? I do advise to be careful with this around the eyes because I got this on my contact and thought I went blind for a minute:-) It was no big deal though, just had to flush out my eyes with water. I have combination skin, so I had my reservations when it comes to applying oils to my skin BUT I have been learning about Korean skincare and I must say I am loving IT!... This is a great product, it works perfectly well with my sensitive skin. You do need to use a cleaning foam after. Each bottle last for about 3 months .. and I do use it each night. works very well. the first time i used it i massaged my face for about two minutes, rinsed it off and my face had a nice glow. i've been using it for about two months now, every morning and night. my face has kepted the glow. it also takes off my makeup very good too. i only ever wear a bb cream, but even when i doll myself up it gets most of it and then my fase wash gets the rest. This is one of my favorite products of the face shop. This is my second time to buy this product. I use this everytime before i go to sleep part of my evening routine. It is light but definitely removes my makeup. Easyto remove/washout. And not expensive👍👍👍👍👌👌👌👌 I absolutely love the scent of this cleansing product! It is a bit oily but also watery and does a great job on removing my makeup. After rinsing off with lukewarm water my face seemed a bit brighter. The rice ingredient is working great. Will do an update after a week. :) Works on all makeup including waterproof mascara. I am in love with this product. It's the best cleanser I've ever used. It is kind of like an oil even though they call it a rice water cleanser. Best to finish off with a light soaping cleanser or a scrub and you have the K-Beauty double cleanse done! I really love this cleanser, already on my 2nd bottle since I first tried it! It is gentle, and is great at getting makeup off...plus affordable.  I like that it is not heavily fragranced.  My skin type is combination/oily, and this is great on my skin! I was originally hesitant about ordering this product, because some of the reviewers mentioned the smell. I absolutely love the smell! This product does exactly what it's supposed to. My make-up pretty much just melts off. No need for make up remover and it prevents my foaming cleanser from drying out my skin too much. I will definitely be ordering this again. I swear to God this cleansing oil probably took out makeup I had from a month ago. I had no make up on and I swiped it on my face and it picked up the slightest trace of make up. That's some deep oil work going on. It smells lovely! Just remember to follow up with a face wash after you're done. Hands down the best makeup remover. The oil isn't heavy at all, it glides nicely over the skin while melting heavy duty foundation and waterproof mascara. This is also a favorite of mine because it soothes my skin and doesn't break me out! Would definitely recommend and repurchase. Love this stuff! So soft and smells great - don't get it in your eyes! The only complaint I have is it doesn't 100% remove my eyeliner lolI usually have to use makeup remover then this for it to be completely removed but it is because I wear lots of eyelinerHowever... I love all products that use Rice as an ingredient!!! I love how it is soft on your skin and the feeling after you use this. I will purchase this again :) Bought this solely to take my makeup off because I felt like makeup wipes were too abrasive and these worked way better than any makeup wipes I've ever used. Took off all of my makeup (barely any residue when I wiped my face with toner) and cleansed my faced real well, but it was still really gentle which is good if you have sensitive skin. I recommend this for all skin types"
B00G5MRN84," love This product is very good foe my skin. I interduced to my friends too. I've been using it for more than a week now.  I'm following the direction to use it twice a week and followed with the Nuskin ph Balance Mattefying toner.  I can see the difference on my skin texture.  I love the result. I hesitated purchasing but before I made my decision asked questions here. They were pretty helpful answers.Great feeling after using and won't dry out. I could use it twice a week. I love this exfoliating face wash. It does a great job and leaves my face feeling clean and soft. I alternate days using with a non-exfoliating face wash. Smells fresh, works great! Very smooth non-irritating beads. I had always used Clinique but this product is by far much better. I love it!! it's very good.Get smoother, clearer and fresher skin with this deep pore scrub.best face scrub.all great products. It's a good product. After you washed your face with this facial scrub makes you feel your skin so clean and shiny. Love this product---it really does exfoliate my facial skin! Love the deep cleaning qualities! The new packaging through me for a loop---when I first used and sold this product it was in plastic jar. Good product to clean and scrub my face twice a week. This stuff works great!! Will definitely continue to purchase. Good product Used this product for years and I love it .Sue love it Love it Awesome product I love it an the other products I use by Nu Skin. Would you give me a list of the sales people here in Tenn. Good Satisfied! Nice item Good as usual. good Loved it! Thanks! thanks!

B0777PT149, Both my girlfriend and I have used this and our faces feel great after using it! Love that it has vitamin C in it! Awesome face wash
B076JKLG1H," My wife Loves this face wash! great product! Very soothing. Great product Great! The oil leaves your face feeling smooth and moisturized. Loved the softness of my skin after. Over age 40 i needed this! great product works well Excellent cleansing oil! Highly recommend! I am glad I found this product- it works like a charm!  I have heard of cleansing with oil, but I have oily skin and was terrified of adding more oil to it. When my skin recently started to freak out, I knew it had to do with overproduction of oil ( my longtime cleanser Proactiv wasn’t working anymore) I knew I had to find a ""once and for all"" solution. I have been using this oil to cleanse for the past few days, and OMG! My face is so smooth and is clearing up so well. I ordered the bigger bottle the day after I got the sample! Like it a lot. Very gentle and skin is soft. I really love this cleansing oil. It removes all of my makeup gently and easily, and I appreciate that it's a natural product. This product is a skin saver! I moved to a colder climate and my skin was drying out (on the face that is horrible because the skin needs oils to heal properly). I found this product and used it and instantly feel in love! Nothing was seeming to make my skin look smooth until I started using this cleansing oil. I am in my 40’s and skin doesn’t bounce back like it use to, but with this cleaning oil you will notice more youthful skin! This oil is great. I took it to India with me and used it for a couple of weeks, while traveling. The oil traveled well, to my surprise....didn't leak in my bag at all. It removed all of my makeup and kept my skin moisturized in very drying conditions and through weather extremes. I still prefer to wash my face with facewash and my Clarisonic most days, but I enjoy having this oil on hand when I'm on the go. The oil is also lightweight and there's just a slight trace of it (in a good way!) after rinsing my skin. This is a great product. Not only is it organic, but its easy to remove after you clean off your makeup. Other products I've used tend to get in my eyes and are SO thick I have the vision of a 90 year old woman with cataracts while I try to rinse my eyeballs off. Not fun.THIS product is thinner and removes makeup easily without the impaired vision. Plus, it leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. Will buy again! I don’t wear makeup so this doesn’t help me in that aspect. What it does help with is keeping my face moisturized. New York winters can be harsh on anyone’s skin and the cold air dries out my face a lot, so I use it when I’m heading outside or after a long day of being outside and it really feels as though My face is a lot softer and way less dry. This stuff is just what my dried up winter skin needed. You rub it on your dry, makeuped face and massage, then add water to make it creamy and rinse it off. It truly seems to grab all the makeup off my face (when I tested with a micellar cleanser, nothing was left!) and leaves my face nicely moisturized. Perfect for the end of the day. Also, I was in the midst of a terrible breakout when I started using it (probably due to my skin being so dehydrated) and not only have I gotten no new blemishes since, but the existing ones healed faster than normal and with less discoloration. I wasn't sure how I would like an oil cleanser, but was very pleased with the Organys Facial Cleansing Oil.  Massaging the oil onto my face felt soothing and my makeup desolved.  My face felt nourished.  I am glad I tried this product.  I think the Organys Oil makes my winter weathered skin feel better.  Thank you So far so good.  I have started using lipsense and shadowsense products and they are tough to get off sometimes.  This worked really well on getting the shadow off and did not dry out my eyes.  I have only used for two days, but was impressed with how well it removed my makeup. I have never used cleansing oil before but I am now a believer.  This oil works amazing!! Not only does it completely take off my foundation but also my eye makeup with little effort.  It leaves my skin soft and not dried out like most facial cleansers.  I highly recommend! Very happy with this facial cleanser.  After cleansing, I always use toner on a cotton ball to wipe away any residue remaining on my face.  With this product, there is none.  This leaves my face feeling clean and soft.  I have tried many cleansers, and really like this one. Works amazing on my combination skin, and super cheap. Cleans gently, but thoroughly, and gets all the excess make-up, oil, dirt, grime out of my pores. I love all of Organys’s products—they’re super effective and guilt-free. Highly recommend! I like using this on those dry days when I want a little extra help.  It feels good when rubbing it in on a dry face and then using a warm/hot wash cloth I've let run under the faucet for a while.  My own little mini-spa! I bought the sample size of this, and I love it! It does my face red when I put it on but the redness fades. The next morning my skin is so soft! It removes my sunscreen from my face when nothing else does. I love it! I love this cleanser! It seems to easily dissolve makeup gently and quickly. It left my skin feeling silky smooth. Definitely great for a nightly routine! All their products that I've tried so far have been great. A just wonderful cleansing oil. It removes my makeup with ease and leaves my skin feeling silky smooth. My skin has never felt so soft! It also feels very well hydrated. Great purchase that I will not be without. I was amazed with it ‘coz in just a few drops, it removed all my make up without sting. It’s so easy to use, no tissue or cotton balls needed. My face didn’t get oily after washing. Some make up removers give me pimples, but I never had with Organys. I brought it when I went on a vacation & let my relatives used it. They loved it too! Thanks Organys! Oil arrived very quickly, and I have been using it for a few days now.  So far, I am VERY happy.  The oil removes makeup (including mascara) easily, and leaves my skin feeling moisturized but not oily (I use a warm wet cloth to wipe off). Everything tends to break me out, but so far my skin hasn't had any issues, which surprised me.  Very pleased and I highly recommend trying this cleansing oil if you're on the fence. I have sensitive skin and removing makeup tends to aggravate my skin. I usually use Cerave cleanser and a makeup removing cloth...but have to rub and rub to remove makeup and irritate my skin. This oil works! I was pleasantly surprised. It melted the makeup off of my skin. I jump in the shower and rub it off with my makeup removing cloth and my skin is completely clean. I’m sold...I will keep buying. I really appreciate the $1 sample bottle to try it out...wish more companies did that. Senior skin that sometimes still breaks out and still has the oily Tzone areas yet the rest of the face is dry.  Very skeptical to use an oil to clean with, but it works wonderfully!  Just started using it but very happy with results. I've bought other items from Organys. Great customer service, very affordable, high quality products that deliver what they are advertised to do. Since ordering the Organys Gentle Facial Cleansing oil, my face is softer and smoother.  Glad i ordered it.  I like that it only takes a few drops each night.  Great product that will last a long time with great results. So I received this product as a sample, just to try, and am very pleased. I have very sensitive skin and this cleansing oil did not irritate my skin at all and that is something I always look for. I do have another makeup remover which I used before this but I have to use it over and over on my eyeliner so it can come off. With this cleansing oil, it came off first try and it took off the rest of my makeup as well. Also am happy I read the directions, the oil does have to be rinsed with water to ""emulsify"" it. I would recommend to anyone. I had never used a cleansing oil before because I was afraid it would leave my skin greasy. This oil cleans well and washes off completely with no residue. My skin feels soft. It is nonirritating to my sensitive skin, especially around the eyes. This is a really nice alternative to the soap I used to use. I love all their products I have the night cream the eye cream and now the cleansing oil I love how it leaves my skin feeling clean and looking great I highly recommend all their products I love this cleanser oil! Absolutely no breakouts or clogged pores after using it for 2 weeks.I will say, It has a slight pleasant fragrance which normally I don't like added in face oils because I just don't think oils need parfum/perfume. But once this face oil is on my face the scent goes away.I definitely recommend Organys! I've seen advertisements elsewhere for cleansing oil so was excited to try this one from a company I trust!It did not disappoint!!  Even so called mild cleansers can leave my 50+ skin feeling wrecked- this makes  it feel smooth and soft without an oily shiny residue :)  Love! Fabulous cleansing oil, one of the best that I have used.  The fragrance is very light but lovely.  The oil foams nicely, and cleans (and removes makeup) without drying.  A necessity in the cold winter.  This is my first purchase, but I will surely buy again! Great cleanser and an excellent product when used with their might cream. I am ver impressed with the products i have used from this company and this one is no exception. I love Organys Gentle Facial Cleansing Oil because it cleans makeup off washing my face only once. It leaves my skin moisturized which is a blessing due to the older I get the drier my complexion gets. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. So far I love the cleansing oil. It makes my skin very soft and hydrated. Much less drying than soap and no pimples from it! My skin appears refreshed since using! I received a trial size and fell In love. I have combination skin where some cleanser dry me all the way out. This is a perfect face wash. Plus the smell is amazing!! Lovely cleansing oil! Smells sort of like my favorite fruit: lychee! My face has a delightful glow after using and I will continue to invest in this product! I love this Cleansing oil! It leaves my skin soft for a long time. It is very gentle so if one needs to remove a heavy makeup, they need to apply the oil for couple of times. It is very safe to apply it even around the eyes. I would definitely recommend this product. Pleasant smell from the geranium, leaves my skin so soft and hydrated. Sometimes I forget to moisturize and I'm fine! Removes eye makeup too. Great stuff. I am so glad I tried this! I love it and will definitely buy again. Goes on smoothly and rinses off really well. No stickiness; just smoother cleaner skin. I bought the 1 oz sample to find out if I'm gonna like it. After one week of using this cleanser, I figured a way that work best for me is to dab the cleanser oil on my face, give it a good massage, splash my face with water and wipe the traces of the cleanser oil with cotton wipe. It removes all the excess make up and leaves your face with a soft dewy  appearance. I like it  :) excellent cleansing oil!!I have been using luxury cleansing oil for so many years, but this oil works best. IMPRESSED!!! I love the way this cleanse feels on my face.  Not only does it take my makeup off, it makes my skin feel supple and renewed. Very moisturizing. My face felt very good after using Organys facial oil cleanser. Other cleansers make my face feel tight and dry. Not Organys, tho!! And, I don't need to slather on layers of moisturizers anymore either. Just a little works fine in combination with this cleanser. I recommend this cleanser if you have dry skin. I love this oil! I have never been able to use oil on my face, but this one does the work. It cleanses and removes my makeup and I have had no side effects to my skin. I have also noticed that it makes my skin looks smooth and beautiful. I am very happy with this product and I will reorder again. Was looking for a new cleanser and read the great reviews about the Organys Gentle Facial Cleansing Oil. It is everything and lots more.....works the way it's supposed to and is very gentle. I rub it gently on my eyes before I shower, then I gently rub my eyes again with wet fingers and rise. It leaves some residue but this comes off when I wash my face with another cleanser and dry with a towel after my shower. I have used my sample a couple times. I am a frequent lap swimmer so in the winter my skin is often very dry and itchy from the chlorine. This oil feel great and doesn’t feel oily after you rince it off. I love the smell of this cleansing oil. It doesn't remove mascara completely. However, my skin feels clean and smooth after the wash. Great product....I went online and ordered the full size.Leaves my face so smooth and soft ! The cleansing oil seems to dissolve my make up. I love that. Does not leave my skin greasy, just soft. Love it. It’s my daily makeup remover for sure. It’s perfect for my skin, so easy to apply and it cleans my face completely. I was really impressed with this product . It takes the makeup off without any harshness and leaves my skin soft and not greasy. There is a pleasant but not overwhelming scent that is enjoyable Love the moisturizing effect this gives my face when I wash it.  It cleans the mascara very easily and leaves a great feeling on my face when use it. Also, it is not too heavy of an oil, it leaves a very slight sheen of a moisture on your face afterwards.  I have used very expensive cleansers and this is great. It only takes a small bit to clean off my makeup.  Try it, you will be very pleased. This cleansing oil works great for removing eye makeup!  And it's very gentle on my skin too. I like the product, smell very good, a lot of bubble and do leaves a sticky residue, fell very refreshing after use. Will definitely buy again. Gently removed makeup, even heavy mascara. I will probably buy again. Great customer service Love it! I've never been impressed with oil cleansers and had just been using olive oil, but tried this trial size and now I'm hooked <3 I love this company and their great products. Non irritating, leaves my skin clean, soft and moisturized! Got this sample and LOVE IT! Feels awesome on my skin and takes my make up right off!!! Never used oil before this and won’t go back now to regular face wash! Recently started using this product and, like the other things in this line, I’m sold! I really like this facial cleaning oil. I was using Vaseline before to remove my eye make-up and I would have to wipe continuously afterwards to remove it all. With this cleaner, I rub it gently in a circular motion, wipe with a cotton ball and rinse. I think I'll be replacing my Vaseline permanently. I tried a sample of this oil cleaner and this is now my favorite makeup remover. It doesn't irritate your eyes like most makeup removers do. Now that's winter and my skin is getting more dry, this product made my skin feel significantly softer and moisturized. I've used another Organys product and loved it as well, so this is becoming my favorite brand. I'd highly recommend it! Smells great, works as a facial massage oil as well! Very silky and smooth skin after! It smells nice and my face feels clean and smooth after using it. I recommend trying it I like this product because it dissolves oil-based make-up better than any gel cleanser can and leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft. I have oily skin, but I use a retinoid serum at night, so I need a cleanser that will not strip my face of its natural oils, and this product is perfect for that purpose. Wonderful product. The main reason I bought was for make-up removal for my very dry skin. This oil makes my skin feels like a baby. Infused with baby oil and vitamin; this is the best formula fore removing make up - especially eye make up. PERFECT for dry skin. I have only used the product for a few days but it’s remarkable at removing make up and seems to be really helping my dry winter skin.  I will definitely continue to use the product. I really like the way my skin feels after cleansing with this oil.  It removes makeup and leaves my face feeling clean and moisturized. I received a small sample bottle after my purchase of the lash serum. I found it light and pleasantly scented, and gentle on my sensitive and unpredictable skin. I used a cotton wool pad dampened with toner after cleansing with the oil and only a very tiny amount of makeup was left so it did a good job cleaning my skin. Did a good and gentle job with eye make up too! Would use again. I love this facial cleansing oil - it gets my skin really clean and makes it feel so soft afterward. I really appreciate being able to try this product out at such an affordable price, and with free shipping to boot.  I will keep using it!  Many thanks! Organys gentle facial cleansing oil left my face feeling soft and refreshed.  I've had problems with cleansers in the past that made my skin feel dry or left a sticky residue.  I didn't have any of those problems with this product.  After I washed the oil off with water, my skin felt clean and smooth.  I noticed a positive change in the quality of my skin after only a few uses. I live in Minnesota and my skin gets very dry in the winter time. I had never used a cleansing oil but am impressed with this oil and how it dissolves/cleans up the makeup on my face without drying my skin. I recently brought it with me on my trip overseas. It worked great as I could use it as is and not have to pack extra cotton pads to remove my makeup. I highly recommend it! This is great.  I used it the first night to remove full face makeup and it did the trick.  Easy to apply, works quickly and comes off just as easy.  This is a good product and everything I seem to get from the company is quality.  !!! My face has been breaking out for the last month and I don’t know the cause.  I got a free sample of the cleansing oil and gave it a try. It has been 2 days using this at night to remove makeup and my face is almost cleared up. I will continue to use this product and I highly recommend it. I really like the way it works ; so light waiting and smooth on my skin. Fills fresh and cool Love this product!  Cleans and moisturizes without feeling greasy!!! I have combination oily/dry skin and I'm extremely sensitive/acne prone. I was very hesitant to use this but much to my surprise it's great! My skin feels moisturized in all the right places. I have not had any adverse reactions, and hope that with continued use I will keep seeing good results! Thank you so much Love this! As someone with oily, acne-prone skin, I was hesitant to try an oil cleanser. However, it makes sense that water does now mix best with (face) oil, so I gave this a try. It instantly makes my skin smoother and hydrated, and takes off my makeup in only a minute or two. Looking forward to continued effects and results! I have oily, sensitive skin and usually avoid cleansing oils because they leave a geasy, shiny look and cause acne.  However, this product was great.  It left my skin feeling soft, but not greasy and it did not make the skin break out even on warm days.  It also had a subtle, nice scent.  I will continue to use this product. very smooth to put on, cleanse the pores effectively I have been using Organys Gentle Facial Cleansing Oil for about 3 days. Already I like it very much. Not only does is leave my face clean and removes all make-up, but it also leaves my face soft and not feeling tight. I feel I can go without using a moisturizer. Which i don't of course. Wife used it to remove  some oil-based costume makeup. She said the oil was fabulous in removing the heavy makeup without much rubbing. I had doubts when I saw this was an oil cleanser, but I wanted to give it a try. My face has never looked better!! It has dissolved the blackheads and shrunk the pores on my nose and cheek area significantly. The scent is so light and refreshing. Give this a try if you also have doubts, you will be amazed!! I love the way the Organys Cleansing oil leaves my face feeling soft, moisturized, clean, and youthful. Works great removing waterproof mascara. Love love love this new product!!! very nice pre-cleansing oil. It is not greasy and emulsifies with water! I'm so surprised how much I love this product. I love how soft and moisturized my skin feels after I was it.I was a little suspect about how well an oil would really clean and take off my make-up. This cleansing oilreally removes my foundation, my mascara and my eye pencil. I really blown away. I love it! Works well Very gentle and effectively removes all makeup including water proof mascara. I love this cleanser! I have never used an oil based cleanser before.  I have dry skin and it cleanly removes makeup. Further, it doesn’t leave my skin greasy or oily. It nicely moisturizes my skin. And, it has a nice light clean fragrance. I received a free sample of this oil and I have been using it now for over a week and I love it.  Will be buying this as part of my skincare regime. The application was simple.  It's somewhat oily but I guess that's the point.  It removes cream and makeup well.  It worksAgain, the only drawback was the oily feeling.  But using a wipe afterward, it was fine.  I recommend it! I normally use coconut oil to remove my makeup. I was not expecting to love this product so much, but it far exceeded my expectations. It smells great, removes dirt oil and waterproof makeup, and washes off with just water; no need to use additional soap to get off the cleansing oil. Love this stuff!! I love the feel of this oil! It's gentle on my eyelashes and doesn't leave my skin oily. I wish it turned a little milkier when you wash it away just to have a clearer idea of where else you have to make sure to wash it away from, but I plan on buying this for the foreseeable future! EXcellent Love the face cleaner, leaves my skin soft and refreshed! Love it. Not too oily. Good product. The delivery was really quick. It's very gentle and the size is perfect for travel. I was super skeptical to try this, as I've always struggled with an oily face, but I was pleasantly surprised! This oils removes all dirt and makeup from my face, and leaves my skin super soft and moisturized. I use this product at night only, and so far it's been amazing! I cant wait to gift my mom some Left my skin moisturized and soft - perfect for the upcoming winter season! I tried the 1 oz version of this product and am very please with the results. I was worried that it would have an oily residue. but it does not. It removes make-up well and leaves my skin feeling soft. I will definitely purchase again. I have been using this product for over a week now-love it! Leaves my skin soft and clean.I do use warm water and a face cloth- bumpy area on my chin that I assumed needed a drying  treatment is now feeling much smoother! Thank you! Works amazing on my combination skin.  Cleans gently, but thoroughly, and gets all the excess make-up, oil, dirt, grime out of my pores. I love all of Organys’s products—they’re super effective and guilt-free. Highly recommend and love the smell! I ordered a sample size for a $1 and I’m glad I did. I really liked it. The smell is nice. It didn’t take off all of the mascara but mascara in general is difficult to take off. I loved how my skin felt after I rinsed my face. It was really soft. This stuff makes my face feel so soft and smooth. It’s very different than regular face wash. My skin feels moist and dewy when I’m done rinsing it off, I like feeling dry as with other soaps. I just got two other Organys products today so I’m excited to try them all together! Very soft on the skin and great conditioning for my lashes. Cleans very well. I struggle with dry skin so regular cleaners are too harsh on my skin. This product takes all the makeup off my skin while hydrating it at the same time. I have used the sample, and I think it's great. The skin feels soft. I will continue using it. Mild scented.. It is an oil based facial cleanse (which I normally dislike); however, this oil makes my face feel extremely smooth and helps rejuvenate it. I live in Fairbanks, AK which is an incredibly cold, dry climate and the oil helps moisturize it. This cleansing oil is great. Now that it's get cooler out it's keeping a healthy balance of oils on my skin. It is a light clean feeling after using. I love how gentle this product is. Love this product.  Really removes make-up and leaves my super soft and adequately mosturized.  Have bought several other Organys Skin Care Products and love them all.  The cleansing oil will definitely remain in my skin care regimen I loved it!! I have never heard of using an oil for cleansing your face but OMG. My face feels so much smoother and looks so much better. One thing that I noticed most of all is my is not flaky around my nose and lips after I use it. Wow. What a nice way to clean your face - gentle, nice scent, effective. I don't wear a lot of make up, so I can't speak to how well it would remove lots of layers. I just like the simplicity and soft skin afterward. So far I like it, have only used it a few times, but the oil is nice with the colder months and seems to leave skin refreshed.  I was afrraid the oil would clog pores but does not, seems to gently clean skin and leave it renewed. This is my first experience with an oil cleanser. It worked really well in taking off heavy makeup. It does leave your face feeling oily but I usually feel dry after cleansing so it was nice to not have to moisturize after use. I've been wanting to try a cleaning oil and I came across this one. I love how it works to dissolve any makeup I'm wearing (other than my eye makeup), it retains the moisture on my skin, and it smells so good (like lychees)! Definitely try it for yourself! I have never found a cleanser and makeup remover that is so cleansing yet so gentle. My face is removed off all makeup and isn’t left feeling dry and weak. This will definitely be apart of my daily products. I've tried the oil and feel good my face, more smooth and bright. Maybe I don't need to wash my face with water but use this clean oil to dry clean when I travel. Using this product for about a month and the hydration in this cleansing oil provides is remarkable without causing breakouts.  I have very dry skin so this is a lifesaver in cold dry climates.  My skin is so much softer and hydrated! This cleansing oil makes my skin feel so incredibly soft after! It's not the most conventional way of washing your face, but you really feel the oil working to get all the dirt off. My skin looks so nice the next day! This oil leaves my face feeling  smooth and fresh. I love it there is no fragrance and is natural. I’ve not used an oil cleanser previously, but it may be my new fave.  Felt fresh and clean, plus seemed like softer skin after wiping with a damp cloth. Smells nice and washes pretty clean with water! Very nice! Just started using for couple days. First impression is how it smells. Gently fragrant.Also, my skin feels very soft and hydrated after using it.Plus, can’t beat that price for 1 oz bottle. Skin feels so soft after using Thank you for this wonderful product, I highly recommend! Great product and makes your face feel so moisturized after cleansing. I would definitely buy this product again. No greasy residue afterwards. Leaves your face smooth and soft like a babies face. Wiill contunue to use this as a great face cleanser. I have really dry skin so I'm always nervous about trying out new products. But, this was worth it. The cleanser leaves my skin soft, smooth, and moisturized! Works great at removing make up and leaves skin fresh! I love it! Love this! Works great I used it the same day it arrived. It worked perfectly removing all my makeup, and besides that, it left my skin feeling really soft, even at the next day when I woke up. Totally recommend​ it. Very happy with this product! This product really works, very moisturizing to your skin, cleans makeup off completely and makes your skin very soft and glowing afterwards. Didn’t need to apply moisture afterwards but I did to have an SPF protection. I absolutely love this face wash! It’s perfect for the cold winter months when my skin gets really dry and flaky. This facial oil immediately transforms my skin to a more hydrated and radiant complexion. Love the feel of this after washing makeup off.

Feels clean. Great cleansing oil Love this product! very good product Good Product... Decent product Really good Works well Great cleansing oil. Removes makeup like nothing else. Skin is soft and hydrated after using it. I wipe my face with a wet towel after cleansing with this oil and it feels great. You can use a foam cleanser afterwords, but it is not necessary. As an actress, clear skin is very important to my work, but I've always struggled with it and have tried a hundred different products to remove make up and cleanse my face. This is the first one that makes my skin really feel soft and blemish free even when I have to spend all day on set wearing heavy camera make up! I was skeptical to try a cleansing oil because I wasn't sure how clean my face would feel afterwards, BUT was I ever wrong! It takes my makeup off beautifully and leaves my skin feeling super soft. Great for the harsh winter as my face gets very dry. I love this product and have recommended this to my mom and sister! Winter is here (at least where I live) and as usual, I started developing dry patches as the weather got cooler, no matter how much and how many times I moisturize my skin during the day.  I already have dry skin as it is and the harsh weather never helps. I use all natural skin care and I have a go-to gentle cleanser for my sensitive dry skin that I really like but no matter how gentle, natural and nourishing it is, it still leaves my skin feeling very stiff and dry after I wash it during this time of the year.Trying this oil cleanser completely changed my skin. It smells so good (like roses) it is one of my favorite scents for skin care. Dry patches are very uncomfortable and unflattering. I noticed I huge change after I used this for the first time. I like that I get to massage my skin for a few minutes before washing it. It feels really relaxing and it gets off all my make up and impurities after a long day. Make sure you activate the oil with a little bit of water after massaging the oil in, work it in a bit more and rinse it with Luke warm water.My skin feels so moisturized and the best is: IT STAYS MOISTURIZED ALL DAY LONG until it’s time to wash it again. My dry patches went away and my skin feels as soft as a baby’s bum.I love love love this oil cleanser. I will continue to use it and I recommend it to everyone with sensitively dry skin. I have combination skin prone to breakouts and now starting to show signs of aging.  After turning 40 I've been making the rounds through the luxury brands for skin care but the Organys was an unexpected and wonderful surprise! This cleanser melts my full coverage foundation and long wear mascara completely off yet leaves my skin soft and conditioned. I love the age fighting aspect of the geranium oil but the light scent it leaves after rinsing is also feminine & pleasing. I am currently using their night cream and their day cream and I love both so I thought I would try the sample size of their cleansing oil and I LOVE it.  Their line of products are really amazing.  I was afraid that since it is an ""oil"", it was going to leave my skin feeling and looking oily afterwards, but it didn't at all.  I am one that gives honest opinions on here, I've even had a few of my reviews removed for being too honest, lol.  I I have oily skin and I thought I would try this because it says that it doesn't matter what type of skin you have.  I have to admit that I was skeptical at first, but I have really liked the cleansing oil.  I'll update the status after using for at least a month.  :-) This oil leaves my skin feeling incredibly smooth and fresh! Judging from the cloth I use to wipe away the oil, it truly does do an excellent job of cleaning, too. I would especially recommend using Organys Cleansing Oil as the weather gets cooler and the air is dryer. Our skin needs all the help it can get! Silky smooth is the best description of how this feels on your skin.  I use it nightly to remove eye makeup, in a quick wipe on/wipe off.  Sometimes I use warm water to rinse off, sometimes I just wipe it off with a tissue.  Either way, your skin will feel silky smooth, and makeup free.  My skin is usually very sensitive and reactive to most creams I try.  This feels natural and non-irritant.  Try it, you'll like it.  :) I was skeptical that oil could leave your face clean, but for a dollar I thought it was worth a try, and I like other Organys products.  I was very pleasantly surprised!  It left my face clean and moisturized, but not at all oily and I need less moisturizer.  I'm 55 and my face tends to get dry in the colder months. This is my first time to use a facial cleansing oil, and I have to say, I’m pleasantly surprised and very pleased with this product. I have oily and acne prone skin, so I’m very cautious about products that I use. Organys left my skin soft and clear. It didn’t leave any residue, nor did it feel like it stripped my skin. I only poured a small amount and it was enough to cover my face and neck. will do another review after two weeks of continuous use, but for now it’s a 5 star. I have sensitive and combine skin. Prefer skincare products are natural and not greasy .  This cleansing oil is amazing. My face feel clean and soft after using. And even the blackhead are less than before. Compare with the cleansing oil I used before,  I definitely stick with this one. I absolutely love this cleanser for my face!! The product leaves my face feeling so very soft and moist yet super clean!! I've tried many mild cleaners so that my face doesnt feel dry and tight, but nothing has left my skin feeling so soft.  Thank you for this wonderful product, I highly recommend! I really like this Organys cleanser. Your skin feels so clean, but also soft and moisturized. I have been using this  for a couple of weeks, and my coworkers have noticed my skin looks really good and have asked what I've been doing! I have dry skin prone to black heads. Since I started using Organys cleansing oil, my skin has never looked better! I tried a few brands before finding this! I really love this brand! This oil is thick and cleans deep, rinses very clean and leaves my face super soft. When you start cleaning with oil there is no way you will ever use soap again This is an amazing cleanser. I never would have thought an oil cleanser could be so effective or actually lather, but this one does. I was having issues with dry, flakey patches on my face that would not go away with conventional moisturizers. After two weeks of morning and evening cleansing, the patches are gone. I liked how gentle the cleanser was and how it didn't clog my pores. It also grabbed any old makeup too. So glad I found this product I thought Organy's eye lash serum was great but I love the Facial Cleansing Oil!  It leaves my skin clean but very moist and hydrated.  I am a golfer and exposed to wind and sun so this is a super way to start my day and before bed time. Very good natural product. The smell is pleasant, and my skin is soft and clean after using it. I love it. I had reservations about this product, thought it would leave my skin feeling greasy, but it doesn't.  It leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.  I would definitely recommend this product When I first use this oil, it instantly removed my makeup asks left my skin feeling clean and refreshed. I would definitely recommend buying this product. Really great make up remover! Even gets hard to come off mascaras and eye liner! Excellent facial cleaner, removes makeup easily, gets your skin pretty and smooth! Super like! Such a generous size. It leaves my skin silky soft and it has a nice scent. I use it to clean my face and it does a good job. I love the consistency of this oil! Leaves my skin super clean and smooth! My skin does not look oily! I recommend this product! Smells amazing... keeps my face moisturized and glowing all day ... amazing product! I really like this product. It nourished my dry skin. Very hydrating cleanser - 😍 Really great product!"
B002CIXVVI," My daughter loves this cleanser. It is helped clear up her acne dramatically. My 16-year old has been using all 4 products for about a year!  We had tried everything available with no results.  Within 2 weeks, with Exposed, her face to clear up.  It is almost perfect now!.  Thank you so much for providing us with such an amazing product!! I have tried nearly everything to combat my adult breakouts and NOTHING has ever worked short or long term.  And then one day I decided to give EXPOSED a try and it has made a world of difference.  Exposed is the ONE & ONLY cleanser, toner and acne/clear pore topical that has ever truly worked.It's so amazing that I no longer shy away from having my picture taken and my confidence has raised considerably! Love this cleanser, helps with my acne but does not over-dry my skin. When she's using it consistantly, it works great and fast.  She's 15 years old and admits to being lazy and not washing her face in the morning and night, but see's the effect when she uses it the way it's supposed to and has started being more consistant. This cleanser does not irritate my skin and it feels so smooth. My skin has improved but this is used in combination with other products. Satisfied The Facial Cleanser from Exposed is one of the best face washes I have used, from drugstore Clearasil to prescription grade Obagi Acne products, Exposed surpasses the rest. It is soft, potent, lathers well, and smells good. It doesn't sting, itch, or create a harsh cooling sensation. It contains Salicylic acid which is a standard acne fighting synthetic used by many companies, but it also has all natural sage extracts and Pro-vitamin B5. I use the Cleanser twice in the morning and twice at night. To say the least my skin has been looking pretty flawless the past several months. One of the best on the market today, and a great price. Great product!!  I ordered another product (clearing tonic), online, in this product range, but it appears I purchased direct from the producer - oops!! Amazon prices are more competitive i love this face wash!!! i never have BAD acne but i would break-outs at times due to my menstrual cycle and im sure other random things like... stress or make-up. This has helped a lot and the price is right... proactive is NO GOOD!! This is that only thing that's worked My teenage daughter had bad acne until I purchased exposed facial cleanser. She uses this everyday once in the morning and once at night. It doesn't dry up your skin like some acne products. She has been using this product for more than a year and it is worth it. Works like a charm. Great product. This cleanser zapped the zits better than proactive..is more natural and more expensive but if proactive is not for you than definately try this I received my order earlier than expected and I was very impressed by the quality of the packaging. Also, everything about the product speaks to its superior quality and the dedication of the company. But most of all, I was impressed by the customer service and will definitely by purchasing from Exposed Skin Care again. I love this product!!! I've tried everything under the sun to clear this horrible ance. Within about a week, I started to see improvement; and now about a month in, almost all the little bumps I had are gone! I definitely recommend this product!!!! What do you have to lose? besides bad skin!! Have never left a review but this face wash is AMAZING for breakouts! Definitely recommend This cleanser has exceeded my expectations! I literally have no more acne after only 3 weeks of using it. best face product yet. removes black heads, and pimples. face was closer within two weeks! Finally found something that cleans without drying out my skin.  Has helped immensely with my moderate adult acne.  Love this stuff and also the Pore Clearing Gel.  Love, love, love it! This is the best and only face soap that works. It keeps my skin clear and looking fresh even after a long day at work. I love this, buy it, use it and never look back to those stupid kits at walmart which fail to do anything except waste my money. Wish it came in a bigger bottle Great product and lightening speed shipping! This is only cleanser that EVER cleared my skin completely, worth every penny!!!!! Works great to clear up skin problems If you want a cleanser that is gentle on your skin AND assists in clearing up acne, this is the product you've been looking for I love it :) I have bought this several times for my son, he says it is a great shower face wash and helps control the oil. Great stuff definitely works Wonderful product.  Perfect for sensitive skin (which I have) and excellent for combatting breakouts.  Very highly recommended. Best. Acne. Prone. Cleanser. Use this and ONLY this twice a day in the shower, and you WILL see results in 2 weeks or less The only face wash I have found that has kept my skin clear & healthy. I have purchased  face wash products up to $250 that don't come close to doing the job compared to this reasonably priced product(and it's cruelty free)! It works! I have acne on my face for 4 years. After I use it for two or three days, it improves Great product!!!  Seeing results after 2 weeks!!! seems to work when my son actually puts it on his face THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR YOUR FACE.YOUR SKIN WILL FEEL ALOT SMOOTHER IN LIKE 4 DAYS AND IT WILL CLEAR UP IN 9 DAYS. BUT I WAS ALSO USING THE ACNE TREATMENT SERUM. I AM 14 YEARS OLD. clean I have had adult acne for 30 years. I have tried multiple daily cleansers, etc. The EXPOSED makes my face feel SO CLEAN and my face doesn't get near as oily either. Reasonably priced as well! Love it! Will recommend it to others! Works like charm Great cleanser! I've ordered a few times from Exposed and regardless of whether I buy the full line or just a couple of items, they always come faster than expected and in the full box packaging for quality. I've had skin troubles since my teenage years and changing skin types that varied from extremely sensitive, dry, oily, etc. This product is the only one I trust to regain my skin's consistency, keep it from breaking out, and quickly heal blemishes and balance redness. Everyone's skin is different, but this product definitely works for me. I started with a couple of full sets, and now only need the cleanser and acne serum. Definitely recommend, especially for the price!! What a find !!!! This is the only thing that has help with my daughters acne...do not bother with the ""other"" stuff.... very gentle on the skin and it really does work, pimples will vanish. I love this product. its the only product out there that actually works. Best cleanser by far. I have had acne that was hard to get rid of and this got rid of it. I have used proactive and it dose not compare. Very refreshing, clean, and smells healthy. I have been using EXPOSED products for over 4 months now and I love it so much. I've been using Exposed for almost a year now and I have to say my face looks amazing. I switched from Proactive due to allergic reactions and I have not move since. You know when using a product and it stops working after a certain time, well Exposed Skin continues to work and i would have maybe 1 or 2 bumps pop up two to three months at a time. Other than that my face is cleared. Also my complexion is brighter and you hardly see any of the blemishes i had before. Im crazy about this product and hope it doesnt fail! I am a 56 year old business woman who has fought acne and stress picking all my life.  Once I started picking at my acne,it just started a downward spiral...pick at one and you have two more the next day.....miserable.  I always wished that something would clear up all my acne so I wouldn't have anything to pick on.  I have tried everything!  I came upon Exposed cleanser while searching for the best acne treatments online and FINALLY found THE perfect acne product after 40+ years of acne.  It all cleared up within 1 month and has been clear ever since.  I have been using this product for 3 months and will not use anything else.  IT WORKS!! The facial cleanser keeps my skin looking healthy and removes makeup easily. I also appreciate the fact that this product contains no fragrance that might irritate my sensitive skin. I have been using this product for three months and have noticed a significant improvement with skin tone and control over break-outs. I highly recommend the facial cleanser to those individuals looking for a product that is gentle yet effective. I bought this as a replacement to the cleanser that came with the set of face cleanser, tonic, pore clearing serum, and acne treatment. Since I started using the Exposed Skin Care line, my cystic acne has cleared up. For months I had been trying different options, I even put diluted bleach on my skin at one point. I began using these products and my skin has vastly improved. I still have trouble areas, but it's a vast improvement! The troubled areas are stubborn because I have to wear makeup, if I didn't I know my skin would be so much clearer...because of these products! This face wash is the only acne product that has consistently worked for my daughter. Other products work for a while, but the acne returns after a few months. She has used Exposed skin care for over a year, and it's still going strong! I have had acne for really long time and I have tried many many products, such as clean clear, h2o, proactive, etc, but none of them worked for me. Not until I tried exposed skin care, my face is still quite out of control, very oily and have huge breakouts from time to time. This product definitely saved my face! Facial Cleanser from Exposed is one of the best cleanser i've tried, it is not strong or aggressive to your face specially if you have sensitive skin, i like it because cleans your skin from acne very very fast, in about 3 or 4 days i feel the difference. Have been using this cleanser for many months and it is really great! Ive always had sensitive skin and this does the trick without being harsh. Its also such a good price compared to the other stuff. My skin has stayed relatively clear and I'm able to make one bottle stretch for quite a while. If you're thinking about giving this a try I would definitely recommend it! After taking my daughter to a year and half of dermatologist appointments with no improvement with antibiotics, facial prescribed cleansers, ect plus using Pro Active and over the counter products with no progress this Exposed brand worked!!! I wish I had ordered it sooner for my teenager. We did not want to go on Acutane and or birth control pills for a young teenager as suggested by doctor once all was tried. Complexion is beautiful and almost flawless once Exposed was used daily. We do however have to keep it ordered. She did run out of it for about a week and had breakouts so we quickly learned to keep it ordered and not to run out of it. I'm thankful for this product. Could have saved a lot of money by buying this first. Been using religiously for almost a year. My skin has done a complete 360. It’s the smoothest and most even toned I’ve ever had it. Yes I have flare ups around my time of the month but that’s really it. I’ve used everything from drug store, to medical prescription. This is the only thing I’ve seen real results with. If you suffer with moderate acne just get the cleanser. If you have terrible acne like myself, try the whole kit. Worth the $$!! I have never left a product review but I felt as though it was necessary because of this product.  This product has changed my life.  I was having a lot of issues with my skin over the past two months, especially on my chin.  After I started using this product I saw results within the first week.  I have constantly been using it for about a month now and my skin has never been so clear in my entire life.  I love this product and would recommend it to anyone and everyone!!!! I was had very bad breakouts for long time even I tried so many different acne products before I start to use Exposed. At beginning I bought the kit and I found something that works beyond amazing. Now my entire face is clean and looks healthy. I only use this cleanser and the tone for most time now, it is unlike others, it doesn't dry out my skin. I would strongly recommend this cleanser to those who don't like spent too much time on it. It definitely works. Thanks Exposed!Facial Cleanser This review is for all those thousands of other women out there who have experienced the same frustrations.  I am 47 years old, and I never had skin problems until I got into my mid-40s. Suddenly, I began getting embarrassing, painful acne along my cheeks and jawlines. I tried everything, from dermatologist-prescribed medications to expensive products sold on those infomercials.  I tried it all and wasted so much money, as nothing worked.  My skin is very sensitive to just about everything -- oils, alcohols, fragrances.  Nothing cleared up my skin.  My biggest problem was this--all those products out there that are designed to clear acne -- they are too harsh on my nearly 50-year-old skin!  They turn my skin to leather.  I used to use ProActiv even, but it was too rough on my skin.  I came across the Exposed Skincare line, and I can't tell you enough just how wonderful it is.  It not only cleared up my skin right away, but it leaves my skin so soft and smooth.  I've found nothing like it EVER ,and I have tried every single thing out there.  What I like most is this -- so many product lines instruct you to use their product for a month before you see positive results, claiming that you have to give the products time to remove all those toxins from your skin.  They warn that your skin will get worse before it gets better!  I have found this to be so annoying, because I don't want to give a product a month to get results, because I never know if the product is truly pulling out the toxins from my skin or if I'm having a reaction to it.  Even more frustrating is when you give a product a month to work, and it doesn't, and then you can't even return it because you have passed the 30-day guarantee period!  The shocking thing with Exposed Skincare is that I found that it worked right away.  Within days, it began to clear up my skin, and again, it leaves your skin so soft and smooth.  I only wish that the company would sell the product in much larger bottles; other than this, I strongly urge any woman in their mid-40s who are suffering with bad skin to give this a try. BETTER THAN PROACTIV! I stopped using proactiv because it was too harsh on my face. I use this now and it's so soft going on and it makes your face feel very soft. The bottle is pretty small but a small amount spreads pretty well. Two people can use one bottle for two months. I recommend using a lotion with salicylic acid, avoid benzoyl peroxide in my opinion. Also, new drug is being developed by BioPharmx that looks very promising. This product is great I tried all sorts of facial washes and this by far has helped me with my acne! I am 29 and I still get some adult acne! It's gentle on my skin and never leaves it dry. I've been using this product for about 5 years now Those of you saying this face wash doesn't work would be right in some sense. You have to use it with the other products Exposed offers to be 100% effective. But once you do, it'll eliminate current acne and prevent future breakouts. I've been using it forever now and my skin is almost perfect. My acne scars are even lighter than they used to be.Also, don't use this to wash makeup off. That's not its purpose. I started using Exposed after I turned 30 and my skin started to change on me.  I started to have cystic acne on my chin coinciding with my cycle and it was awful!  After some research, I found Exposed and decided to try that over Proactive.  My skin looks great!  I do the whole system - cleanser, toner, acne treatment serum, moisturizer (daytime) and then cleanser, clear pore, moisturizer (nighttime).  It lasts a long time.  Sometimes Amazon has better pricing/shipping times, so I'll get it here.  And sometimes I just buy directly from Exposed. My son swears by this stuff. I never had acne in my life until I had my hysterectomy and my face got covered in it. I  used proactive and it made it worse then I found this product and I now have clearer skin and my skin feels so good. If you  have acne this is the product for you. I just received this product five days ago and can say that when I used for the first time and since then, I've noticed a feeling of really clean and refreshed skin.  The product describes that it can dry your skin a bit but I haven't noticed that at all. I just feel like the entire surface of my face has been thoroughly but gently cleansed. There's no heaviness due to moisturizers.  It feels as though it's a deeper cleaning.  Very satisfied and highly recommend. I have tried many different face washes, most being the different brands available at retail stores, but never found anything that worked. I then took a chance on a product called ""Acnetix"" which was supposed to be an all-in-one acne face wash. Acnetix left my face pretty oily and was never successful in clearing up my acne. After a few months of using that product, I was reading reviews online and it was a toss-up between trying either Proactive or Exposed. I decided on Exposed and have been using their products for about a year and a half now. I started buying the kits, which cleared up my acne in only a couple months. I then found that I only needed to use the facial cleanser along with the acne treatment serum in order to maintain clear skin. Exposed puts out great products and they have been worth every penny. My acne has never been too severe but always enough to make me feel self conscious. What I experienced was mostly mild forehead acne and rosacea on my cheeks. Never zits but just a bunch of tiny bumps everywhere- stuff makeup can't hide. So after trying everything in store and even a couple prescription creams I gave this a shot and it was the best decision I've ever made. Most products I have tried are either too extreme for my skin or not enough, being that my acne was only mild but nontheless a nuisance. Within the first three days of using this product I saw a difference. Within ten days my skin was clear. And I haven't worn makeup in two weeks now. This product hasn't dried out my skin nor made it extremely oily. The only negative aspect that I've found so far is that upon occasion it can make my rosacea act up but that usually is easily tamed by outside rosacea moisturizer. I love this product. I recommend by the kit because the cleanser with the tonic and acne serum tends to work best. I started using the starter kit about 6 months ago. This face wash leaves your skin feeling clean, without drying it out. I recently bought a Clarisonic Mia, and I've now started using that to buff in this facewash morning and night. I've noticed a DRAMATIC difference in the effectiveness of this product. I highly recommend buying a Clarisonic and using the Exposed products with it. The Clarisonic deep cleans your skin, allowing the Exposed products to seep into your skin and be most effective. My skin is super soft and nearly completely clear. I highly recommend this product. Also, a little goes a long way. You don't need much of the face wash at a time, so it will last a few months. Enjoy! This product works very good for me.  I've tried proactive for a while which was successful in the beginning but seems like my face got too used to the product and stopped working all together.  I then tried Murad which was the worst acne product and made me break out all over my face for 9 weeks.  Then went to this product which really cleanses my face.  My face has never been more clear and its rare when I do get pimples.  When pimples do come for me no more than two at a time and they're gone within a few days.  My clear skin to even a couple pimples ratio is Clear skin>>>>>Couple pimples.  I use facial cleanser, clearing tonic, and ance treatment serum. As title suggests, cannot live without the cleanser and toner in particular. I had adult acne that I just couldn't get a handle on. Stress would make it worse and I would get bad breakouts particular on my chin. I did a google search out of desperation one day and found a website reviewing the top ten acne products and this was number one. It took about 2 weeks for my skin to settle down and now it's very rare I get a breakout. Love that the website is very easy to use, safe and I am in Australia and shipping is very fast. Could not recommend it higher. Just wish you could buy it in stores. I battled with acne for my entire life and as a professional it was quite embarrassing.  I tried everything in stores and one day went online to do some research and found exposed, that was over 1 year ago.  It is wonderful.  My skin cleared up and while I don't have the best skin genetically it has provided the most long lasting and effective results yet.  yes the bottles are a little small, but one bottle of cleanser and tonic usually lasts about 3 months and it worth every penny! I love this product! I am 30 years old and have suffered from severe acne since the age of 16. My skin is oily, sensitive and very acne-prone, and I have tried most acne products on the market without any good results. When I found the exposed skincare products I was thrilled - they actually work really well! I wash my face with the facial cleanser in the morning and evening, and it is very gentle yet effective on my skin! It controls my acne and it doesn't dry my face out and it leaves my skin looking fresh and clean. I can really recommend this product for people with acne-prone skin. For optimal result, the facial cleanser is best used with other exposed skincare products. Tried other products like Proactive and this is the only thing that has worked on my skin. Used to have horrible acne, now it's clear! It works :) This cleanser has been great for my skin because it does not dry it out and my skin feels clean and fresh after using it. It has helped in clearing up my acne more than any other cleanser I've tried! I've had to be careful with other cleansers not to use them twice a day, but I've been able to use this facial cleanser twice a day to clean my face without over-drying it. I would recommend this for anyone looking for an effective facial cleanser along with the other products on the Exposed Skincare line. Facial Cleanser My daughter struggles with moderate to severe acne.  She has been using Exposed for 5 months now.  It took a while for it to completely clear up but at this point she hasn't had any new breakouts in over month.  Her skin is smooth, glowing and doesn't get dry.  Yes, it's expensive but worth every penny!  It really made a difference. Facial CleanserI am a woman in my late 40's and have suffered from cystic acne for more than 10 years.  I was willing to pay any amount of money if a product worked because I was embarrassed as a woman my age shouldn't have acne.  Not to mention the fact that cystic acne is really painful.  I have tried all kinds of products from very expensive ones to drug store brands.  Nothing holds a candle to this cleanser as well as all other products in this line!  In addition to the cleanser, I do use all products in the basic kit and use them as instructed.  I have been using these products over a year now and have had maybe 3 minor break outs during that time.  It took about 6-8 weeks to get it under control and then it was smooth sailing.  Before using these products, I could not go more than 2 or 3 days without at least one cyst.  My skin is very smooth and soft now and is never feels dried out. My only complaint is that these products are only available on-line.  I would like to see the offered in stores. This product is worth the money and to me is reasonably price considering I've paid much more for other product without achieving the results I was hoping for.  Try it! This is by far the best cleanser I have ever used. I have had acne prone skin for many years, and as I tried what seemed like every cleanser on the market I used to wish that there were something I could use that would be more natural and use less harmful chemicals. The Exposed Cleanser was the answer to my prayers! It combines natural ingredients with helpful chemicals and not only clears up the acne on my skin but also leaves it feeling truly clean. I would recommend this product to anyone! This is the ONLY product I've ever used where my skin feels really clean immediately after use and a dramatic improvement has been noted over only a few short days. I have very sensitive, oily, acne prone skin skin and find that most acne cleaners have either dried my skin out and aggrevated it or doesn't cleanse thoroughly enough and leaves a residue. This cleanser does everything it says on the tin and more. I wouldn't hesitate in reccommending this product for anyone with acne prone skin or is just looking for a cleanser that really cleans your skin. I never leave home without it!! Thanks exposed!! :) I have extremely sensitive skin. Almost every facial cleanser to date has caused my face to break out further or dry and scale. This cleanser, however, has been wonderful. I've used it in conjunction with a clarion face brush and some prescribed acne cream. Works like a charm. It's really easy on your skin and feels smooth afterwards. Highly recommend this product. My kids have been using this product for a few plus months now and have seen great results. They were seeing a doctor who was prescribing different products through the pharmacy and I wasn't seeing anything getting much better. My son asked to try this and he loves it. So easy to order, no doctor appointments and no products with a bunch of chemicals in them. We will continue to use this for as long as we need to. The texture of this cleanser is very comforting I think. I use this product with the Clarisonic brush to remove makeup and wash my face every morning and night. I have a clean smooth skin right after and I am relieved and know for sure that there is no makeup left before I go to bed. I really like this cleanser. and I used to have very very bad acne that made me not want to see anyone or go out at all. This has changed my life a lot! Hope it works for you all too! I am in my late 20's and have tried everything! Everything from drugstore cleansers like Clearasil to mail order products such Murad or Proactive. Every time I have tried a cleanser, if it didn't dry out my skin or irritate it more, eventually it just stopped working after a few months. Well, I got tired of my skin becoming too oily or too dry after using the product for awhile so I tried Exposed. I've been using this for quite some time now and love it! It took about a week and a half to really start clearing up my skin and I had NO reaction to the cleanser. It felt very clean and I didn't need to use much of it. I would highly recommend this to anyone that has tried EVERYTHING and feels like nothing will work, because this cleanser will. I use the Exposed facial cleanser twice a day-once in the morning and once at night. It has been helping clear my skin. I used to have bad acne and it has helped control it. I usually break out bad during the summer time, but I this summer has been the best in my acne being controlled and I can say Exposed Skin care has helped! Get the whole kit to have consistency in your facial cleansing regime. I am in love with Exposed products. They have cleared my face right up and prevented any further outbreaks. I am currently pregnant (a super trigger for many people), but my face has YET to break out at all! My son turned 14 and started having a lot of problems with acne.  Over the counter products did not help much.  Then we started using Pro Active which did help but he was still having break outs.  My sister recommended Exposed Skincare because it really worked well for her daughter.  We decided to try it.  Now my son's skin is much clearer.  Even when he only uses the facial cleanser and treatment serum his skin us relatively clear of breakouts.  He also likes the clear pore serum, clearing tonic and microderm scrub. If you are an active teenager with acne problems, try these products!  My teenagers tried everything available and this was the last resort.  All of these products have worked wonders on getting rid of acne!  This cleanser is not drying, very gentle, and doesn't cause redness.  It works!  Use it in conjunction with the other Exposed products to clear up your skin once and for all.  It's worth a try! I like all of these products! For the first few weeks it actually seems like it's making it worse, as it does almost always with new acne treatment. Seriously, softer, smoother, and clearer skin. My skin is really sensitive, I am very thankful I found this product! Only thing I would change is when ordering the kit, the facial cleanser runs out faster than the other products. Obviously, because you use that product twice a day, where the others are used only once. I liked this product because it is not harsh. Iy cleans the clean without over-drying and irritating.  I used to use Proactiv, but it o my made my acne worse because it was too harsh. For $15, this face wash is pretty cheap compared to most acne washes. I would recommend it. I use this product every day, once in the morning and once at night. Other products make my face more oily later in the day but this does not make my face all oily. Very satisfied. After using the Exposed Skin Care Treatmeant kit for about a year, I am happy to say that I have been able to maintain the positive results by continuing using the Facial Cleanser and Acne Treatment when needed. I have very sensitive skin and am prone to dryness. This cleanser is mild and gentle. I use it twice a day and my skin does not dry out like it has with other products. I love the entire exposed skin care system. It has changed the look and texture of my skin. Ill never stop using it! I have very sensitive skin and I searched high and low for a product that would be effective in clearing up my acne before my wedding. Exposed Skin Care Has been a blessing for my skin. The whole line is amazing and I highly recommend every single product they have to offer! Great cleanser! It is gentle yet effective.  It doesn't dry out my skin like harsh cleansers.  If I have on make-up I remove it before hand so that the ingredients can work their best. This Exposed facial cleanser is awesome. I am 43 years old and still have acne. It controls the acne, yet does not dry out my skin, which at my age, you have to start worrying about wrinkles. My face feels clean and refreshed. I also like to use the derma cloth at least twice a week with it for a deep clean. I highly recommend this cleanser. The exposed skin care products are very effective, especially the facial cleanser which starts by cleaning away all the dirt and greasy build-up very effectively. I ran out of this product some time ago and thought I could get away without using it, but no other cleanser comes close so I soon put in an order for two more bottles!! Excellent Best face wash I ever used ! Very gentle on the face . Those for have sensitive skin this you would like ! Won't regret using this product ! I sure dont ! I use this facial cleanser in the morning and at night. It works great! Other cleansers are too harsh and dry out my skin, but not this!! This cleared up my skin quickly, and my skin tone has improved greatly. It's a bit drying, but gets the job done. I really like using the Exposed facial cleanser as it doesn't dry out my skin and works wonderfully at cleaning it.  I use it in conjunction with the entire Exposed skin care kit and my skin has never looked so great!  I truly love Exposed Skin Care products and have been using them for years and am very satisfied.  I would highly recommend giving them a try!Facial Cleanser Best product out! Couldn't live without it! I've tried lots of other alternatives but none compare to Exposed. I also love how you can create subscriptions so you get what you need shipped whenever you need it. This is a great face wash for every day and night. It goes great with the microdermabrasion cloth that Exposed sells. Really am grateful for the help in clearing up my skin. I'm in my 30s, and while I don't have acne, I get the occasional bumps under my skin on my jawline and chin. I've tried other acne products before, but they always dried out my skin and didn't work. I have sensitive skin and I've been using this cleanser for about 4 years now. It's effective without irritating skin. It's better than any acne cleanser I've used before. This face wash is amazing! I have been using this product for 10 years. It doesn't dry your skin out and rarely have any breakouts! This is one of those products you cant live without! You feel like you are doing something great for your skin every time you use it. I can definitely tell a big difference when I run out of it. Facial cleanser is one of the best around.  Better than proactive and anything you can buy at Walgreens or CVS.  It is very gentle and does not over dry. Exposed facial cleanser is great for leaving the skin clean and clear. I used to have many breakouts and finding the exposed skincare system has been the best thing for my skin. I have been using it for 5 years now. I recommend using the toner after using the cleanser, if sensitive skin, start out using at nighttime and gradually increasing. This product works great. It gives a clean/refreshing feeling that is meant to be beneficial to your acne. The product is small, but  requires very little as it lathers great. this cleaning product is phenomenal.  I have pretty sensitive skin, but exposed never gave me any issues.  I've been acne free for over a year, and glad everyday that I made the switch.  Very effective and a good value compared to other products out there. This is the second customer review I've ever written. Since everyone's skin is different I can't say that this product will work perfectly for everyone but I can say in complete honesty that this product is the ONLY product that has improved my skin and greatly reduced my acne. Other products, especially Proactiv, deeply scarred my skin. I use this everyday twice a day and it has significantly reduced my breakouts. I also like that the formula they use includes a lot of natural substances. This cleanser is FAB-U-LOUS! I know that for me it's been hard to find a product that would help my acne and not destroy my skin in the process. This cleanser is gentle enough for my VERY sensitive skin but also pleasantly effective. My skin feels so clean, refreshed and balanced after using this cleanser. Plus, a little goes a long way so you get a lot for your money. This cleanser is great. It is the first I've used in years to treat stubborn acne that does not leave my face dry or stinging, but still gets the job done. It's a small bottle, but a little goes a long way. I've been ordering the Exposed kits for a few months now and my skin has improved a lot. Highly recommend this product. The Exposed cleanser is by far my daughter's favorite cleanser.  We have tried other products and this one has worked the best by far.  The customer service for these products far exceeds any other companies we have ordered from.  We are extremely happy with their products. Hands down the best facial cleanser on the market. Nothing else compares. Unlike other cleansers this can be used twice daily without drying out your skin. Best used with other exposed skincare products. Exposed Facial Cleanser cleans my face without drying it out which is perfect since I like to use it both morning and night. Exposed Skin Care is the best and affordable option for acne! It has amazing effects and it works just as well as the top, more expensive skin care products. This is a wonderful product. I have extremely sensitive skin and I'm able to use this twice a day with no overdrying or break outs. Highly recommend it!"
B005LZT9EM," One of the best products on the market. I love this face wash- it has made a huge difference in my skin!  I also use the moisturizer and love both! Just be careful not to use too much and be sure to dilute with water. If you use too much product it may make your skin irritated. I love, love, love this product. It really does what it says it will do and it really agrees with my skin. This is the first face wash I have purchased because of my overly sensitive skin and this choice was perfect. It really cleanses gently and clarifies as well as work on any acne that is on my skin or below the surface. All other cleansers that I have used caused allergic rashes that took days to go away. I had no reactions whatsoever with this product. I am so glad I that I found it, thanks to Organic Olivia on Youtube. She uses this product and I saw how amazing her skin looks and I decided to give it a try. Best decision!The only negative is that on my repurchase recently some of the product spilled within the plastic packaging as the dispenser was on ""open"" instead of ""close"" so I had to deal with the spill after opening the plastic bag packaging but I will certainly keep buying this product as long as the formula remains the same and the results as well. I read about this on Byrdie.com, and was immediately drawn to it when it said it was for acne prone skin. I don't have terrible acne, but I do have annoying bumps and blackheads and breakouts.I am super impressed with this product. It's all natural which is so important because your skin is absorbing all the ingredients you are putting on it, so the fact that these ingredients are all natural acne fighters is a plus.This product really tackled my breakouts but was gentle enough for everyday use. I noticed that the overall condition of my skin was improving from daily use of this cleanser. Highly recommend! my son had the worst acne ever. We do a lot of all natural things we treat for biofilms yeast overgrowth and all sorts of stuff and we have tamed it someone within 3 days of using this product with the lotion that goes with it his face was completely clear it was the final piece to our puzzle to helping him with clear skin. I love this cleanser. I have probably 20 different cleansers and really did not need another one but I love this brand and have never been disappointed by it. This is not a foaming cleanser. It is a cream. It has a wonderful smell and this is an organic product This is wonderful.  It does NOT remove makeup or tinted moisturizer at all for me, but I use it in the morning and it leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.  I was having some trouble with milia because I have really dry skin and this helped to keep my skin moist and so I have much fewer than before I started using it. This stuff is amazing. This wash is free of harsh chemicals, and keeps my skin clear.I was skeptical that I could clear my skin by nourishing it. Those persistent, lone, painful zits that never came to a head or stuck around for weeks are a thing of the past.Use this product! It is a game changer. I really love this product.  It's pricy,but a very little goes a long way, so it lasts longer.  I act got the wrong product,  but even then, I am pleased with Eminence. I have been looking for a daily cleanser that doesn’t cause even more issues than my acne prone combination skin already does. This product is the winner! It doesn’t make my skin oily, nor does it dry it up. I have less pimples than ever before in my life. This stuff smells amazing! The other day I noticed I had ingrown angry skin after shaving my thighs so I used some of this magic potion. Poof! Absolute, magic goodness! I love this face cleanser. I am 42 years old & I started having red flare-ups on my nose along with little white pimples. This cleanser has helped clear my nose tremendously. It smells good, lasts a long time & works great with the Clara sonic. This cleanser is amazing. I have the occasional pimple but this stuff has cleared up my skin so beautifully. If I do get a pimple it is so much smaller than before....but that is if I get one! The whole eminence line is AMAZING!!!! I have been struggling for years with adult acne. My skin is to sensitive for regular acne medication and breaks out easily if not for natural products. However, this facewash has worked wonders in just the few days I’ve been using it. All the irritation and break outs are gone. I definitely recommend without a doubt! This is a good product and at the beginning it did work but ive been breaking out more lately. This Cleanser is a must have! It smells great and does wonders on my combo/oily skin. I love their products and can't be without this one! I love this product.  I started getting facials during my pregnancy to combat pregnancy acne without having to try harsh over the counter products as well as my doctor put the Dermatologist off limits during the pregnancy.  The lady recommended this product and what can I say I love it!! So much cheaper on Amazon too.  It cleans my skin without drying it out too much.  There is a distinct smell to it but it doesn't stay on your skin.  Only 1 pump is needed to wash your face.  I think the bottle will last a long time too. This is the best face wash I have ever used. Many acne washes use chemicals, which strip the moisture and nutrients from your face leaving your skin dry. This wash uses all natural ingredients, has great lather to clear bacteria and leaves my face feeling cool and refreshed every time. Love this product!  It is the only thing that keeps my son's face clear.  He's 17 and I use it for oily skin and large pores. I love Eminence products but this cleanser in particular is a must have. My face is really sensitive and doesn't react well to products unless they're organic/natural. Anyone can use it but this face wash is specifically for people who have breakouts, it definitely helps keep my skin clear and calms it. It doesn't dry your face out but you should still always use a moisturizer after your wash your face, eminence has a probiotic moisturizer that goes with this face wash and i love it! Only thing i was disappointed with was how long it took for my package to arrive it was 2 days late. I live by this. I use to have horrible acne and the clear skin line has helped me control it! I have used this product for two years and love it.  It comes of squeaky clean and doesn't dry out my skin. I regularly give this to my niece for birthday and Xmas.  She uses this, along with the Probiotic Moisturizer, and also the Rubarb Dermafoliant.  Eminence is such a nice quality line product line without all the toxic chemicals that are commonly used in many health and beauty aid products. Getting away from all the yucky chemicals has such a huge difference in her skin. My favorite Eminence skin wash This is by far the best skin cleanser I have ever tried. Any other cleanser I have used has been sold at the drugstores. I have used products such as Olay, Clean and Clear, and so on... and all of them have irritated my eyes and have seemed to not have any redeeming effects. The clear skin probiotic cleanser by Eminence does not make it so I do not have acne, but it calms and soothes it and helps the acne heal quicker, oppose to drying out my face and making it worse.For reference I have fair skin and I am prone to pimples around my chin and mouth that pop and then get flakey and turn red. The pimples seem to come from eating cheese... believe it or not. Therefore, with this ultra soothing cleanser and a good diet I am on my way to wonderful beautiful skin. Cleared up my skin very quickly! It is not a strong product but is very effective. I have oily, acne prone skin and it worked great. I only wish it wasn't as expensive! I've been using this for about a year now and will continue to use. Love it!!! Awesome product! Eminence is my all time favorite skin care line . Hands down the best face wash I've ever used. Kiss the drug store face wash good bye! The only skincare I need to make my acne go away. I use this and coconut oil as a moisturizer. Love that I'm using a reputable brand without harsh/bad chemicals. Face feels so clean, helped with my acne. Doesn't dry out the skin. I can't use any other product after trying this one Both of my kids have used this product. My son had acne scaring from his uncontrolled acne. The product has all but eliminated the scaring and the acne is gone. My daughter uses it too and she has a beautiful completion now. I have always struggled with a little bit of acne. This definitely keeps it at bay and makes my skin feel amazing! It is really clearing my skin up! This is a wonderful product. It was recommended for me as I have dry skin and in my sixties. Goes a long way, gentle & very pleasant smell. I love this Company's products! I really like this cleanser! It cleans the skin without making it dry.I feel it is helping with the break outs.I would recommend this product. I was hesitant at first as I have acne prone skin.  I typically stick with what works, but thought I would give this a try as recommended by the spa therapist.  This is a wonderful product.  The smell first of all will keep you coming back.  All the natural ingredients work well.  And best of all my acne is still under control.  It takes very little of the product to do the job! This product is about the only thing that actually helps my sensitive-combination-acne-prone skin. It is incredibly soothing to the skin and the smell is amazing. If I could bathe in this stuff I would! Works well, I use this twice a day with the moisturizer and its helping clear my acne. Excellent product-- a must have for perfect complexion and clean/smooth/acne free face. I love this product!! I bought this on the recommendation of my dermatologist and love it. It is lightweight but still does a great job cleaning my combination skin without drying it out. It also lasts a long time since I only need one pump to feel like I've sufficiently cleaned my face. Definitely worth the cost and will continue to purchase. I'll never run out of this skin care product again.  It takes years off of your appearance naturally! Best face wash for acne prone skin I love this product. Use it for 3 years already. Morning and night. I've used this face wash for years. My absolute favorite. I have very sensitive, acne proned skin but this is so moisturizing and doesn't ever break me out. This product makes my face smooth, feel moisturized and it does help my oily/dry combo skin type that I have. Also, I live in an area that we experience all types of temperatures throughout the year... (cold thru hot). I also had issues with acne and I am in my mid 20's so this was really exciting that I was noticing fewer break-outs on my face. In addition, it has been healing the red marks on my face from previous break-outs. I would highly recommend this product. Best face wash ever!! My favorite cleanser of all time. It washes away dirt and makeup. No harsh smell and no residue left behind. Love! Love it The best in the market This product is wonderful.  I have suffered from acne most of my life, and I feel as though I finally found a face wash that works! My skin is smoother and brighter than ever before.  I would recommend this face wash to anyone. The ONLY thing that will work on my daughters face for her acne. Cannot use anything else! I have very sensitive skin and this soap works great for me.  It isn't a cure all for acne, but it feels great and is organic which is a plus.  This soap doesn't suds a lot, but enough so that your skin will feel clean. The product arrived much sooner than stated and was pleasantly surprised. Amazing product that works great on sensitive skin! I suffer from adult acne.  I switched from department store, glycolic cleansers to Eminence because the other Eminence products are working wonders.  This cleanser never leaves my skin dry and any small breakouts never get a chance to fester. This product really helped clear up my skin. I have tried a lot of different cleansers for my sensitive reactive skin and this has been by far my favorite! Great price! I like it and use it twice a day. Love this product! Great price and pretty quick shipping 😀 Love this product I love this line! This cleanser is awesome. It keeps my skin from breaking out and feels awesome. It is hard to find in stories so I love that Amazon has it. It is all natural as well! Great product I have been using this product for my combinatiuon skin and found it to clean my skin well without leaving it dry, and my face is very smooth afterward. I would definitely purchase again, as well as the Firm Skin Acai masque. This stuff has pushed my regimen over the edge! I have been dealing with acne for over 15 years, better, worse, back and forth. I finally went to a dermatologist and cannot take acutane because I am nursing.  She put me on glycolic acid and a rosacea cream. It was helping but drying my face out and burning.Then I added this, my first probiotic cleanser, and it made a world of difference.  When I apply and begin to rub it in, I need a second pump because it's like my face just absorbs it and wants more! My skin is supple and soft and my acne continues to get better.  The clearing of the acne could easily be from just continued application of the Rx products, but the soft, moisturized effect is definitely from this cleanser. Love this product. Eminence is amazing. I love this face wash! I absolutely love this face wash. It feels so cleansing and refreshing and has done a wonderful job at keeping my skin clear. I love this cleanser. Love this product My favorite Eminence cleanser.  I won't use anything else. More spa stuff from Hawaii. My wife loves this stuff and it is about 1/3 less on Amazon. Great consistency. Smells amazing and cleans skin fresh but not stripped. As always, I love Eminence products.  I have been using this cleanser for about two years now.  The Eminence probiotic line for acne is controlling my acne far better than other chemical laden products. Smells wonderful! Good experience with seller. I love to use this cleanser. I have no dryness after using it. Great product. Arrived timely Love this faceal cleanser. I have bad rosacea with pimples and it really helped clear up my skin. The only problem is that the pump was broken:( Great item and timely delivery.  Love it,. Love this cleanser. Leaves skin soft and renewed. I first experienced the Eminence line when I went to a spa that carries this line and this line only. Within a few days, my skin was clearer and less oily. This is the only face wash I use now and I won't go to a spa and get a facial unless they use Eminence in all of their facials! Thank you I can't say enough about this product! It will take off any makeup you have on. I won't buy any other face wash. Love it!!! One product that's truly taken my acne away!! Smells great and it's all natural and organic ! Amazing! Thank you!  I have been using Eminence products for the last 6 months and completely love them.  My skin is looking great! I have dealt with cystic and hormonal acne since I was 16. I have always had bad breakouts that come up seemingly from nowhere, and have tried almost every product out on the market, even prescriptions. Nothing worked and I thought I would just have to learn to live with my acne. Then my spa gave me a sample of this Probiotic Cleanser. Within a week I saw a huge difference in my skin, after two months my acne is all but gone. I get a stray pimple or two here or there, but for someone who used to have true problems with cystic acne, this is a miracle product.I don't use this as a wash but more as a treatment. I wash my face with Eminence Mineral Cleanser and then rub a small amount of this on my face twice a day. I leave it on, I do not rinse it off. I then put the eminence grapefruit c gel and then my philosphy clear makeup primer. My skin is literally glowing and clear. There are actually days I go without makeup now, which I haven't been able to do in at least 10 years.This is a 10-star product. Great product. Slowly getting rid of my chronic acne works well on my skin and organic.  i have had a lot of acne and this product along with the Tomato and Garlic masque really have helped my skin! Great product! Wonderful product, ethically produced, great quality and really good value for money for such a good product.  You only use a small amount so it should last me ages.  Smells awesome too! Love this cleaner...great for problem skin...it's creamy and leaves a clean face. I have bought this item from this seller a few times with no problem. Very good cosmetics! The place I go to for my facials recommended this product for, ahem, 40-ish skincare?  The only thing is that their price tag was pretty high.  I figured I'd check Amazon....(the first place I usually go to before I purchase anywhere else).  Glad I did. Better priced, and I received it quickly.  I love the way it makes my skin feel.  Clean, soft, and not tight.  Bonus: I liked the way it smells.  I've tried a number of products specifically for anti-aging, with a dose of adult acne (what fun!).  I was using Patricia Wexler's products (Bath & Body Works) which worked for a few years but this year, it started leaving me with flaky skin patches that no moisturizer could correct.  I switched to Murad which left me oily but still with those stubborn dry patches on my forehead and nose!  A few days after using this cleanser, my dry flaky patches cleared up.  I also noticed smaller pores and fewer acne flare-ups.  I've been using it for over a month now, and so far so good.  I'm about halfway finished with the bottle.  As long as it still works for me, I'll purchased it again. love the product, loved the price Love this product! Love this cleanser for acne prone skin!!!!!!!!  Definitely a favorite and I've tried many products Excellent product! Has helped me with clearing up and preventing acne. amazing. All zips gone completely The product woeks well on the acne prone mature skin The facial cream for the face.💯💯 I love the this product! A very good cleanser and helps the texture of my skin!  Nice clean scent as well. it's natural and not rough on your face nor does it dry up your skin. Wash my face 2x a day. Love it Fresh scent, leaves my skin clean without stripping moisture. Lasts longer than I thought! I'm very happy w my purchase. I've been using this for almost two weeks and so far I love it. I have incredibly sensitive facial skin and have not been able to use any cleansers for a long time because everything I used made my face break out in hot and painful red splotches. I have acne and combination oily/dry skin so my acne gets worse without cleanser, but cleansers do the aforementioned splotching and really dry out my skin. A friend recommended this to me because she uses it for her sensitive skin and it is natural so I thought i would give it a go.I am amazed that after such a short time I am already seeing a difference in my skin. It has begun to feel smoother and it feels clean without excessive dryness (I do experience small dry patches, but nothing bothersome and they may stop in time). The smell of the product isn't my favorite, but it isn't unbearable and goes away once I wash my face of the cleanser and you don't need much product so I estimate that one bottle will last me awhile. The greatest part for me is that I have not had any painful allergic reactions so I can keep using it. I have spent hundreds on store products that did nothing for me but give me allergic reactions and now this $30 bottle is actually helping me. I am really happy with this and will be buying it a lot in the future.If ordering from Amazon - know that it is cheaper, but it will take while to ship to you so be prepared to wait a few weeks My skin is so much clearer after only a month. This product is good for all types of skin especially acne prone. My skin cleared up quickly after using this product. Fast shipping, item as described. Really works great! I use it in combination with my prescription medication and it keeps my face oil free and blemish free! I use only Eminence products on my face since it is the best product in the market out there, they are pricey but worth every penny! Cleared my skin, only cleanser I will ever use.  This is the best skin care line.  So happy I found it. This makes my face feel extra clean! A mild, but cleanse like nothing else. very organic gentle and smells great.  I also bought their lotion and recommend all of their products to any skin type! This has really helped my sensitive skin and my dermatitis. as advertised Great cleanser for acne prone skin. Keeps my skin clear and soft. I've used multiple difference facial cleansers over the years, price not being a barrier.  If there was something better, I would try it.  Well, that all stopped when I discovered the Eminence VitaSkin Clear Skin Priobiotic cleanser.  This is the best cleanser for combination skin -- leaves my skin feeling refreshed, clean and not stripped, raw and irritated.  I have recommended this cleanser and the entire line of Clear Skin products to everyone I know.  Seeing how well it worked for me, my general physician now recommends this product line to his patients suffering from acne, teens and adults alike. This cleanser is refreshing and leaves my skin feeling really good.  It is the first natural facial cleanser that I have tried and it works really well for my skin, which is acne-prone. i have acne/problem skin and this product after only 1 1/2 weeks of use has made such a huge difference in my skin. i use it in conjunction with the mineral cleansing concentrate when my skin is really oily or i feel it needs a better clean and i can say i will absolutely be re buying this when i finish with it. i only use half a pump so i know ill be using this first bottle for a longgg time. it smells really nice, like cucumber and it feels cooling when i wash my face. my skin is looking so much better already- definitely buy if you have acne skin Best Facial Wash !!!! Expecially for acne skin. I love this eminence line of products. My face feels so clean, but not dried out at all. I've had good success with this product. LOVE THIS PRODUCT Very good cleanser that even removes makeup! LOVE this line of products. This is my favorite cleanser.  I was ""acne prone"" well into my 40s and was so frustrated until an esthetician recommended this.  I've been using it for over two years and my skin is noticeably clearer.  I would not even consider switching.  Note; a little goes a LONG way.  Since there is little or no water in the product, I apply a small amount with wet hands.  It may seem expensive, but a bottle lasts a really long time. If you suffer from acne or just have sensitive skin this is the cleanser for you!  I have used this cleanser for over a year & have not had to change it out.  With many other products it seems my skin becomes immune & I have to rotate.  I have not had this experience with the VitaSkin Cleanser.  This is a gentle light cleanser that will not irritate and leaves your face with the clean refreshing feeling.  I also add in the Eminence Strawberry Rhubarb to this cleanser if I need additional exfoliate. I have been using this product for over 3 years ever since it was used on me in a Hawaiian spa during a facial. I really feel like it kills bacteria and gives my face a fresh start. I also use Eminence Probiotic moisturizer and I like that as well. As someone who has battled adult acne this really helps and is natural with no chemicals or strange ingredients you can't pronounce. I first came across this face wash when I was at the spa at a resort in Hawaii. Got a facial and the facialist used this product. It was wonderful and I decided to buy it for use at home. I love this stuff... it smells so good (like cucumbers) and leaves my skin so soft and clean... After not too long my acne got better (I was also using some benzyl peroxide wipes, but I've been using them along with other cleansers in the past and never had such good results as I did with eminence.) I'm definitely going to keep buying this stuff! My esthetician recommended this product, and I've been hooked ever since.  It's light, milky, and cleans thoroughly.  I'm accustomed to sudsy cleansers, but they tend to dry my skin.  With acne prone skin, I need deep cleansing while maintaining moisture, and this product does it for me.  My skin feels refreshed, squeaky clean, and when I rub on toner, I rarely see any residue on the facial pad.It's pricey, but it lasts me at least a month.  And the fact that it's organic makes me feel better. I love this face wash! Have been buying from a spa in my area but found cheaper price here, so very happy about that! Eminence is one of the only product lines that really works to get rid of my acne. Love this face wash!!!  I have rosacea and this plus the Probiotic moisturizer they make has helped more than anything else, including Metrogel. The company used to make this and their moisturizer 100% chemical free, but I noticed a few months ago they have started adding sodium benzoate. I don't know much about that, but I did like it better when all the ingredients were all-natural. I still use this, though, and I think it does wonders for my skin- especially for reducing rosacea bumps. I have had so many issues with my skin (pregnant and nursing really made my skin horrible), so I have been using this to balance my pH and I think it has worked wonders.  Of course, I am using it in conjunction with moisturizers and a masque from eminence so they are all working together wonderfully.  I also use a clarisonic I have been using this product for a couple years now and my skin is as good as it has ever been. If you have sensitive skin then this product is great for you as it is very gentle and works very well. The only real downside to this is the price, but at the end of the day if you want a quality organic product that you can put on your skin and not worry about all having a million chemicals or sensitivity to the product then this is for you. great facial cleanser! I LOVE this product so much that I purchased a separate bottle to keep in the shower as well as one on the counter.  I was having MAJOR problems with acne - and I am 48 years young.  This product cleanses my skin thoroughly without stripping - it does not produce a lot of foam - therefore, non-drying.  Worth every penny!!. I love this cleanser; I have had acne most of my life, and love how this is targeted towards sensitive skin like mine! After using, my face feels very hydrated and soft. I also love how natural it smells, this makes me confident I'm using an organic cleanser. My face no longer gets that tight feeling after using generic brands, and my blemishes have definitely decreased. 100% recommend for sensitive and acne prone skin types! This product is great. I juse a exfoliant from them as well and love it. There stuff is more expensive but it is made with the best ingredients, no harsh chemicals and all organic. I love the smells and the way my skin feels after use. My skin is more acne prone and very sensitive, and this cleanser works great and has helped with my breakouts. I have adult acne and oily/combination skin, so I was looking for something that would not clog up the pores. This is an outstanding cosmetic line that is not tested on animals (I am a huge animal fan) and still does the job of clearing the skin. I would recommend using it with the other probiotic products of the same brand to get the best results. Eminence is the only product I will use from now on. This product is wonderful! My teenage boys faces cleared right up. I use it to. No problems with breakouts ever but i notice a difference in my pores & texture of my skin. Even had people comment on how good we all look. I am a 42 year old that still suffers with acne. I have been using it for over 2 years since esthetician at Hyatt Lost Pines Spa used it and recommended it. I was able to stop using the harsher drying Proactive that I used for years before that. I love it. I first purchased this at a local spa were I got a facial and the lady recommended these products to me. I really love the way it makes my skin feel! Soft and smooth, not too dry or tight. It really helps with the occasional breakouts I was having too. A little pricey, but a little goes a long way! THIS IS A REALLY GREAT SKIN CARE CLEANSER NON DRYING. IF YOU HAVE OILY SKIN THIS PRODUCT WILL BE PERFECT FOR YOU. Great product! my oily skin has never looked so good.I didnt think it would make so much difference but it has.I will definitely purchase this again. My friend uses this product, so I decided to try it.  I love it.  It feels great on my skin, and leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh after I wash it.  I will definitely buy it again. great cleanser!  smells good and does its job without nasty chemicals the first eminence product i used was the probiotic masque, which i loved ( it feels oxygenating and exhilerating on your skin!). This masque helpd a lot; i use it 1-2x/week.Then my esthetician recommended the probiotic cleanser as well. naturally, i purchased it on Amazon!I have moderately oily/acneic adult african american skin and i live in a very humid area (alabama). i can honestly say this is the best  my skin has looked in the spring-->approaching summer. Usually my face is broken out (almost constantly and always looks like an oils-slick. i also have some hormonal/cystic acne; these pimples are fairly deep and very large. i have even noticed a reduction in these bad boys with the probiotic cleanser! The cleanser is a good size and it has been keeping my large acne at bay.  After washing with it, my face feels clean and not oily. I highly recommend this product ! I've been using this face wash for nearly a year now. It was recommended to me by an esthetician during a facial. I have been ""blessed"" with adult acne, especially around my chin, nose and jaw line. I use several prescription topicals day and night. This face wash does a great job keeping my skin hydrated with all the drying products I use daily. As a bonus, it has helped keep my breakouts under control during my pregnancy. This is my 3rd child, and my skin is especially bad when I'm pregnant (Pregnancy ""glow"" my arse). This wash has really helped this time around. I truly notice a difference. This is my first time purchasing off Amazon, I originally bought this at a day spa after getting a facial. I was getting really bad hormonal breakouts (re: deep painful pimples) on my forehead and nothing I was using seemed to be working to control it. My face has been clear of problems since I started using this face wash and it doesn’t hurt that it has all the benefits of a natural/organic product...so no harsh chemicals. I have had problem pop up zits due to hormonal changes for a few years, and this stuff really worked! I also have been doing a lot of research about cancer causing chemicals that are in most facial products. I found out about this product at a resort I was staying at, so I tried it. Man did my skin feel great, and still does. I did notice a change in my face, my skin is softer, my pores are more controlled, and any old small acne scars are dissapearing. I also use the probiotic masque 1 to 2 times a week. I dont use the probiotic moisturizer, because it does not moisturizer as well as the Eminence VitaSkin Calm Skin Chamomile Moisturizer does. Plus the moisturizer gets rid of redness and makes you skin feel like a babies bottom. Totally soft and smooth!!!  I would very much recommend this stuff to anyone. I also love that it's completely organic, made with herbs, plants, all natural ingredients that are healthier for your skin. Totally worth the price! I've been using emminence for the past 3 years.  The probiotic face wash has helped to keep my acne under control.  I recently tried another product by them and while I like it, my face is breaking out from it.  I will go back to the probiotic face wash. I have used very over the counter products and nothing works and so i decide to try this out and OMG its works please believe me it makes my skin soft and clear and just amazing and that's because i'm used to having pimples everywhere and ingrown pimples especially hormone related pimples but all gone now. Please try! This stuff was the final push that took me to completely clear skin, even through pms! Over the past 4+ years now, I've taken just about every measure possible to clean up my health/remove chemicals from my care regimen. Changing my diet to an auto-immune protocol was the first big boon to my skin. Then removing chemicals in makeup/moisturizers/skin care (the whole Eminence line is great, btw). My skin was looking pretty nice but I'd still get the couple of pms pimples once a month. NO MORE WOO HOO!!!!  I really didn't expect this result, but I was slowly changing all my skin care over to this brand & this was a really happy outcome. I'm averaging one small zit every 2 months -seriously. It's fantastic. Very happy with the product & will be re-ordering. After a myriad of acne treatments I finally resorted to Acutane, a medication that is hell on skin, but for some provides a lasting cure for acne. Instead I ended up with incredibly sensitive, flakey, red, and dry/oily combo skin. I n the throes of these horrors I found eminence with a moisturizer that saved my life. faced with what to do after Acutane I found the Clear Skin Probiotic line to keep my skin clear. It is AMAZING! Not only does it keep my skin matte, and acne-free, but it has reduced old scars. It doesn't irritate my sensitive skin, but works well on keeping the oily areas under control. I would definitely recommend this product, but I won't be purchasing the Clear Skin moisturizer again as it wasn't thick enough for me. I use this in combination with clear-biotic supplements and could not be happier with that combo. Eminence works on skin and for me works fast. The supplement seems to prevent major stress breakouts or acne from poor diet since it works in gut. By far excellent skin care cream. My daughter was just getting the start of acne.  This wash took care of it within a few days and doesn't have the harsh chemicals that most products have. I just recently got this product and have already seen a difference in my skin. I get minor breakouts on my chin/cheeks, but since I started using this cleanser, the pimples and blemishes are nearly non-existent. I am a major fan and the fact that the product is organic and free of chemicals is just a bonus!One thing that I find funny is that no one here has mentioned the SMELL. That is the one downfall to this product - it does not smell very nice at all! BUT - I don't think anyone here is using the product solely for how it smells, but rather, how it helps keep acne-prone skin clear. As long as you finish with a nice toner and/or moisturizer you shouldn't be able to smell the cleanser at all.I will buy this product again. :) This is the best face wash I HAVE EVER USED!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED IF YOU HAVE ACNE PRONE SKIN I use this with the Clear Skin Probiotic Masque and absolutely love it.  I wanted to review this product because I read a past review that said this cleanser was not good for pregnant women because it had salicylic acid in it-- that is absolutely not true. In all of Eminence's Clear Skin Probiotic products there is no salicylic acid used.  All of Eminence products are safe to use while pregnant. If you are pregnant and worried about it, you can call Eminence's customer service number and they will tell you the same thing. Even the list of ingredients for this product on the Eminence official website states that there is no salicylic acid in this product. I have used this cleanser for yearsss now!  I started using it in response to a hormonal breakout that I could not get under control with any other cleanser that I tried.  I cleared up instantly and I haven't had a problem with breakout since but continue using it to prevent breakout. This is the best face wash I have ever used! I have always struggled with removing all my makeup and the Vitaskin Clear Skin Priobiotic Cleanser does the trick! My face just feels so refreshed afterwards. More fragrant than i would like, but it works wonders for the skin This was a lifesaver for my skin! I bought it because I am pregnant and could not use my usual acne medication and I use it along with the probiotic moisturizer and it is GREAT. Cleared up my skin pretty well and my face is never oily or dry anymore (I have combination skin). I use to have oily skin by the end of the work day but not anymore! Definitely worth the money if you have tried other things only for them not to work! amazing product, I love this and the moisturizer. I have been trying to get on a health kick lately because I have been super fatigued and just generally worn out.  I went to the doctor and found out I had IBS.  Not happy!   So I started looking into the different things I could do.  Not only did I get on a green tea kick but I also discovered the world of probiotics.  My husband bought me a ton of stuff like books, extracts and powders.  The only one I can remember off the top of my head is this one: Probiotics Ultra Blend Supplement - Complete Probiotic Complex With Acidophilus, Bifidobacterium Longum & More - 40 Billion Live Cultures Per Tab - As Recommended By Dr Oz For Men & Women - Safe & No Side Effects - 60 Convenient Tablets (Not Powder Or P....  Now all of my beauty products are probiotic as well.  It has turned my skin super soft.  There are a lot of good books on Amazon about them.  My coworker has acid reflux and I gave him a few days' worth of the supplement.  He said he didn't even need to take his prevacid on the third day.  Woot!  Go me!"
B002SVA3R4," I have dry skin problems and this is the gentlest thing I've ever tried. Great product, cleans without leaving excess oil on the surface of my skin. No itching, no burning, no allergenic reactions.  Just clean, clear skin with a wonderful scent to boot! My go to cleanser. Mild and takes away all the difprt lean skin wonderfully clean! I use a small bit to wash my face twice a day. It's amazing! Great Gentle on my sensitive skin and keeps me from breaking out - love it - use it with the cleanser Love this stuff.  Works great.  Smells amazing.  Always makes me relax when I take deep breaths while I'm washing my face. Still my reigning favorite! This cleanser makes your face glow. Really nice smell too. this is the same as i have purchased from Aveda I love the product. Its an original Aveda. I have been using this product for a longer time, and I must to say I'm very impressed. You can save more money buying online. great buy It is exactly what you need from a mild cleaning agent. Like it! I LOVE this stuff!!!  It smells great.  My face looks and feels clean after using it.  It doesn't burn or irritate my skin in any way.  The lotion doesn't make my skin feel greasy and it doesn't break me out.  A little bit goes along way.  I know it is expensive, but it is well worth it!  You only need one squirt of lotion and one squirt of the face wash.  I recommend this product to anyone. I have used this for years - LOVE IT!!  Hope they never change it!  I also love their face lotion. The scent is great and it leaves my skin feeling refreshed. It does not dry out my skin or cause burning (like so many others). Not to mention, my face is the clearest it has ever been! BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!It was recommended to me by a friend. I am a makeup artist and had the worst time with my oily, combination, acne prone skin. It is worth every penny, I purchased this line; cleanser, toner, and lotion. As well as, the tourmaline exfoliating face wash and moisturizer. My only regret is that I didn't buy the largest available sizes. It cleared my skin right up, and it's never looked better :) I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. no awful reactions, just clean skin - I will continue to buy Aveda products as long as they uphold their standards repeat purchase.Price was qujite a bit higher when I checked @ a salon.Don't think the convenience was worth the additional $. I have acne prone skin and like many others have ""tried everything.""  I like using this product knowing that the ingredients are ""good for you"" as they are ""all natural.""  It seems to be the most simple thing to keep my skin under control.  It is expensive, but the large bottle lasts for quite some time if you just use one pump per use.  I do not however recommend the moisturizer that is in the same set.. like many other reviews it leaves the skin oily oily oily.  I do love the liquid exfoliator, and spray though Yes, this cleanser is relatively expensive, but after having used it I will never go back to any other facial scrub. Not only does it clean and exfoliate, it also leaves my skin soft and hydrated -- particularly when used in conjunction with the Aveda moisturizer.The really nice bit about this cleanser is that though it comes in a tiny 5oz bottle, that's enough gel to keep your face clean for six months. In that light the price tag doesn't seem too outrageous. This stuff makes my face feel amazing.  Never have I actually seen the positive resluts that a cleanser claims to give.  Aveda Botanicald did everything I needed.  It cleared my skin, my pores got smaller and it is all natural.  Yay! Hi all, been using this gel cleanser for ages and its a perfect, general gel cleanser/make up remover.  It smells like herbal and wonderful and it gets sudsy like one would expect a gel cleanser would.  Note* These products now only come in plastic bottles -Aveda phased out the glass bottles years back and are no longer available for newer products. The whole Botanical Kinetics product line is amazing.  I've used it off and on for a couple years, but have now recommitted to making it my daily routine.  I use the gel cleanser, exfoliant and hydrating lotion every night, and the really amazing thing about them is how quickly you see results.  After just a few days, someone complimented me and asked why my skin looked so bright and glow-y!  Yes, it's more expensive than drug store brands, but I've never gotten results and compliments with those and you use so little of this daily, it lasts forever. Love this product. My daughter is an esthetician and she uses this product on her clients. She also went to an Aveda school and has used this product every since she graduated. It works wonderful on my skin. Every time I try using another product I always come back to this one. This is a staple in my home and I will always use it. I usualy use amazon but for this item you can buy it for $49 dollars of the 16.9 oz or the 5 oz for $20 right from the store itself This is a great product and if Amazon actually publishes this review I encourage you to shop avedas own website, where the same product is $19.  It would be great if Amazon could carry this at a similar rate. As an Aveda enthusiast, I can only say this facial cleanser is what convinced me to try the other products I now use. This facial cleanser is gentle enough to use daily, and paired with a moisturizing or toning/moisturizing routine, it's downright addictive, you will LOVE how your skin feels! This product is great for keeping your hair shiny especially if you have to blow dry your hair.  You need just a little on your hands and rub over your hair.  It will last for months and your hair looks healthy."
B00CHHJOHE," love this simple way to cleanse face Very good product. Great for sensitive skin. Cleans well, leaves no residue behind. Highly recommend. This is a miracle product. When I first starting using it I was doubtful it would work. My daughter brought me back some from France. Well it works like nobody's business. I'v tried every brand now and I always go bak to Simple It works fantastic and is way less expensive than other brands.  Don't waste your money stick with this drugstore product Cant believe how much i love this. I'll go through a couple of makeup removing wipes until nothing is coming off, so i assume my face is clean. Then i put some of this on a cotton round and with one rub it is completely covered with foundation that i assumed was gone. This stuff is insane! So easy to truly clean your face. I'm hooked This wipes are my favorite by far. They are great for my sensitive skin, not too drying and remove all of my makeup. I use these after working out as well to refresh my face. Perfect for travel to avoid another 3 oz liquid to get through security at the airport.  I like this brand because it does not have any added scent or product. This is the only micellar water I've used, and I see no reason to change. It doesn't irritate my skin. It doesn't leave a film. I use it instead of water as a morning cleanser and my skin has improved since I started.Bonus: it's a reasonable price. You just can't beat Simple. This stuff is is purely amazing. A way better alternative to washing your face and feels even better too. I feel refreshed and clean after using it. Instantly gets off eye makeup. In love! The wipes are great too. Love the no-rinse aspect because I hate washing my face at night. Does not dry out skin! I am prone to cystic acne and this has kept it at bay by not stripping my skin. Removes even the toughest double-wear makeup. I use it with cotton pads or just a towel and it always removes everything. Love love love it Love love love this product!  I read about this in one of my women's magazines and it got great reviews so I was excited to try it. It removes even stubborn mascara without a trace of oiliness or tightness on my face. You simply get a great feeling of clean skin and no rinsing needed! I love this Micellar water. Cleans super easy and not harsh on your skin. I was using Garnier waterproof Micellar water and it left an oily feeling on your skin and it made me breakout horrible. This makes your skin feel soft and completely clean. I work in the yard everyday and come in and use cotton squares with this to clean my face off, and I do believe this works better than soap and water in a sink.  skin feels very clean when you're done using this, I was very surprised but delighted Has kept my 16 yr olds face from breaking out. Hes a soccer player, who incidentally is also Sweaty McSweatson. Between hormones, soccer practice and tinkering with his car i.e. oil and grease it has kept the acne from making him look like a greasy pizza I have extremely sensitive skin, and these are the only wipes I have used that don't leave my skin stinging painfully after wiping. Even the YesTo line for sensitive skin still stings for me. On top of that, these wipes remove even my waterproof mascara. I have jumped on the micellar water wagon, and I don't think I'm getting off any time soon. I have super sensitive skin with mild rocesa/dry skin and this product works great! No more stinging lotions!! I love this face wash!!! I've tried so many other ones and this is the best. It cleans without drying my skin. I use baby oil to remove eye make up, and this face wash will remove the baby oil afterwards without drying my skin. Definitely recommend it I love this face wash. I have sensitive acne prone skin along with rosacea and this doesn't cause any irritation whatsoever. I use this to remove any makeup before my black soap just to make sure that my face is clean before I go to bed.This cleanser is so gentle that I can open my eyes while the foam is on my face and I won't feel a thing yet I have tested its makeup removal power with a cotton swab right after and it leaves little to nothing behind. I use long wear makeup and primer sometimes so I always do the double wash but for others you probably won't need to. I hope they keep selling this. You can feel clean without any odor or harsh chemicals. Definitely feels good on oily skin, will leave skin bright and I recommend daily use. Awesome product for cleaning my face at night and refreshing in the morning.  It's not astringent but gently cleanses.  No chemical smell - in fact, not much smell at all.  I use it every day on my sensitive fair skin. This product is really great! It takes off all your makeup but I recommend using more than the advised 2-3 drops. I tend to have severely dry and sensitive skin all year long. I have tried countless amounts of products, which either reacted to my skin or didn't help my dry skin at all. This product nourishes my skin, leaving it very soft and smooth, with NO dryness. Best of all, no reaction to my overly sensitive skin. Finally!! This is my nightly routine keeper! I also use Simple Moisturizing Wash and Simple SPF 15 Moisturizer during the day. Simple make-up remover wipes and Simple Moisturizer Wash at night. I have really sensitive skin - like I can't use oil of Olay sensitive wipes, kind of sensitive skin. I have a friend who's a makeup artist and she told me to try them to remove my makeup. I was cautious and tested out on my arm first, no adverse reaction. I tried on my face and fell in love. No reaction, easy to use, got all my waterproof mascara off, even removed my tough Halloween makeup!! Love this cream, nice and light with no oily residue. Just wish my Wal-mart would start carrying it again. Not something you'd probably want shipped during the summer. I really Love this cleansing oil; my skin is semi-dry so really helps with dryness!  My face feels clean & refreshed after using it and it doesn't have an over powering aroma, just nice! Love this! Bought based on reviews and I have used for a month now. It takes off all my make up including mascara and leaves my face clean, hydrated and residue-free. And a little goes a long way. I will be reordering when the time comes! Love these! An  optometrist suggested I use Micellar wipes, especially for eye makeup removal because of my dry eyes. Absolutely wonderful! These do a great job of removing all makeup without leaving my face dry or greasy. I highly recommend them. Thin oil cleanser. Seems to get all my sunscreen/makeup off easily, and doesn't irritate my super-sensitive skin. I've had my bottle for almost 3 months now and I'm only about halfway through. Works like a charm. I suffer from dry skin during the summer so you can imagine what winter does to my skin. This was great for keeping my face moisturized despite the cold weather without feeling like I'm wearing a petroleum jelly mask. I noticed my skin has gotten clearer as well when used in conjunction with the Simple cleanser and makeup remover. I think I found the brand for me. This is my go-to moisturizer! I have very sensitive skin and this doesn't make me break out or too oily. I use it as both a night cream and a day cream under my foundation and powder. I have noticed that my face continues to get softer as I use it too. I have tried other moisturizers but always seem to come back to this one. I would really suggest this for someone who has a combination skin type or someone who is prone to breaking out. I have been searching for a long time for a skin care routine that will moisturize my skin without leaving my skin oily. This product does just that. The cream goes on lightly and instantly moisturizes and brightens the skins. I apply in the morning before makeup and at night before bed. I have noticed my face becoming smoother, with less breakouts, and a more even tone since I began using this produce. I have excited to try other products from this brand. Sinks into my skin and leaves it feeling moisturized without being oily or sticky, a miracle on my oily combination skin. I'm addicted. Just wish this came in a bigger size. Love these wipes. They are gentle on my sensitive rosacea skin but still leave it clean (without getting that squeaky tight feeling). - use daily on face- skin feels amazing- i personally call this magic water- love simple and simple brand items- i had acne prone skin- now use this to soothe and cleanse I can wash my face in the shower, then wipe it with a cleansing clothe, and still, this stuff find more makeup on my face! Your face isn't truly clean until you use this! I found this Cleansing Oil to be very, very effective to remove makeup and grime from face at the end of the day! When I cleanse with Simple Kind to Skin Oil, and next step with Simple Micellar Water, my skin feels soft and (if I do a cotton ball with witch hazel) clean!This product has become a part of my cleansing routine...easy and quick! I have never found a makeup remover that works as well as Micellar! It removes everything and leaves my skin soft, clean and nourished, and never dry feeling. I purchased this a few weeks ago and have been using it on my face every morning and evening. I've struggled with blackheads for over 10 years on my nose and nothing has worked (even prescriptions). For the first time in over a decade most of them are completely gone. I don't have to use foundation anymore because it has evened out my skin and I no longer have to use moisturizer on my cheeks because they used to get dried out and flaky. I highly recommend this! I was looking for a moisturizer that didn't have a heavy scent. This was perfect and I've been very pleased. It's not too heavy and I haven't had any trouble with it. Good, I like the feeling on my skin. It leaves a refreshed face and it is not aggressive or oily. I also use to clean my shaved head every evening and it does a good job.Overall, I am satisfied and I would recommend it. This stuff is great! i have sensitive skin and use this before shaving to get all the dry skin off my face. Wouldn't think of using any other brand! This is great stuff! Nice to use anytime, but good for a quick face cleaner or refresher before bed. Non-irritating and the price is right! Finally a cleanser for dry skin that is simple to use!  Use it every night.  Even run some through my hair.  Don't need night cream any more. This is the best makeup remover ever!!!!I have very sensitive skin that is easily irritated. Simple makeup remover does not irritate my face, and there is no harsh chemical smell. It feels refreshing, like I am simply cleansing my face with fresh cool water. It does a great job of removing all of my makeup. I usually have to do a follow up face wash after using make remover, with simple I don’t have to follow up with a facial cleanser. I've used the Simple facial wipes for about 4 years & I like them very much.When I use them consistently, I have no breakouts. This stuff is just dang cool.  I use it after washing my face to remove any final traces of eye makeup.  I had no idea I was leaving behind so much until this helped remove it.  No scent and not oily. These are great for removing makeup. They are soft and the scent is light and pleasant. I have no skin irritation from using. I have been reading about Micellar water products for a couple of years, and finally purchased these wipes to try.  I am currently working very long hours and the selling point for these wipes was that they weren't soap-based, and didn't require a toner after using. I keep them on my night stand and take my makeup off with them prior to going to bed. (I do not use them for removing mascara - I use another product for that.)The biggest point I want to share is that I have been using these wipes exclusively for makeup removal for a little more than two weeks. I have had a stubborn blackhead on my nose for a good 20 years that wouldn't budge, no matter how often I used exfoliating products, and I've invested a lot of money in high end exfoliators in an attempt to make that spot go away. It has grown larger over the years, and was a skincare peeve of mine. I noticed a couple of days ago that that blackhead is beginning to break down and get smaller.  I thought at first that I was imagining it, but that blackhead is honestly a good two-thirds gone.  This is just from using these wipes!  I would never have predicted that something this simple and quite soft and insubstantial as a disposable face wipe would have such effective results for blackhead breakdown, but they're doing the trick.  I have noticed smaller blackheads on my chin area are also melting away.  I predict that in another few weeks of use, my skin is going to be as close to blackhead-free as it is humanly possible to achieve. (For the record, I don't have a lot of blackheads - just a handful that have taken up residence over the years and refused to budge, getting larger with age.)These are safe for my sensitive skin, and have exfoliating benefits that I wouldn't ever have expected or predicted.  Full disclosure:  I do spend a good 3-5 minutes using a single wipe on my face, neck, and décolletage, scrubbing with the nubby side (there is a nubby, exfoliating side, and smooth side to each wipe) and using the whole cloth in sections until I have used it all. Finally, I also use it on the tops of my hands.  I definitely get my money's worth out of each wipe!  I wholeheartedly encourage people to try this product.  I now have it on Auto-Ship status, as I don't want to ever be without these wipes in my skincare arsenal. So nice for my super sensitive skin! I use Pond's dry skin cream when it's really dry, which is only a handful of months out of the year here, but need something lighter and still refreshing the rest of the year. This moisturizer cream does just that and doesn't cause any breakouts! Which is a big deal when your skin is as sensitive as mine. I picked up a tube of this at the local swap meet once and immediately got hooked. There is a companion facial wash that most people buy with this, but I prefer to use this as a stand alone product. I like the grain that the consistency of the scrub has. When you apply it to your face, you feel the exfoliation and instant gratification of clean, exfoliated skin. It is a good value on Amazon and I highly recommend this product. Gets my face clean and does not clog up pores or make me break out. I actually subscribe to get this delivered regularly. Love this cleanser. No crazy fragrance or ingredients. Gets all my makeup and oil off without over drying my skin. I love this wash.  It washes off makeup and rinses clean.  Doesn't irritate my sensitive acne prone skin either!! Life changing. I use this on a cotton ball every morning and it cleans my pores with a little bubbly feeling. Very hydrating and replenishing. Even for my oily pimple prone skin. Super gentle but effective makeup remover! It doesn't pull at my skin and leaves it feeling hydrated rather than dry and tight. I use these every day -- great for removing makeup (and this brand also makes great little ones with a different formula perfect for removing eye makeup, highly recommended), and for facial cleaning.  I rarely wash my face unless in the bath or shower, but I use these twice a day.  They seem to be very good for my skin.  I just use one, then follow with my skin care.  I've used a lot of other brands in facial cleansing wipes -- these are the best ones I've tried. Gets off everything except my waterproof mascara. Now I use coconut oil around my eyes first to remove the mascara and then this wipe to clean it off. Super simple and gentle.It takes me about two-three months to use an entire package of wipes and they never dry out. Love them! As a self described product junkie I can say I have used EVERY make up remover wipe and these are hands down the best. Remove makeup easily and quickly. I love this stuff. It really does clean all the makeup off your skin and leaves your face fresh and clean. I'm very fair so while I don't wear heavy foundation, I do slather on thick, zinc-oxide sunscreens which can be a chore to remove. I've used this for a week now (no breakouts whatsoever) and love how clean it leaves my skin. I particularly appreciate the dewy look I have when waking up; much better than the dry-yet-somehow-greasy-in-spots feeling I've gotten with standard washes. Full disclosure: the closer it gets to bedtime the lazier I am so the fact that is a one-and-done task means I'll actually stick with it and look forward to seeing how much gunk I can get off in one swipe. Great product, love being able to get 2 bottles. Have already repurchased, and will continue to as long as it's available. Really love this product.  Does a great job removing make up and it is gentle to the skin.  I always use it first to remove the bulk of my make up, then follow up with my regular cleanser and my skin feel REALLY clean without feeling stripped out. I can feel the difference when I just clean my face with my cleanser and don't use this product.  My face doesn't feel as clean.  I only use it to remove excess make up.  It gives your cleansing routing a boost, so to speak.  Would definitely buy it again. These are by far my favorite wipes. While I don't wear a ton of makeup, it is able to effectively remove what I do wear (foundation, blush, contour, eyeshadow, etc.). They are gentle on the skin, and don't leave my face feeling too dry after use. Unscented, doesn’t sting eyes, wipes makeup off with just a few swipes. Good product. Really great! Love this foam face wash. My skin feels so clean. Perfect for all skin types. Really makes a difference taking off makeup. Also with older skin, much less drying. The only thing that reliably removes my eyeliner without stinging my eyes! I just take a cotton ball, pour a little on it, and press it against my closed eye for a few second before wiping away. And it seriously wipes away all trace of my eyeliner! No more rubbing my eyelids red trying to get my make-up off! These wipes are great. No burning at all on irritating parts of the face either. Would recommend I purchased these on a clearance rack at a big WM-box chain store and was so floored by the amount of eye make-up removed in a couple of swipes. I immediately checked the price on Amazon and signed up for Subscribe and Save. I use them every day after work before I take my evening shower since plain soap and water does not adequately remove my make-up. They are worth a try. My previous wipe was Olay Regenerist but I will switch to this brand now. Was introduced to this product by a friend, I have very sensitive skin and it doesn't irritate me at all. Great for removing make up, or when your being lazy and don't feel like washing your face! The only makeup remover I will use. No stinging just great makeup removal I love micellar water - it has a great smell, is refreshing, and with one quick swipe you can wipe away all of the detritus of the day! Wow! This works so well! Love it and telling all my girlfriends about this amazing cleanser! got it for my 4yo niece, she had ruff dry skin on her face and this helped so much. My personal favorite! No oily residue, effective & very 'SIMPLE!' makes a noticeable difference in my appearance, does the job well This was another product I was recommended by the world of beauty and I was again very impressed. The wipes do exactly what they say they will but without the chemical additions other cleansers may have. All in all a great buy and very versatile and easy to transport and use. Leaves my face squeaky clean. Removes my makeup super well. Love the foaming texture. Makes it easy to spread on face.  I use it with my Clarisonic too.  I also use it to wash my make up sponges and brushes. I like the smell a lot and it’s a good exfoliating scrub I have been using this for a while. I use it at night to help me with my rosacea, and it does help a lot. Keep in mind that rosacea is complicated, and what works for one doesn't necessarily mean that will work for all. part of my daily routine in the morning and at night. my all time favorite micellar water! I have bought others in the past but I always go back to this one! This gets rid of a lot of dirt and oil and leaves my skin refreshed. I can be home all day and when I use this all over my face it still manages to pick up oil and dirt I didn't think I would have. I love this one so much I have 4 back ups because I use them constantly. And on amazon they sell it way cheaper than at any other store. Nice and light. Smells like sunscreen,  but lightly. I am in love with this makeup remover! It takes off all of my waterproof makeup without all the pulling that some other removers need. It does not sting or irritate my eyes at all. I used to use the neutrogena makeup remover wipes but those always left a residue on my skin that had to be washed off. With the cleansing water, I can wipe my skin down in the morning (after washing the night before) and continue with my makeup routine without having to go wash it off! I have this sent to my every month! Omg this product is amazing. It removes your makeup and leaves your skin refreshed at the same Very gentle and does not dry-out skin.  Excellent for sensitive skin. One of the best! Light weight feel- not greasy feeling I absolutely love this product. It is the only Micellar water I use. I have very sensitive, combination skin and I find that this doesn't dry me out or make my nose more oily. I use it as the last step in my make-up removal process and after one pass, my skin feels lighter and squeaky clean. Definitely recommend! Gentle and effective micellar water! Leaves my skin feeling clean and hydrated, not stripped. New favorite. A great facial wipe!  I starting buying these last year,  based on a YouTube Beauty Guru's recommendation.  They are gentle enough for sensitive skin, but still get my makeup off easily.  Love them! amazing -- a little goes a VERY long way This is my first time using subscribe and save with my Prime membership and it was lovely! This is my favorite face wash but many times the store is out of stock, NOT AMAZON. What a great way to save time and frustration. I'm in LOVE with this foam cleanser. It's smooth, a little goes a long way and your face feels squeaky clean. I've struggled with my complexion as long as I can remember, trying endless cleanser options. Now I use no facewash at all, just rinse with water then use micellar water, morning and night. My face has never been so clear. Simple is the only brand I have tried. When I do wear eye makeup, I prefer to use coconut oil to remove it. If you don't depend on micellar water to remove makeup, you probably won't be disappointed. No scent, and cleans off my makeup super fast! I love this stuff.  I have very sensitive skin, breaks out with everything.  These wipes remove all the makeup.  I follow with a wash with my regular cleanser and moisturizer.  Skin looks clean a smooth.  Before I used these wipes even washing with my regular cleanser, some makeup residue was left and I'd experience intermittent breakouts.  Since using these wipes no breakouts at all. I LOVE it!! better than any of the $100 creams that I've ever used. I'm a natural blonde, with fair/red skin  that is extremely sensitive. Zero breakouts with great hydration. I do use the hydration serum from SIMPLE along with this too. I go to the gym on my lunch break, and I needed to start taking my make up off after working out. I don't like make up removing wipes because they leave a film or smell behind that really bothers me. I bought a bottle of this stuff and I love it! I follow the directions exactly, and it takes off all my make up without drying my skin. There is no scent, and it doesn't leave behind any film or tackiness to the skin. Will repurchase! Try it and you'll love it. If not, you should!I thought if was another astringent or toner, and ignored it, until I got a sample. It's really neat!You put it on a cotton pad, and wipe it on your face, and it cleans your skin. But, it doesn't sting like alcohol and you don't have to rinse it off like soap. It looks and feels like water, but picks up stuff your regular cleanser didn't get. Or, people use it instead of their cleansers.It's water with micelles in it, and something something science science they have magical chemistry tails that grab gunk out of your pores. Apparently it comes from France, but don't feel intimidated, I have seen no evidence of it being snooty or condescending to my other cosmetic products. It's very much a team player.I use it after Noxzema on days that I wear makeup. It does a great job clearing up anything I missed the first time over. It doesn't sting my eyes, which makes it way easier to remove eye makeup with than playing chicken with the world's most tingly and refreshing cream cleanser!In the mornings, or nights of no-makeup days, I often just use a few cotton pads and the micellar water.It doesn't dry your skin, and I have noticed that if I'm extra-greasy it's not always enough on its own.But, really, it's miraculous other than that. Gentle on my skin and it doesnt leave my skin as oily as other make up wipe removers Always happy with these! I recently purchased this after reading an article about it and how wonderful it is. I have horrible blackheads on my nose.  I have been using this for a little under a week and have noticed they are less of them. That alone makes this worth the money  to me. My face feels very clean and slightly cool after I use this. I will buy this again once it is gone. Love it!  I was scared at first to try oil cleansers since I have extremely oily skin, but this stuff is great!  After trying a few different brands of oil cleanser, this is my go to. Gentle, effective, and doesn't sting my eyes. A must for your skincare routine! This really is a simple face cleanser.  I use it to wipe off makeup and then follow up with a face wash.  But there has definitely been days when I'm too lazy to wash afterwards and just use cotton pads to wipe off my makeup.  I haven't noticed any ill effects from this.  I love how gentle it is on my sensitive skin as well.Usually two square pads drizzled withe the SW is enough to remove all of my makeup, mascara, brows, full coverage foundation. The best micelles water of all as far as I am concerned best thing to use to remove eye makeup! Love this, just as described and worked well on my skin. I have trouble with dry skin every winter and have really been challenged to find a cream that solved the dry skin without causing acne on my chin and around my nose. This has been great. I have used the past couple weeks with No outbreaks! It is the first product I have found to work for me after 3 winters of trial and mostly error. This product is wonderful! I have horribly dry skin on my face and it got worse over the summer. I decided to try this and I'm so glad I did. This is wonderful! So natural and clean feeling. I have very sensitive skin and it works great! (it does not take off eye liner or mascara so i use something else for that) Nice, natural feel. The cream works very well. It does not leave a greasy feeling. Smells good. I prefer using cleansing oils or butters for taking the make-up off and this one does the job. It's definitely better than just using basic grapeseed oil. It took off all my make-up, even very resistant mascara and liner. I put a few drops in my palms, rub my face very well (but gentle), insist a little on the eyes, than wash-out with water.  I use more than the recommended 2-3 drops. I had no issue with dispensing product from the bottle.The skin does not get oily at all afterwards. I have combination skin and in my dry days I really feel the need of extra moisture after using this.I have very sensitive eyes and this does not cause any issues. Did not cause any breakouts either. Probably the best affordable cleansing oil I have found on the market. Sadly I can’t find this in my drugstores anymore. It doesn’t break me out and doesn’t burn my eyes like some other ones I have tried! My skin feel so soft Ordered that for my beautiful wife and she is happy with this scrub, it is exactly what she looked for. A great product at a fair price. My face is so happy I don't have to rub makeup off anymore! I do really enjoy this micellar water for removing makeup before washing my face. I would not use this as the only method of cleansing the skin if you were wearing makeup/spf. However, it would be sufficient for when you wake up in the morning. It is not great at removing makeup and eyeliner though. For that, I still prefer the Neutrogena eye makeup remover. I only recently started using this, but so far is has been kind to my fair skin and it removes so much make up and dirt. I've used disposable make up clothes, followed by toner to clean my face at night forever. I used this before the toner and it took off more dirt, that I didn't realize was still there. It does feel like it's just water but there's definitely cleaning stuff in there. Love this face wash. Most cleansers dry out my skin, this removes makeup well and leaves my skin moisturized and super soft. I love this stuff! It's the lazy girl makeup remover. I wanted a product that I could use to remove face and eye makeup with, that would be relatively neutral so I could proceed to the rest of my nightly skincare routine without having to use toners and other between steps. It seems to get used up very quickly since it has a water-like consistency and a lot comes out of the bottle at once. Fortunately, it's pretty cheap. :) I've been using this stuff for about a year and I refuse to use anything else. It's rich without being oily, it absorbs quickly, and it doesn't have a bunch of nasty additives/chemicals like so many other products. Plus, the price is great. Excellent product I love this cleanser. I have acne prone sensitive skin. This cleanser is strong enough to remove all traces of make up but does not dry out my skin at all. In fact it feels ""balanced"" and looks very healthy.I use to use Cetaphil for years , but due to the price increases where I live I have been searching for something a bit more affordable but just as good. I will stick to the Simple cleansers. I think they are fantastic. Does a great job of removing makeup. Ideal for sensitive skin. This provides nice moisture and light SPF without feeling oily, smelling like screen, or making my face breakout. Perfect! One bottle lasts a long time. This product came highly recommended from a celebrity make up artist I am working with. I love everything about it. My skin feels squeaky clean and no tugging of skin needed. Fast delivery, obviously brand new items, and the product inside is exactly the same as the ones I've bought at the store. My last bottle lasted me over 6 months, so these 2 bottles alone will definitely cover me for over a year. Love this product My whole family uses this!! This stuff is great!! Really gets ALL the dirt and makeup off of your face Use this everyday!  Keeps my crappy complexion in check. I use my cleansing water as a gentle makeup remover. Other makeup removers in the past have dried out my skin or made it very tight and shiny. Simple cleansing water leaves my face feeling cool, refreshed, and soft. It is very gentle around the eyes and works well at removing waterproof mascara and liquid eyeliner. I apply at night before bed and wake with hydrated smooth skin. Scent free and very gentle! I have pretty tricky skin.  Sensitive and prone to breakouts when I use the wrong products yet also cursed with eczema.  Yet, this cleanser has worked very well for me.  It doesn't dry out my skin and also doesn't leave a residue behind (provided that you rinse well).  I pair it with a Konjac sponge to get a gentle scrubbing/exfoliation, and it has helped my skin quite a bit. The most moisturizing of the simple facial washes. Love using it. No breakouts at all. This cleanser is lovely; I only use it in the morning to take off my night cream, etc.  And since I am an avid Retin-A user, it is suggested that I stay away from foaming facial cleansers, as they can strip away the moisture barrier.  Not good for older complexions!  At night, I use Eucerin Calming Facial Cleanser, which is gentle, and works well to remove makeup without stripping away the oils we need in the skin. Product was delivered as promised and is exactly like we purchase retail I've been looking for a good facial moisturizer for a long time now and this one finally has done the job. It doesn't make me break out, doesn't make my face red or greasy looking, and still leaves me feeling hydrated. I'm on my third bottle now and could not be more pleased. Thank you Simple! Love the product! Just as described!Doesn't work if you have makeup on It cleanses off very cleanly, leaving no residue on my face. One of my basics. It takes off all the makeup at night, but I do need to massage it into my eyes a bit to truly take off all mascara. Will repurchase again and again -- I am on my second bottle right now! This is a great, gentle cleanser. When I use heavy makeup, I use it after my normal cleanser to get my face even cleaner. I also use it as a toner sometimes and as the sole cleanser at other times, just depending on how dirty my face is. Its very gentle, though, and also effective at removing make-up. I love that it has so many uses but its always gentle. LOVE. Takes all makeup off easily, even stubborn mascara and tough liquid liner. I have purchased this product twice now so I obviously love it. Great for cleaning face after exercise/yard work or before bed. It is amazing (scary) how much dirt and grime this lifts off my face. Also, it does not leave my face feeling dry as some cleaners do. Finally it is very gentle and does not aggregate your skin. Love, love, love this find! This is the best thing that has happened to me since nutella.I have ultra super duper sensitive skin and this just saved me. I only use oil (if I have really waterproof mascara or something) or this. Oil sometimes feels gross so its nice to have something like this thats easy and feels refreshing.Also I feel like this makes my skin better, less red and less irritated. Love this facial scrub! I use it a few times a week to exfoliate and it always leaves my skin feeling smooth. I feel this cleaner is great at removing makeup. I use this every night. This is the only face wash I want to use now. I have oily / combination skin with Rosacea. This scrub is gently enough to use every day without irritating my sensitive skin yet leaves my skin feeling really clean. No residue or dryness. Love it! This stuff is perfect.  I am a big fan! Absolutely love! I have normal dry skin. I live in New York so the weather greatly affects my skin. I find it works better if I apply it on top of a wet wipe rather than cotton pads. Still leaves it clean, it's just less drying. Now I get way more compliments about my skin. My fav moisturizer came very quickly. I love this product! My favorite facial scrub. Usually will use every other day after a cleanser. Not too rough. Just use with water and rinse. This is hands down the best make up remover. I use it for face and eyes. It is a great first step and removes all my foundation, concealer, longwear eyeliner and lipstick as well as mascara. I don't need a separate eye make up remover, just hold the cotton pad on the eyelid for 15-30 seconds and even longwear liner comes off. I used this when lived in U.K. And was just over the moon when it arrived in US!  Best EVER cleansing product for my extra sensitive skin, lifts dirt and make up amazingly! The toner is also wonderful and refreshing, never had a single pimple when using this product! SIMPLEy the Best!! Great cleanser! Makes skin feel soft! Love it! What do they put in this? It takes off my eye makeup without any greasy residue. Actually, I'll wash my face, and then use this on a cotton pad to wipe anything that's left off. It's not harsh or oily. I can't live without it and I'm glad they have a larger size now. Awesome cleansing water! Gentle and doesn't dry out or sting. Totally impressed by all of the products in this line. This cleanser is amazing and so luxurious, and for the price, what more could you ask for? I really liked all the simple products I bought the facial wipes are gentle and leaves my skin feeling clean. The facial scrub has just enough grainy substance to get rid of the dead skin cells. The simple roll on is cooling and feels wonderful on a hot day. The simple cleanser liquid is just perfect it gets my skin clean. Just as described and I would buy it again.  Simple and great. This is the best moisturizer I've ever used.  I used to use Olay until I came upon this.  This is so much more reasonably priced, and works just as well if not better than the Olay! I love this product! It takes all but the most waterproof makeup off, and it doesn't leave my skin oily or need rinsing (I dry my skin afterwards but you would probably also be fine just letting it dry). So glad it's on normal prime now rather than prime pantry! Does not leave a sticky film like neutragena wipes, definitely more gentle on the skin I love this moisturizer because it has SPF plus it's very light on my sensitive skin. So far so good but my dermatologist doesn't recommend it for oily or acene prone skin. I'm still gonna use it until i'm sure it breaks me out. My kids hate hate hate the stickiness on their face from the common name sunblock...  And I am happy I finally find this one they are willing to use on a daily basis! My favorite face wash. It doesn't leave my skin feeeling dried out but works well getting my makeup off at the end of the day. I love this foaming cleanser! This is all I use now!I was skeptical about trying something called 'cleansing water'. However, I figured I would dive in and just go for it. I've been using it 2x a day and my face has been clean and hasn't broken out at all (which always happens to me when I change cleansing products.) I have very sensitive skin, so I've been trying to find the most sensitive cleansing solution possible. I believe I've found it.I follow it up with a hyaluronic acid around my eyes and then a face oil all over, as my skin isn't just sensitive but it's lizard-like as well.Give it a try! You'll love it. Love this cleanser. One puff is more than enough to thoroughly cleanse my face. It does nor irritate or dry out my very sensitive skin. The foam is instant to use & much easier to rinse off. I just love this foaming cleanser. It has a great dispenser so it's easy to get the right amount of cleanser. When it comes in touch with water is foams very well. You can really get a great lather and it's easy to divide it over your face. I like to use it with my facial brush in the morning. It really cleans my face without irritating it. My skin doesn't feel dry afterwards but fresh and clean. Very gentle and soothing on the skin as advertised and cleans well. This stuff is great. Its the most absolute mildest cleanser I've ever used and I'm obsessed with it and I use it every morning just to refresh and every night for makeup removal or to clean after washing the face before lotion. There is no odor, its fragrance free and my skin is very sensitive and LOVES it Works like a charm to remove stubborn eye make-up and does not leave any residue or sting.  All you have to do is squeeze some onto a cotton pad (do not use cotton balls as you will have cotton residue all over your eyelashes) and hold the pad onto each eye for less than a minute maybe a minute or more for stubborn waterproof makeup.  Love this product! Just based on the ingredients this is way better than any other micellar water like Garnier and loreal, which both have alcohol. This one has no alcohol and has lots of extra moisturizing ingredients like niamiacine and glycerin. Love it! Love this!! My daughters ache has cleared up!! She tried everything including prescription medicine, diet changes etc.. It has been a miracle in a bottle for her. I like it for myself as well. After using, I sometimes skip my moisturizer because my skin feels great and really doesn't need it. This is the only face moisturizer that I have ever used that doesn't make me break out more. I have very sensitive skin that is made worse by a medication. I use it during the day before applying any make-up. It absorbs quickly and cleanly. I don't use it at night because honestly the only thing that has ever been effective at night is literally rubbing a banana peel on my face and leaving the juice or whatever on overnight. Seriously, look it up. But for my daytime moisturizer, this is the one. A few people that I know also use this and love it. How did we live without micellar water? I've tried several varieties and you can't beat Simple for price. Fabulous! Inexpensive, scrubby, very light scent. Really gentle on my face, removes make-up really well. I love this product because it's cheap and doesn't leave my face feeling dry or oily. I do use a face cleanser after using this product to take my makeup off though. Definitely would recommend! Works really well. I have very sensitive, very dry skin and this is able to remove all the dirt without irritating my skin. I usually use a face cleanser as well though. I'm lazy, so I sometimes get tempted not to remove my makeup at night. However, every time I start to think it'll be ok, my mom's dire warnings about what would happen if I didn't take off my makeup spring to my mind, and I ultimately make at least an attempt to remove it. Usually when I'm tired/lazy, that means using a makeup remover wipe - but they get expensive, and can be harsh on my skin. I also never seem to get everything off with them. So, I typically make every attempt to wash my face properly and use good eye makeup remover to ensure that everything comes off - well, at least I did until I read about Micellar Water recently. I immediately ordered Simple's on Amazon (it was the most reasonably priced one I could find,) and tried it out. I have to use 2 cotton balls to get all my makeup off, but the Micellar Water makes my skin feel as clean as it does with proper washing, and more moisturized. I read reviews that you can't use it on your eyes, but the directions just say to gently wipe around closed eyes -  so I took that to mean i could use it on my eyes as long as they were closed & I was careful. So far I haven't experienced any irritation, and it does a great job of removing my eye makeup - even waterproof mascara. This new routine requires an extra step than using a makeup remover wipe would, but it's still quicker and easier than a full wash - while giving me almost better results. I don't know how this compares to ""traditional"" European Micellar Waters, but so far it's performed completely as advertised for me, and I'm very happy I tried it. I was very happy to find this cleanser on Amazon. I checked several stores near me and none of them had it. I'm wondering if it's being fazed out. The cleanser is very light and gentle on my sensitive skin. I've been using it for several years and never had an issue. Removes every trace of makeup. I use these when Im too lazy to use the liquid version and a pad. They are the perfect size and saturation of product and they give my face a nice clean feeling. It also removes my makeup really well with just one wipe. After experiencing some issues with another brand, I made the switch to this brand of micellar water. I have really strange dry/oily combination skin, so finding something that will work for me is usually a bit of a challenge. I was pointed to this brand by a beauty guru on YouTube, and other, non-guru people have said it works best for them.This hasn't made me break out. If anything, using it with a nice toner and following it all up with some face cream has made my skin as soft as it's been in awhile. I convinced my husband to try it, because I had an extra bottle - he's got really oily skin that is super prone to breakouts, and while he's tried everything, he humored me and tried it. I know how much he's tried (the number of people that suggested Proactiv or Cerave or whatever is just ridiculous and irritates him), so I usually don't bother suggesting stuff to him, but when I noticed how much more my skin was behaving, I figured it was worth a shot, especially if gurus with skin oilier than mine seemed to like it. It isn't 100% ""this fixed my skin!!"" for him, but it certainly reduced the number of breakouts. He verified that when he traveled out of town and didn't take it with him; his skin appeared to get worse without the micellar water, so he's asked me to order extra when he starts to run low. I'm sure his face could benefit from something in addition to it, but I was already pushing it when I suggested the micellar water, so I won't continue pushing unless he asks for more skin advice. ;)My skin can be sensitive at times, and this hasn't caused anything to flare up. I really do love and recommend this product; my skin has felt so much more balanced since I started a routine that used this, my favorite toner, and face cream. It even helps remove some waterproof mascaras, as long as you sort of wet the cotton pad with it and hold the pad on your eye for a few seconds. I plan to keep using this as long as I can. I just hope they carry it when we move out of the country for a couple of years. This product works really well.  I've tried some other Simple products that I didn't like very much, but this is an affordable cleanser that does what it says at a much cheaper price than other brands that do the same thing!  I use it to take off eye makeup and to make sure there are no more traces of makeup after I've washed my face.  I will definitely repurchase! This is a miracle product! Very gentle and perfect to use in a pinch when there is no water available. I come across this situation alot being s MUA, so it always comes in handy! Or even on a lazy night when you don't feel like taking the time to wash your face. It also takes off makeup beautifully! I will be buying more again soon. am obsessed w these wipes a fantastic light cream for day or night.  I like to alternate skin products and I use this one when I want my skin to just have a break from all the serums and masks.  It is soothing and nourishing. I love this product. In drought stricken California i do not have to turn on the water in order to feel that my face is getting cleaned. I put it on cotton pads and wipe my face until the cotton pads are not dirty looking, it takes about 3 pads. And my skin is not dry or oily, but feels very smooth and does not have any negative reaction. Now i want to clean my face 2 times a day. Love this Cream I really love this stuff. It cleans well and doesn't irritate my skin. No fragrance. I seem to be running through it a little fast though. I'm considering the Garnier water because it's similar priced and double the size. These have become my favorite face wipes. I'm lazy, so washing my face properly in the evenings just doesn't happen sometimes. I keep these by my bed and wipe off all the day's grime. My skin has improved a lot since I started using these over the olay brand, which made me break out. I love this product.  I am sooo lazy about washing my face, especially in the winter and this has made my getting ready for bed routine so much better!  I feel as though it works really well at removing dirt and makeup up and is extremely gentle on my skin.  No breakouts or issues at all.  Great product..I will probably use this for a long time. Really cleans well and gets more dirt off even after I have already washed my face with facial soap and water.  I think my skin had to get a little used to it, had a couple of pimples at first, but no problem now.  I really like it and it does not cause any problems for my sensitive skin. Provides deep cleansing without sting or dryness This is a gentle but effective cleanser that removes all remaining traces of makeup (I use after I have used a Simple make up remover wipes) and leaves my skin clean without drying it out. I love taking off my makeup with this stuff. These are the BEST makeup remover wipes! They get the job done without irritating my skin or eyes. I just love these things. I reordered the other day because they're a great way to clean my face thoroughly and quickly. They take all my makeup off and they are so gentle. They're a great started to my routine or they're a great way for me to do a quick job of my routine if I'm exhausted. These are wonderful. Convenient, great for late nights. I keep them by my bed for those nights I forget to wash my face before curling up. These don't make me break out, and even the sensitive skin wipes make me break out. I finally found a face cream that works!!! This stuff is unbelievable. A little goes a long way. You wont be disappointed, I have very sensitive skin and couldn't be happier with this product. Great to use after a day in the sun (with lots of sunblock on).  It's also great to use after removing my makeup that often has glitter or shimmer to it when I'm too lazy to scrub my face to try and get it all off.  Gentle on skin even for people like me who tend to have skin irritation to many products. Removes makeup SO easily with no scent, no residue....use on a cotton pad and makeup melts off.  Sometime after I wash my face I use this and the amount of makeup that comes off AFTER washing is very surprising!  When I'm lazy I do this instead of washing and I end up feeling cleaner.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! Very gentle cleanser. I use this on a cotton round to remove my waterproof eye makeup. Removes it like a charm with no harsh chemicals or rubbing. Highly recommend!  This is the best product for people like me with very sensitive skin.  Can't find anywhere but Amazon now and I sure hope they continue to carry it.  Love it - only product I'll ever use. After using their cleansing water & wipes I thought I'd give this product a chance. Not impressed.It isn't bad but it isn't really terrific either.I thought it would be thick & rich like some reviewers suggested, but it really isn't. It goes on very nice with a clean finish, but there's no way I would believe it would keep your skin moist for up to 24 hours.Good idea to use it twice a day like the jar indicates. Maybe even more so if you're prone to dry skin like mine. Better yet, get something that really does provide a lot of good old fashioned moisturizing.UPDATEAfter using this cream well beyond my initial review I must say I've become more of a fan.My initial thoughts about its lightweight content hasn't changed, however, the more I've used it (daily) the more I've noticed that my skin has a really nice, smooth feeling to it. Of course I have to apply a bit more due to age & dryness, but I am enjoying the results.Using this after my beloved Simple Micellar wipes has honestly made quite a noticeable difference. So much so that I just bought another jar.And while it would seem that getting a jar of this cream & a package of wipes every 30 days can appear expensive - It Is Not!Between the cost of these two products I am spending less than 20 bucks a month for clean, smooth, healthier looking skin. Try saying that when you leave the high end cosmetics counter! Doesn't irritate my skin, no fragrance (which I need for my sensitive skin) and works great for lazy nights when I don't want to wash my face, or for removing water soluble make up. I would buy it again I love this foam cleaner. It washes out all my make up with ease and super gentle on my skin. Best makeup remover wipes that I've tried. These remove all of my makeup. All of it! Even heavy Halloween makeup! They are sturdy and very moist. They leave my face feeling soft and hydrated. I will definitely purchase these again. I have INCREDIBLY sensitive and acne prone skin. Not only has my skin cleared tremendously since switching from benzoyl peroxide and salcylic acid cleansers, my skin is far less oily and red. I love how clean but not stripped my skin feels after  washing. Very nice and clean feeling.  Do not spend an arm and a leg on Micellar Cleansing Water this product is very affordable and doesn't aggravate my sensitive, rosacea prone skin."
B01L84AF5Q," I'm loving this face wash. I have dry skin and it works well for me. I also thought for the price, it's a really high quality product. So glad I bought this, it's already making a huge difference! Great foam cleanser! Leaves my face feeling super clean. I really love this cleanser!  It smells great and makes my face feel clean but not dry as some of them do.  I will definitely purchase this cleanser again! I love this facewash!!! My face always looks fresh and feels clean. My skin has been pretty clear too.  I do have sensitive skin, but the facewash doesnt effect it in any way, but my face is usually dry after I step out of the shower. This could be due to the face wash, sensitive skin, or our water supply; nothing a little moisturizer cant fix. Love the smell of this product!!!! I get compliments often about how clear my skin looks.  ♡♡♡♡ I love this cleanser!  First it smells amazing but second as you start to wash your face it literally feels like you are washing your face with a piece of velvet.  It feels absolutely amazing on your skin yet somehow gives you the most amazing results.  My skin feels clean without feeling stripped or dry.  I always follow up with the Skincare by Alana moisture boost serum and vitamin c moisturizer.  My skin has never looked or felt better Light, refreshing, and smells great - just in time for fall. Just need a few pumps and it washes away all the dirt and grim from the day. Doesn't dry out or irritate my skin like some other cleansers do. This is a fantastic product. My routine in the evenings is This pumpkin Clenser, the Hyaluronic Moisture Boost Serum, and the Daily Vitamin C Moisturizer. The combo is fantastic. I put a couple pumps on my face brush, and rinse off the day. I wear an average amount of makeup every day, and it cuts though all of it. The smell of this foaming cleaner is AMAZING! I love using it in the morning to start my day off. I feel energized and refreshed. My skin feels clean and soft. Excellent product. Love how fresh it leaves my skin feeling. Smells great too. Highly recommended. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Love it! This smells really nice and reminds me of the fall. Foams up nicely and leaves my skin feeling hydrated. First of all, the smell of this foaming pumpkin cleanser is AMAZING. It smells like a pumpkin spice latte. The feel on my skin is great, it's a nice lightweight daily cleanser. Can't wait to use this again and again. Love this cleanser.  The foam makes it feel light and clean.  And the scent is perfect for Fall.I've been using it along with the Alana Mitchell serum and moisturizer, and love the effects.  Smoother, cleaner skin. I want to eat this stuff, it smells that good. Works really well without drying out my sensitive skin. Really love this product so far. The pumpkin scent is great.  Lightweight foaming cleanser that is super gentle. My skin is happy! I have used many different cleansers and this one is my favorite. It cleans gently and melts away makeup at the end of the day. In the morning, it prepares the face for the remaining skin care regimen. I love how it smells, and it leaves the skin feeling clean without feeling stripped. This will definitely be the cleanser I use from now on. Love it! Product smells great and leaves my skin feeling great and not dry fragrance is amazing, love the foam-- it feels so light and beautiful to apply. Cuts through all my makeup, too This cleanser is so nice  It cleans but doesn't strip the skin of moisture - the fragrance is wonderful.  Will definitely purchase again, This smells amazing! Really really like this product. - Brynne This cleanser does not dry out my skin. It feels soft. I love the pumpkin scent, too. Amazing product, I love it! Excellent facial product.  Love the smell and not too oily or greasy like some others I have tried. Also great for travel as it has the protective lid."
B000VF5WVG," Perfect everyday cleanser Very gentle Would order again! I love this product a must have always thankyou I've used this product for about 8 years. It's the only moisturizer that has cleared up my adult acne. My teenager uses it also. I use it as a cleanser and apply on my face in the evening and wipe it off with a cotton pad. Then after washing my face in the morning I apply as a moisturizer. My skin has never looked better. Really. I have been using Premier Dead Sea products on and off for the past 3 years and it rivals many of the top moisturizers in the business. I love the creamy texture of the cream and when you apply it to your skin you can instantly feel it hydrating. Due to economic struggles I have had to use other store brand names to clean my face, which resulted in my face being dry, dull, and lackluster. Since using the creams, toner, and moisturizers for the past 15 days many people have complemented that they have seen a glow in my face.  I was very surprised to find the product in Amazon and at a reasonable price. At my local mall this cream along with the other products was $30.00 each! I am so glad and fortunate that I can now buy and enjoy high quality affordable face creams here at Amazon. THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING; I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR A LONG TIME; I HAVE A VERY SENSITIVE SKIN AND WORKS PERFECTLY Love it, cleans all the make up and leave a soft beautiful skin Nothing has cleaned my skin or made it feel as soft as this cleanser! Everything seemed to dry my skin out, but this cleanser hydrates and cleans better than anything else I have tried! Highly recommend! Love this product. Now that I am approaching 50, I wanted a cleanser that left my face feeling moisturized and clean. I was impressed with how clean this left my skin. I used a toner afterwards just to make sure all the dirt and makeup was gone! It was and my face feels soft!  This is a home run for me! So smooth and really does the job, very clean after feeling. All you need is a small pump and that is sufficient for the full face and neck. I love this cleanser. I've been using it for about 5 years and have only good things to say about it. It only takes a small amount to clean my face so the bottle lasts a long time. I love this cleanser. It is gentle on my skin, yet it removes all my make-up including mascara. I highly recommend it. I have been using this cleanser for YEARS and it's one of the best cleansers for me.  The creaminess of it makes my skin feel soft and moisturized as well as cleansed.  It's definitely a five star for me. Excellent cleanser. Removes face and eye makeup. I love this product.It does a great job of removing make up and leave your face very soft.I get excellent price through amazon. I absolutely love this cleanser. I love all of the Premier Dead Sea producst.  The Milk Cleanser is great for daily cleansing and for taking off eye makeup. Leaves your skin soft and moist.I originally bought this product from one of those kiosks in an upscale mall.  I paid a small fortune for it along with some other Premier Dead Sea products but I loved them all and they lasted a long time.  When I ran out of the Milk Cleanser, I checked Amazon to see if they carried the product and they did at a better price. This is great for dry skin and a a fraction of the cost than I originally paid for it. excellent service - very responsive - great product This cleanser is the best I have ever used in my life. It smells fabulous and makes my skin feel clean, refreshed and so smoothe. I have been using this product (along with the eye serum) for about four years and will never use anything different. They named this produst correctly as it is the first product that I can't live without using daily. I have used this product for a year now, and I love it. Works very well at removing the makeup that's left behind, I like the feeling of going to bed knowing I wont wake up with black eyes in the morning. I dont use it for much else tho. I originally purchased this product at a kiosk in the mall. VERY EXPENSIVE! I just happened to find this on line and ordered it thinking it could not possibly be the same. Well it was so I will be buying it this way from now on. Great product, great price! So much easier to have it delivered to my home rather than fight the parking and people at the mall. I use it as a cleanser in the morning and at night. It's the only cleanser I've used on my face for over three years now! So gentle and moisturizing on my 46-year-old face! :) Creamy, non-drying, and removes every last trace of makeup. Love it! There is no better make up remover! It is eficiente and hidrate my skin! I use It for 10 years! Love it I used to buy this cleanser from a booth in my local mall.  I have very dry and sensitive skin.  This stuff leaves my skin feeling clean but moist as well.  My order came all the way from Israel.  Thank goodness for our global economy! Great product perfect for gentle cleansing of my dry skin-- wonderful product! Great shipping, love product! Use this product daily! This cleanser is fantastic on my skin. I highly recommend it. Very gentle on the skin, yet throughly cleans. My friend has been using this for several years now.

Have been using it for 3 years. Received product earlier than expected and I love this product.  No problems of ay kind. As always, the most soothing, creamy cleanser ever! I am on my second bottle of the Milk Cleanser. The creamy formula does a great job of removing my makeup and leaves my face very soft. It has a nice soft scent too.  My only issue with the product is that the plastic bottle tends to tip over from time to time. Love this product. I have purchased it many times. And will continue to purchase it. I highly recommend it to others. Thank you for such a quick service on the Premier Milk Cleanser.  I have used this product for two or three years now with amazing results.

My sister recommended it to me a year ago and I've been buyingit ever since. It leaves my skin clean and soft. I love this product! I love Premier products good This stuff makes my wife's skin so smooth and soft!  We love it!  I will continue to buy it as long as it is available! Got  it I highly recommend this store and the product is awesome ....more power to your store.  I surely will buy from this store again This is the only cleanser I use to take makeup off. I have been using this cleaner for the past four years and absolutely love it.I have dried skin. When I use this to take off my make up my skin feels so soft and smooth afterwards. Also very important it not only removes all of the makeup but does not leave and trace of amounts of make up way use properly.I use this and two other products by Dead Sea Premier. If you have dry skin I recommend using this product line. I found this product in a mall at a kiosk.  I paid considerably more than what I pay through Amazon.com.  I love this product and was skeptical it was the same product at Amazon.  As far as I can tell it is exactly the same product.  It moisturizes my skin and smells heavenly. I really love this product. This is my favourite thing from Premier. All you do is smear a layer of it on your face and wipe it off with a towel. It removes all dirt and makeup from you face. The reason I know this works is because I use a cotton ball saturated with toner afterward and the cotton ball reveals to be cleaner than when I was my face with water. The person that said it doesn't feel clean, obviously didn't check to see if her skin actually was clean.The real reason I love this is because it only takes like 2 minutes and I don't have to use water. I hate washing my face before bed, usually I just skip the whole thing. If I wear eye makeup, I'll just rinse my eyes with water, but not actually wash my face. I know it's not good to sleep with makeup on and that it ages the skin, but I just hate it. I'm glad I found something so simple and easy to solve my problem. If I could, I would buy a life time supply of this so I'll never have to be without. Love it Best face cleanser on the market. Me, cosmetics/cleaning products consumer.  Of all the facial cleansers I have used over time, Premier Dead Sea is the Best.  Cleans without stripping.  Face feels soft and clean.  I smooth it on, work it in with my fingers; wet with a little water, massage; rinse off with wet washcloth.  Found it years ago in a mall kiosk.  Have been scraping every last bit of my bottle, stored upside-down.  It's a staple.  Junkie that I am, I've tried many other products, but am always happy to re-discover it on my counter.  I'm so pleased that Amazon has it! I originally bought this item at the mall off 1 of their little carts. BIG MISTAKE! VERY PRICEY! The product was amazing though. My sKin never looked or felt better. It was time to get a new bottle and I found amazon, Thank God! It allowed me to buy 7of their products for 1/2of what I had paid at that cart. They are all eqaually amazing. I HIGHLY recomend the dead sea products to everyone, all skin types, young and old. I am 38, but have brown spots from tanning, wrinkling on my upper chest, starting wrinkles around my eyes, larger pores on my cheeks. There is nothing this stuff can't fix. Try it, you'll love it. The emulsion I put on at night and still feel smooth and moisurized in the morning. Very subtle nice clean smell too. Buy them. Here's another of the Premier Dead Sea products --- once upon a time sold exclusively at high-priced mall kiosks --- that I bought from one of those kiosks at an ultra-high price.I can't say I'm happy to have paid what I did, but the cleanser itself is an amazing item that I have used for years. A dab goes a very very long way, and is far preferable to drying soap. And it is truly amazing to see the grime that comes off on the small cotton-ball used for application.The delivery issues with this provider, I can't address. But the cleanser itself is genuinely terrific, and at this price --- which might seem high, but is less than half its former retail tag --- this is also a great buy. I love this product and I have purchased this item many times. This is a good quality product and it is the only product I ever use on my face. thank you it an honour to shop with you. Do add me on instagram: usana9884025 I have used many high end facial cleansers.  Nothing compares to this one.  It is great for sensitive skin and makes your skin feel great.  Removes makeup well. I love this cleanser. It leaves my skin clean, soft and supple! This may be the best cleanser thst I have ever used. Good for expected which clean skin very clear and not dry for skin, it is good choice for four seasons"
B01MVAQBKI," I use this in conjunction with a battery operated facial brush & my skin glows! Great facial wash. Leaves skin so soft and with even tone. Will definitely purchase again. I really do like this cleanser.  However, be careful as it comes out of the tube rather quickly.  It works really well before my serums as there is no buildup left on the skin orange smell really good. Great face wash! Like all oz natural products, this one did not disappoint. It is a gently cleansers that really does make your face feel refreshed and clean. Very high quality product! I use this cleanser for my morning routine. It leaves a clean but not dry feeling. I love the mix of ingredients and the fact that it contains vitamin C to start the day. The best cleanser! I love all the oz naturals products! Did a lot of research on facial cleansers, moisturizers, and serums. Went with this product for a cleanser because of the ingredients and reviews. I couldn't be happier with the quality of the product. Has great ingredients and makes my face feel so clean and refreshed. When I run out I may try out a different cleanser just to test others. But overall, I'd say this is one of the best facial cleansers you can buy. Nice price too. I love the smell of this cleanser and that it is natural.  The light smell of oranges in the morning is a great way to wake up your skin and your mind. I really like this cleanser. It does not dry my face like some other facial cleansers. It also makes my face feel so soft after. It does do a good job taking all my makeup and dirt off my face at the end of my day. I use it morning amd night before applying other OZNatural products. Really satisfied! Vitamin C cleanser left my face feeling clean but not dry, I was surprised as the small amount needed, at first I squeezed out too much. The directions say to use with a washcloth which is what I did. Removed mascara with no irritation. Especially like that this is natural and no harsh chemicals. I really love this face wash. I use every morning as part of my morning skin routine. I love the way it lathers up, it has a nice citrus scent and leaves my face feeling clean without the drying effect. Definitely will buy again. I love this Vit C facial cleanser!  It leaves my face feeling clean and not dried out.  Plus it doesn't sting my eyes when I rinse my face! Best cleanser out there for my combo skin! Takes all my makeup off - even mascara, and leaves my skin feeling great. Not over dry and tight! I’m loving OZNaturals Vitamin C Facial Cleanser! It is brightening my complexion, deep cleaning my pores, and makes my skin smoother. This is my favorite Oz cleanser.  Love the natural orange smell.  Doesnt make my face oily or dry.  As with most of Oz products it doesn't take much product to cleanse. This cleanser is so gentle on your skin.  It is light weight and cleans gently enough to use multiple times per day.  I have combination skin and I have noticed less oil since using this product in combinati No with others from the OZ Naturals line. Love it! Has a great smell, like citrus almost. Cleans well and seems to tighten my pores slightly. Not overly drying. Great daily cleanser that I would consider mild. I'm the kind of person who needs to see foam to believe something is actually properly cleaning haha this foams up beautifully, leaves your skin very clean but without that dry feeling afterwards. It also smells aaaamazing.Vitamin C helps brighten your skin, giving it a nice glow and I am definitely feeling this cleanser! Excellent cleanser and is the basis for all the other Oz natural products I use. I love that this is so natural. A wonderful natural cleanser that lathers well and leaves my face super clean after a days worth of makeup has come off. I can notice a nice glow after washing my face! I highly recommend this cleanser since it is a great value for your money! Normally my skin is very sensitive to Vitamin C but I've used been using this cleanser every evening y past week and my skin looks and feels great!! A cleanser with Vitamin C? Perfect for those of us that are looking for anti aging products but don't want to pay an arm and a leg. I used this one a couple of times and then my mother tried it (she's 68) and loved it! It has a nice refreshing scent and leaves the skin feeling clean and refreshed too. I've been waiting for this product and – wow – so worth the wait! My skin feels soft and clean immediately after use. No dryness or tightness, which is something I was used to experiencing with cleaners from other brands.My skin has been clearer, too! Great product, it has amazing benefits for the skin. I definitely recommend. Such a lovely cleanser. I keep it in my shower. It has a summery light scent. I love that it also contains HA, E and especially Rose Hips which is a great antioxident. Good job! Love this stuff. It was a great addition to my oz naturals skin care regime! It’s super sensitive and doesn’t dry out my skin. My face is super bright and clean after using this stuff! Works well i love this products...im just a fan of vitamins c for my skin!!!thank you oz naturals for making this products for us to achieve youthful skin!!!highly recommended for this!!i even invited my friends to use this and some of oz naturals products!!!dont wait try and see the result to your skin!! This is a wonderful cleanser.  It has a nice orange scent, and really cleans well without making my face feel dry. This vitamin c facial cleanser is great for my skin. My face is so clean from makeup and dirt after using it. It has a light citrus fragrance that I love. It doesn't irritate my skin. Hard to say what the long term effects will be but after a few weeks, I love this cleanser. It leaves my skin feeling clean and I can see that some of my dark spots are starting to slough off. Underneath is fresh new skin. Thanks, OZ! This is one of my favorite products!Skin has really improved since using this line. Glowing!! This cleanser has a nice scent. Feels great. Can definitely tell it has Vitamin C. Just after a few uses my skin feels softer and has more of a glow! Can't decide which I like better, this or the Ocean Mineral Cleanser. Love it so far! Fresh, gentle, lathers nicely and great price. This stuff rocks. It smells great and is so pleasant to wash your face with! I have been using Neutrogena Deep Clean for over 20 years and I will never replace it.  However, I use this facial cleanser a few times a week just because I use all other OZ products.  Fresh scent and only requires a small drop to clean my face. Great for use with my battery charged cleansing brush. This is the best face wash i have ever used. I’ve battled redness and discoloration my whole life, and within a week of using it (along with their toner) there was a VERY noticeable improvement. At this point it has almost disappeared! I will never use anything else. Love the way it makes my face feel after using it. Don't feel any residue. Leaves skin soft too.. love the fact that a little cleanser goes a long way. Gentle on my skin. Like the way it foams and cleans away make-up. Loving this cleanser.I am vet oily and it seems to be made for that condition.. OZNaturals does it again! This vitamin c cleanser is A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. Super light but yet extra foamy and perfect for sensitive skin. I love the fresh smell of oranges, perfect to kick off my morning routine. I love all things vitamin c for my face. This cleanser is no different. I use this in the morning along with my Seoul vitamin c serum and it’s fantastical. It’s a light cleanser and doesn’t leave a gross film behind. Great cleanser... I love how my skin feels after I use it!  Loving this in combo with the retinol moisuturizer and Vitamin C serum! A complete skincare collection!  Love it! Really Love this cleanser! My face feels clean and fresh without tightness/overdrying! I use this cleanser in the AM and the Ocean Minerals in the PM.  I haven't had any blemishes or breakouts since I started using the OZNaturals line of products! I love this! I am new to skincare and really was looking for something that was lightweight and easy to use as well as something affordable. Not only does this hit the mark on all of that but it is also effective. I use it every morning and I have seen a difference in my skin already after a weeks use! Love the way this smells and it leaves my face soooo clean .... I like to use this with my sonicare  face cleaner brush! Cleans very well as a wonderful scent works well with other Oz natural products.  It's been a short time and I see an improved tone to my skin. This cleanser is amazing! My skin feels clean but not dry. It has a light citrus scent that’s refreshing. It leaves my skin feeling very soft. Love it. This is a wonderful cleanser. It feels and smells great and doesn't dry my skin. I've been using it for a couple of weeks and love it. Fabulous cleanser! My skin felt very clean and I loved the fact that my skin didn't have that tight feeling.I will definitely reach purchase! Perfect partner to the Vitamin C face mask! smooth consistancy I was excited to get this product in the mail yesterday. I tried the cleanser the next morning. The cleanser doesnt tight your skin, or dry your skin. After that I used moisturizer, then Oz serum on my face. And I was good to go. Great cleanser!  Leaves your skin feeling fresh and clean. I love this product! I think it's especially effective to use it before the OZ Naturals Vitamin C mask. It's definitely left my skin brighter and clearer! Vitamin c facial cleanser is the best my skin feels soft and even removed my waterproof mascara The only foaming cleanser that does not dry out my face, it leaves my skin feeling clean and healthy. Will deffently keep buying this product. This face wash is very nice. It doesn’t irritate or dry my sensitive skin. It foams well, and removes make-up and grease nicely. My skin feels clean and refreshed. The smell is faint and pleasant. I’m happy to have found this gem. All of the OZNatural products are wonderful. I believe I'm upto 9 different items and I've not come come across any that I am not completely satisfied with. My skin feels so bright and clean after using this cleanser! Especially when i pair it with the vitamin C serum, obsessed! Awesome and not too drying cleanser Great cleanser. I love that it has vitamin c which helps reduce dark spots. Love that it is all natural Very nice cleanser!  It has not dried out or irritated my skin at all.  It removes all my make up and leaves my face feeling nice and clean. Amazing cleanser! Glowing skin :) I've noticed my skin seems brighter after using this cleanser. My skin tone doesn't appear to be blotchy like it did before! Definitely a must keep in my daily routine! Love it!  You feel clean and refreshed! No residue no drying skin out! I have been using this for about a week now and I’m really happy with it.  I was worried that I would have issues with due to my sensitive skin but so far so good!  My face feels clean and refreshed....I will recommend for sure This is a light weight cleanser not heavy and gunky, it lathers up quite quickly, which I was surprised at by an organic product and cleaned my skin beautifully. Great cleanser!  It lathers nicely and a little goes a long way.  Removes all my makeup without leaving my face tight and dry feeling. Great facial cleanser! Love the orange aroma and cleanses well This cleanser is a gel that foams/bubbles. It leaves the skin very clean but does not strip. Clean smell. A staple. Buy this!!! Only takes a small amount! Great product! I am gnna buy it again . Love Oz cleansers! Amazing product. Love it!!! Recently switched from the Ocean Mineral Cleanser to the Vitamin C. I'm loving it and feel like my leftover pregnancy melasma is fading! Love this  feel refreshing Will give you glowing skin instantly!! A must try Love it! I love this face wash!! It really works too brighten my skin. And it smells wonderful and citrusy, which is so nice in the morning. I also like the fact that it is clear, with no artificial color added, not to mention that it has mostly natural ingredients! I really like this cleanser. I feel like I have a brighter complexion, and just all around more awake looking skin. I have to use a stronger face wash to keep me from breaking out, but I have had really good luck using this one (or the ocean mineral cleanser, I rotate them) in the am, and my salycilic cleanser in the pm. I have always had difficulty with common store brand skincare.  I have very dry, sensitive skin and even the brands that advertise they are moisturizing leave my skin dry, red and irritated.  Once I discovered brands like Oz Naturals that offer skincare products with an emphasis on natural ingredients, I am happy with my skin again and have learned to read ingredients before buying.  I love trying new products that include the ingredients I am looking for and exclude the ones that I know irritate my skin.  Oz Naturals has a great line of skincare that helps improve my dry skin without irritation.  So when they offer a new product, I buy it with confidence based on the ingredient list.  I like to rotate skincare products so my skin gains from the different benefits various products offer.After using the Vitamin C Facial Cleanser by Oz Naturals the past month as part of my cleanser rotation, it is definitely one I will purchase again when it runs out.  I tend to favor citrus-scented products so I find the light scent invigorating, and a good choice for my morning routine.  It's thin in texture so be careful not to use too much.  I did the first time and learned that I only need a small amount for my face and neck.  It lathers well, but not too much so it rinses off easily and my face feels clean without any soapy residue.  Since I don't wear makeup, I can't speak to how it removed makeup, but as a gentle facial cleanser, it's very effective for my needs.  My skin doesn't feel overly dry after using it like it tends to with most cleansers and it has not produced any irritation or redness.  I'm also a fan of the tube style containers for soap - it's much easier to dispense and takes up less room in my tiny bathroom.  And the bright orange color makes it easy to find in a hurry. I love using this Vitamin C face wash in the morning! The fresh smell of oranges to wake you up is an added bonus. It's a bit thin but lathers up really nicely and also means you only need a very small amount. Any products I use from OzNaturals has been the same; a little goes a long way!When looking at the benefits if the face wash there is:vitamin c + necessary for collagen production & a potent antioxidanthyaluronic acid + keeps collagen synthesis up & retains skin moisturerose hips + antioxidants to combat free radicalsvitamin e + prevent & repair free radical damage98% naturalUse a good serum & moisturizer afterwards! My favorite is the Oz Naturals Vitamin C  Serum with AHA + it's a perfect match for this face wash! OZNaturals Vitamin C Facial Cleanser - The Most Effective Anti Aging Face Wash + The Natural Skin Care Solution For Clean Pores And A Healthy, Radiant Glow. 98% Natural, 4 oz. tubeFeed your face has taken on a whole different meaning with the OZ cleansers— the OZ Naturals Vitamin C Facial Cleanser and the Ocean Mineral Facial Cleanser. I use both and alternate at will, since both are filled with nourishing, natural ingredients. And yes, I notice that both improve the look of my skin. Someone told me last night at a birthday party for OLD friends that I looked beautiful. Aw, shucks. (And I didn’t have a lot of makeup on.) But when I got home and washed my face with the Vitamin C cleanser and looked in the mirror, I was like...Oh, OK. I could see her point. Vitamin C products always seem to do it for me and I use the OZ Naturals Vitamin C mask regularly as well. The 98 percent non-artificial ingredients in the Vitamin C cleanser are cold pressed, which means that heat doesn’t degrade the antioxidants packed in there—not just the Vitamin C, but E, and the highly touted rose hip oil, goji berry and hyaluronic acid. No harmful preservatives. I laugh at the more expensive skin care lines with their non-natural ingredients and harsh perfume smells. And by the way, the citrus smell to the OZ Naturals Vitamin C Facial Cleanser is delicious. I recommend this cleanser without reservation. Throw away all your skin products and only use OzNaturals.I have been using OzNaturals products now for over 3 years.I am 67 years old and I get so many compliments on my skin. Their products are truly AMAZING! You will see results very quickly. I had many wrinkles before and now most are gone. The texture of my skin is so soft now.There are some of the products that I use daily:OzNaturals Pro-RetaxinolOzNaturals Vitamin C SerumOzNaturals Hyaluronic Acid SerumOzNaturals Eye Gel Eye Cream and OzNaturals Ageless Eye Cream (I rotate between the two of these for underneath my eyes)I put the serums in the refrigerator so that I get a very cooling effect when applying these serums on my skin.They are a FABULOUS company with wonderful ingredients in their products.Their customer service is EXCELLENT! They respond very quickly to emails and after purchasing their products they send you very detailed information on when and how to use their products.OzNaturals was one of the first to sell skin products on Amazon. They are constantly coming out with new versions to improve their products. It smells like Delsym orange flavor so while I dislike it, it's like the other OzNaturals Vitamin C products. As a cleaner, it leaves my face squeaky clean. I use this in the shower and it does a great job cleaning off the sunscreen. You must follow with serum and/or moisturizer, because I used it then missed a spot with my moisturizer and it started to flake the next morning. It's thinner than I expected so I squeezed too much the first time, so a little dab is more than enough to remove the grease. This is a nice face wash, my face feels smooth and soft afterward and it's not drying. I'm alternating this with the ocean mist cleanser weekly and I have to admit, I like this one better! Both are great for different reasons though. Great way to start my day. This cleanser has a nice orange scent to it and is a great little extra pick me up in the morning. It isn't too watery which I like. I hate when a cleaner is more liquid, it feels harder for me to clean my face. This cleanser lathers up really nicely with just a little bit of product. I have combo skin that leans more towards the oily side and this cleanser does a great job of cleaning my pores and helping me control that. After some use, my skin has even felt softer! The OZ Naturals Vitamin C Facial Cleanser has Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, Rose Hips and Vitamin E in it. I love that is 98% natural so I don't have to worry about what I am putting on my face. Overall a great cleanser and I am very happy with it! I needed a new cleanser, so I actually bought the OZNaturals Vitamin C and Ocean Mineral Cleansers together. I use this one in the morning and the other one at night. I have to say, I love how refreshed my skin feels after using them. What I really like about this one is the hint of bright, refreshing scent, which helps mentally perk me up a bit. Additionally, I've already started feeling like I've had an improvement in my skin, and it's clearer than it has been in a while. Highly recommend! I have been waiting to get this cleanser for awhile.  A friend of mine suggested that I try it.  I like this cleanser not only because it is Vitamin C based it is 98% natural according the label.  This cleanser does not dry out my face but it does cleanse well.  Just a  couple of drops and it lathers well.  There is no strong fragrance and so far I have not had any adverse reaction to it.  My skin is on the sensitive side so it is quite the process to find a cleanser that does not irritate my skin.  Among other ingredients are:  Vitamin E, Hyaluronic Acid, Rose Hips.  After cleansing I use a Vitamin C serum and moisturizer which together work very well for me so far. I really wanted to try this product to help brighten my dark spots and even out my complexion. So far it helped and I know with continued use my dark spots will be gone. I have also used this to take off my make up and it worked with only one wash! It has a citrus smell and the gel texture, you only need a little of the product. The product shipped fast and OZ Naturals has great customer service. I would recommend and buy again. I was in the market for a new facial cleanser when I found this one.  I love that this cleanser  has Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, Rose Hips and Vitamin E.  This is a very mild cleanser with a light citrus scent.  Perfect for morning cleansing :)  It is clear and natural.  It suds up nicely and rinses off easily.  My face feels clean but not dry or tight.  I follow up with the Ocean Mineral Tonic (which I love, love).  I love the naturalness of the OZ products.  I recommend them often. I love this facial cleaner. The scent is subtle and light. It suds up really well. I like the soft feel of the foam on my skin. It rinses well too. It leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh. It does make my skin feel a little bit dry though, that's why I always do toner and moisturizer right away after I cleanse my face with this cleanser. Overall, I highly recommend OZ Naturals Vitamin C Facial Cleanser. OZNaturals makes fantastic products, and this is no exception! I find that nearly every cleanser I use makes my face feel tight and dry after use, but not this one! My face feels clean, smooth, and not the least bit dry. Due to its effective cleansing, my pores appear diminished and my skin looks brighter. I use this cleanser in the morning, and the OZNaturals Ocean Mineral cleanser in the evening and the combination is working really well for me. I find this Vitamin C cleanser is not quite as soothing to my skin as the Ocean mineral (likely due to the vitamin C), but both are amazing products and I would repurchase either in a heartbeat. There are 3 key ingredients that I use in my skin care routine- hyaluronic acid, vitamin c, and retinol. I also want skin care products that is natural/nontoxic (no parabens, no phthalates, no petrochemicals) , environmentally conscious,  and cruelty free. AND I want the products to be gentle enough for my sensitive skin,  effective, and reasonably priced. This is a tall order, but Oz Naturals checks all the boxes! This cleanser has vitamin C and hyaluronic acid (very effective ingredients) and has a nice citrusy scent. You only need a small amount and it lathers nicely. Highly recommended! I love facial cleansers and I love that this facial cleanser has a light citrus scent. It smells like oranges to me! I placed this cleanser on my face brush and it suds up nicely. It doesn't leave my skin dry and my skin feels deeply clean. I follow up with a toner (OzNaturals Ocean Mineral Tonic) and my moisturizer. I also love the fact that this cleanser has Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, Rose Hips, and Vitamin E. These are all great for the health of your skin. This product is also 98% natural. For best results, use day and night for glowing skin. I am a OZ Natural women having used their products for years because they are made with 98.6 percent natural ingredients without the junk that is in so many other skincare lines. It is also made in the US!. I rotate the Vitamin C Facial Cleanser with the Mineral Oil Cleanser which do not dry out my face! I highly recommend the OZ skincare line! It was recommended for my teenage daughter to stop using bar soap on her face because it was drying it out. I was pretty disappointed at the list of ingredients on the ones that were recommended to her, she's too young to have all these chemicals in the products. I came across OZNaturals and thought I would let her try it. So far she hasn't had any issues with it and seems to be gentle enough on her sensitive skin. She says it makes her face feel clean and soft. I’ve tried this cleanser, as well as their ocean minerals, and while both perform very well, and are gentle on skin, I prefer this vitamin C formula. It lathers nicely, and has a slight citrus smell to it, and doesn’t leave your face dry or thirsty. Vitamin c products help even skin tone and reverse the appearance of sun damage, so it’s a must for everybody. You get a very nice amount, in attractive packaging. It’s definitely worth the money. Oz Naturals products really perform well, and I love that they’re 95-99% natural. As a big fan of Oz Naturals, I was really looking forward to trying this facial cleanser. I have been using it now for about a month in the morning. It's light orange scent is exceptionally refreshing and removes all the oil from my face without drying it out. I follow up with a combination of Oz facial moisturizers and have found this to be a great way to start my day. This is my regular morning cleanser and I love it! It is so gentle that I don't have to follow it with a moisturizer, which is great when you're in a hurry...and I'm often in a hurry. My skin feels clean for hours after, so even when I have to apply my sunscreen mid day I don't feel grimey if I can't wash again. I love this cleanser. I use quite a few products from this line and have noticed so many positive changes to my skin. I usually alternate this and their Ocean Minerals cleanser, which is also awesome. I like the way my skin feels soft and clean after I use it! So glad it is back in stock again! So glad I gave this cleanser a try. My skin feels clean & refreshed yet not completely stripped of all its natural oils. I love how much it suds (how I feel I know its working) & I prefer to use this with my clarisonic & I switch between this & OZ's Ocean Minerals cleansers. Both are amazing! One of my favorite foaming cleansers.  I was first introduced to this product through Ipsy and I've been a fan ever since.  It gives a gentle but thorough cleanse and works fantastically paired with my Clarisonic.  It always leaves my skin perfectly prepped for the remainder of my skincare routine.  Absolutely love it!! The first thing that strikes me when I use this is the smell...it smells ahhhhhhh-mazing!!! Like oranges! What a beautiful way to start the day! Then, bonus, my skin is getting hyaluronic acid and antioxidants as I wash my face! I love this cleanser very much. And, it only takes a TINY amount to cleanse the entire face. Overall, I think its a tremendous value. If you tried vitamin C mask, you probably can recognize the smell in this cleanser. It's a very mild and nice smell, which doesn't linger and doesn't bother me. The cleanser is gentle on the skin, but removes even the toughest makeup without a problem. It doesn't dry out the skin. this product is delicious on the skin.  It foams enough to wash your face but not enough to where you need to rinse forever to get it off.  You can even leave it on for a while and brush your teeth.  Your skin will be noticeably different the first time you use it, and it really only gets better.  The look is impressively better within a couple of days of using it once daily.  I've paid more for way less, this is really nice on my face. I've just started using this product and so far its been doing the job. I use this in the morning and the Ocean Mineral Cleanser at night. This Vitamin C cleanser goes well with the brand's Vitamin C Serum and I have not noticed any dryness using this product. Its full of great and natural ingredients that complement the vitamin C. It's thinner than I thought it was going to be but it lathers up very nicely and cleans my face very well. I love this product ! I was excited to try this because it’s all natural ingredients . I use it in the mornings - and the scent is very light , which is a huge plus for me . Just enough citrus scent - I love it ! You don’t need to use too much to cleanse your face and neck , just a small amount does great and it lathers up and rinses well too . My skin feels so clean and smooth after using ! Just wow! I usually wouldn’t write a review for a cleanser, but I just need to say that this is becoming my favorite cleanser ever!While it’s unscented, there’s a very very slight natural citrus scent. Which I’m loving, and it’s like a gel oil but not oily! My skin isn’t dry or tight after using this! I use this cleanser at night with my electronic face brush with this too! ❤️👍🏼❤️ Great cleanser and smells wonderful! The fact that this cleanser is made with 98.6% natural products makes me feel good about using it on my face. You only need a little bit which foams up nicely and makes your skin feel clean and soft. Love the orange smell. Another great OZ Naturals product! I love how this cleanser it light and doesn't make my skin feel dry or tight after I use it.  I love using this in the morning for a pick me up or when I'm going to use the vitamin c mask. I switch between this cleanser and the sea mineral one that OZ Naturals carries. Really great cleanser. Fantastic ingredients and it left my skin clean without feeling dried out. Lathers well too. It almost feels hydrating, which usually doesn't happen with gel cleansers. When I used my toner there was nothing left on the cotton pad (and I wear a full face of makeup). Good stuff. I have sensitive, dry skin. I like to use anti aging products, but it’s hard to find for sensitive skin. This face wash is wonderful! Full of amazing goodness for my skin & doesn’t dry it out! Pleasant faint smell, clean skin that doesn’t feel stripped or dry afterwards. Would buy again. I started using this as part of my morning routine about a week ago and I couldn't be happier. I really like the smell and a little goes a long way. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean. Very happy with my purchase. Another oz naturals product for the win! I am so glad I took a shot and tried this cleanser. I have been using in the in mornings before my other skin care products. I lather it in my hands, and use only a small amount. My face feels clean and fresh afterwards. There is a host of great ingredients in this, and so far so good !! OZNaturals has great products and this cleanser is no different. I use it to remove my makeup and cleanse my skin and I love that it doesn't leave that tight, stripped feeling when I rinse it off. Bonus points for great smell, too! i have pretty sensitive skin and it's always a task to find a face wash that works and doesn't irritate my skin. i was surprised by this product! it's clear and viscous, so it's easy to spread on the skin. it lathers nicely and has a light citrus scent. it washes away cleanly, leaving no residue. and it hasn't bothered my skin at all! it's even gentle on my eyes, which is a huge plus. i'm a fan! I love this refreshing face wash! I enjoy the soft citrus scent and how the cleanser gently cleans my face. It does not leave my skin too dry or irritated. I follow with Oz Naturals serum and moisturizer. Smells wonderful.  Cleans my face well without drying out my skin.  I use it also to remove my makeup.  I'm trying to remember to squeeze the tube gently as a little bit goes a long way. This face wash is really great at removing makeup and dirt without drying out your skin. Nice fresh smell and leaves your face feeling clean and smooth. Great product to add to your skin regimen. I love this vitamin C facial cleanser. It works so well for my skin, and is non irritating. My face is prone to break outs and this cleanser works at keeping them from happening. My skin looks amazing. It is soft, clearer and brighter. Definitely one of my favorite facial cleansers. Plus it’s made with natural ingredients. This OZNaturals facial cleanser makes my face really smooth and feels so clean. I leave it on face for about 2 minutes while continuously massaging my skin. It's so refreshing after rinsing with cold water.Wish they could make it fragrance free. The scent is too strong for me. That's the only negative I can say. Other than that, this is an effective natural facial cleanser. I pretty much love vitamin C in my skin care routine. This cleanser is no different. It's gently, yet effective in cleaning the face. I use daily and have not seen any irritation to my sensitive, acne prone skin. I look forward to seeing how it effects my acne scars over time. I love this cleanser. It smells slightly citrus and really makes my skin feel great. I highly recommend it. It is in my top 3 of favorite cleansers. Really like this cleanser.  It's a gel formula which works well with my oily skin.  The vitamin C has brightened my skin and helped to lightly fade some dark spots that I have.  gentle cleanser that should work for most skin types. Amazeballs...I have only been using this cleanser for about a week but wow. My skin has really cleared up and old acne marks have started to heal. i use this face wash every morning and I really like it. I also like the light citrus scent which I find wakes the skin up in the morning and energizes it. This product has a light citrus scent. The clear gel cleanses my face without drying it out. No irritation and my skin isn't irritated. Would purchase again. I enjoy using this product. It makes my face feel clean and it smells great. Using it after you fist wake up is nice because it makes you feel more awake. I did not expect to love this cleanser as much as I have. It has actually simplified my routine and gets all my makeup off quite simply. My other soap didn't get everything off, so I'd have to follow up with a different cleanser after. The smell of this is just ""OK"". But its nice to know the ingredients are more natural. Definitely a must keep in my daily routine.You feel clean and refreshed.leaves my face feeling nice and clean. Very good facial cleanser. Comes in a nice box. Great presentation. I like the company. Silky smooth feel. No artificial smell or feel. Ingredients feel natural and not at all harsh. I like this product and got two different cleansers from them this company is legit, great products. Try them! Beautiful packaging, Quick delivery, Cleans without causing break outs. Best natural face cleaner.  I will be reordering. This is actually an amazing cleanser any time of day, but the light citrus scent is a perfect ""wake me up"" first thing in the morning. As others have said, you definitely don't need to use much of this product. I use the Oz Naturals Ocean Mineral Cleanser at night, so both tubes end up lasting a really long time. Deep cleans my pores without over-drying, and the fact that it's almost 100% natural makes it a definite repurchase for me! Another fantastic product by the wonderful skin care experts at OZ Naturals!  I have been eagerly waiting for this facial cleanser to be released, and I was not disappointed when I finally received it! This cleanser is great: it smells good, it is gentle, and it is very effective!  I love that I was able to add this cleanser to my OZ Naturals facial care routine! The Vitamin C facial cleanser is a clear, gel consistency. It has a very faint citrus smell that is not overwhelming. It lathers and cleans well, but doesn't feel harsh or over-drying. It is suitable for daily use in the morning and evening as part of a skincare regimen. I also appreciate that it is free toxic ingredients yet effective. Love, LOVE, love Vitamin C!! I know there are a lot of effective products out there but for me Vitamin C products show results the quickest. Nice healthy glow to the skin. Absolutely crazy in love with the the orange citrus smell! It cleans well without drying and has a wonderful ingredient deck- hyaluronic acid, rose hip oil, goji berry, vitamin E and our super potent form of Vitamin C. A little pea size amount is plenty so it will last a long time.  Absolutely nothing not to love about this product. The vitamin C in this cleanser has a nice smell and it lathers well leaving clean and fresh skin - easy to use in the shower and you only need such a small amount - great value for money for a natural alternative to all those cleansers that are full of chemicals and doing who knows what damage to your skin! Great for aging skin also :-) Love this product. The smell, how it feels when I apply. The whole shabang!!! Will keep buying. I love this face wash!"
B01KWYRCWC," Love! Creamy and gentle.  Smells clean and fresh.  I've stocked up so I don't run out. I have been using this product for about a year now and my skin is noticeably softer! I love how my skin feels during and after using this cleanser. The scent is spa like and not too overpowering. The cleanser is also gentle for my skin. The texture is more of a cream moisturizer- very soothing. Big fan of this! I love this face wash! It's gentle on my skin and creates a smooth lather. I've used it day and night for the last month or so and it's made an amazing difference with my skin. I was not blessed with naturally unblemished skin as a teenager and some of that acne and oily/dry combination skin has continued into adulthood (I'm turning 31 this month). I usually check my face for blemishes proactively so I can address them before they truly break out and I've had to really peer at my skin to find any. I plan on continuing to use this and would recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable solution for combination skin. The milky feel is also luxurious and leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshed. Easy to apply, a little goes a long way, and way to take off. Cleans thoroughly and gently. Even my 23-year old son uses it. Great for exfoliant, also for moisture. Has antioxidants to keep skin looking young. This is so refreshing and moisturizing. I prefer using it in the morning because I like to use a more purifying cleanser at night. But for someone with sensitive, dry skin, this is the perfect way to wake up! Doesn't strip fair/sensitive skin of moisture- instead it seems to leave it feeling softer. A+! Love it....recommend for sensitive skin! I like is good for clean my face my face look most clean and fresh. I adore this cleanser. My skin is normal and slightly sensitive so I try to use a gentle skin care regime with it. It doesn't strip my skin and keeps it nicely balanced. Great for every day use! Would buy again!! This has been a great product to try.  It is smooth and leaves my face fresh.  It has no scent and the texture is ligtht. HOLY CLEANSER! My face has NEVER been so clear! This is the first thing in my facial routine. I use it twice a day, morning and night. I love how smooth it makes my face and the vey light scent it has. I dont think I'll use a different cleanser again! I  love the Vivo products. This product rocks!!! I could go on and on about Vivo products. Love this cleanser!! It doesn't dry my skin out and it smells great!! My skin has definitely become very smoooth. The cleaning foam is gentle and smells good Very good product."
B00AO4EMKQ," These wipes are great! Works wonderful for sensitive skin!! Takes makeup off very easily and does not dry out skin. Love these.  So handy on the go.  Like them so well that I use them at home as well.  I don't feel the need for moisturizer after as they leave skin feeling clean & great. I absolutely love these face wipes, so easy to use and so convenient. They really get the dirt, grime and makeup off of your face quickly. Definitely an essential part of my skin care regimen. I also love these amazing new skin care vitamins Vitamiss Youth – Anti-Inflammatory, Antioxidant & Anti-Aging Supplement that help my skin look younger! Great product love these wipes. Nothing better than grabbing one after work or a date or whatnot and wiping off the makeup. These wipes are pretty economical and they really get the job done. I do not wear a ton of makeup but has done a great job for me! I just really use foundation, concealer, sometimes eyeshadow, eyeliner and mascara but usually not. I am more a natural look. But on occasion when I need to get done up these wipes still conquer all the makeup!I haven't used these for other purposes like after a work out etc but to be honest I actually shower after I use these anyways (since I use them for makeup removal usually means end of day) so I haven't seen whether the wipes themselves have a benefit when you leave the wipe stuff on.But I'd rec these. Good product! Out of all the makeup removal wipes I've tried (and I've tried quite a few of them), this is the most economic choice.The price on Amazon is fabulous, and it does what it's supposed to.  Doesn't clean my face overdry, and it doesn't feel greasy at all.I do wash my face with an oil cleanser and a facial wash after this (I'm very particular about cleaning my face at the end of the night), so this serves as a first step.  It removes all the color off my face so it doesn't get on my washcloth.  But I've gone to bed once or twice when I've cleaned my face with just this, and I was surprised that my skin didn't suffer too much.Bang for buck, this is a great choice for anyone who wears makeup on a daily basis. I usually do a full facial cleansing regime at night and decided to get these for when I'm too tired to deal with it. I've never used the cleansing wipes, but I love them! There's no smell and they don't dry out the skin. The makeup came off without a problem too.  I will definitely be ordering more of these when I run out. I love these. Great way to ""clean your face"" after a long day. Removes eye makeup gently and leaves my face feeling smooth and not dry. Great for traveling to clean up without a using a wash-washing routine. And the best part—never harms your skin. I have mature skin and these are by far my favorite facial wipes. Watch for sales or two for one special, here on Amazon as well as on Ulta. (Wife Reviewing!)I use these to take off my make up before I wash my face. Comes off very easily! I have very sensitive skin so if I rub too hard it will sting a bit, but it removes make up easily enough that I can wipe gently. One wipe removes all my foundation. These are not suitable for waterproof mascara, I just take that off first with an oil-free liquid make-up remover from Target. This is a great price, it costs almost half of what I would pay in store. Very good value compared to brands that I've purchased at high end make up stores & at big box pharmacy stores.  These remove my ""bulletproof"" makeup, waterproof eyeliner & mascara, etc.  Wonderful for traveling!  I plan to continue using these. I love these facial wipes! I have never had problem skin, and don't like using harsh cleansers with unnecessary additives on my face.  I bought these a few weeks ago and just placed my second order.  (My son has been using them on his face as well - so I know they are great!)  I use one every morning, when I wake up, and I feel refreshed and my face feels truly clean.  I will be buying these on a regular basis! I use these every night and some mornings to wash my face. My daughter was using some fancy brand and borrowed one of mine and fell in love too. These are great wipes! The have a fresh smell and leave your face feeling clean. These are the best face wipes I have used. They are gentle and never dry like many other brands. I can use these everyday and they don't ever dry me out or irritate my skin. Getting the four pack is a good deal too. These are holy grail for me These are awesome!! Absolutely love them if I could give more than five stars I would. I have extremely sensitive skin and all the others I've tried either didn't take my makeup off or they left my skin super irritated. These take off my makeup with ease and leave my skin feeling clean, refreshed and hydrated. I even bought some to put in my boat even though I don't wear makeup on the boat. I love washing my fave with these. Hands down the best face wipes! I have sensitive skin. These are the only wipes that don't feel like my eyelids are coming off with it. Takes waterproof off, no problem. I have breakouts with other wipes. These don't cause that issue either. I was very unsure about these. But when I used them to take a full faced of face painting off my daughter, glitter and all, I believed. This was wonderful to use . I didn't have to get soap in her eyes and have her crying. I think its great to keep on had just for that. So taking of grown up makeup too was easy. Usually I use the Burt and Bees wipes because they're gentle and don't burn my eyes when I wipe over them. So I decided to give these a try, and they are now one of my favorite products! The scent is clean and subtle, and my skin feels fresh when I use these. My face and eyes don't burn after usage, so that's a plus for me. Will definitely buy again. I've used many different face wash pads in the past and the Simple brand is the one I stick with religiously. They are gentle on my sensitive skin and large enough to give my face a wipe-over at least three times. At the end, I use them to help remove my eye makeup, too (although those specific pads are also strongly recommended, and I keep both on regular Subscribe and Save rotation). Others that you have to wet to use are a mess, and gone are the days of actual soap and a washcloth. Just pull a prewet cloth out of the package and go! i have oily skin during the day, and these wipes come in pretty handy My favorite and go to make up wipes! It doesn't burn your eyes like the Neutrogena ones! These are really nice facialworks my daughter really enjoy using them when she's removing her lip gloss and or eyeliner she doesn't wear much makeup but for when she does these wipes definitely come in handy I am extremely busy and I know that I should be washing my face more but someday's I just need the convince. I decided to give these a try and kept them on my nightstand to avoid falling asleep in makeup. The first night I tried them out I fell in love with this product. It left my skin feeling very soft and they smell great! I noticed a huge difference in my skin that compared to when I cleanse with water. After buying this product I was at the mall and picked up what I thought would be something similar, huge mistake!! I'm throwing those out and going back to Simple Cleansing Wipes. I purchased these for my husband.  He works in a shop and had a job interview immediately after his shift so he needed something to ""wash"" his face before the interview.  I tried to find something that wouldn't be irritating, didn't have a girly scent, and could cut through the grease and grunge.  These worked out great!  They cleaned him up the same as if he washed his face at a sink and cleared away all the shop gunk.  It was a big package for just the single use, but I will certainly use the rest.  There is a little bit of a scent, but nothing overpowering.Another reviewer mentioned that their packages were dried out, but I didn't have that problem.  The wipes we used were all damp and fresh.  These are great to use in a pinch! I've been getting these for awhile. Affordable, remove layers of makeup, (waterproof mascara is tough and I don't wear it anymore anyways), doesn't break out my sensitive skin. These are great for sensitive skin. I use these for a quick face cleanup first thing in the morning if I don’t jump in the shower right away. I also cut up into four sections and store in a separate baggie and use to remove eye makeup. Also use before and after working out. Take them with me everywhere. Love them! My daughter and I love these makeup wipes. They really get all the makeup and dirt off your face without drying it out. Gentle yet effective. Don't know how I got along without them! I know these are wasteful but they haves improved my skin care regime and have even started breaking up some of large dark sun spots on my face, which was a bonus I wasn't expecting. These moist wipes feel good on your face and easily clean away the day's makeup.  I still use another product for waterproof mascara and long-lasting lipstick, but I use the wipe to finish the eyes and lips. My skin is smooth and ready for  nighttime creams. My husband and son also like them to freshen their faces. It works for my sensitive skin. Yay!! no breakouts like when using soap and water. Also, no more styes around my eyes because it fully removes all my eye makeup. Yes, I use quite a few of them but I have this on my Subscribe and Save orders so I'm saving money. I love these wipes. I began using them over one year ago. I ran out once and used Burt's Bees wipes and my face broke out terribly! These are gentle, yet effective at getting off waterproof mascara. I used to get these at CVS but now get them through Amazon on my subscribe and save account. They work well at taking off my make up and are a good value. I use these daily and my skin feels clean and soft. Now that it's hot, I use them for a quick refresh and the cloth is large enough to cover more than just my face and neck. Handy when not at home, also. I have a lot of problems with my face and this does not irritate my skin. This is my first time trying this brand for facial wipes. To start, the wipes, as some reviews have stated, are not very wet. This doesn't mean they're old or dried out because I can assure you that they are very effective when it comes to cleansing your face. True to their advertisement, this product leaves little residue on your skin. The wipes are very soft and they smell nice - no strong odors, just light and clean.I have used these wipes in many different ways, so if you were wondering I will let you know how they work for each of the following:1. In the morning as a refresher. If I'm running late in the morning, I throw a pack of wipes into my bag. You can use it in the car, waiting in traffic (not recommended for safety reasons), in the bathroom - it's portable and convenient. It gives your face a fresh look and no one will ever know you woke up 5 minutes ago.2. Throughout the day. If you have oily skin like I do, by mid day your skin is shining with oil, or maybe it's a hot day out and you feel gross and want to wash your face. Just pull one out when you go to the bathroom or something, wipe your face and neck, and you're good to go.3. At night after a party or a long day. These wipes take make up off - even water proof make up. You come back from a long day of work or a night out with friends and you're just too tired or lazy to take your make up off. Pull out a wipe, it takes off ALL the make up.The best part is you don't even have to wash your face afterwards because there's virtually no residue. It won't leave your skin feeling oily or soapy. I broke both my arms and was unable to wash my face with my usual product so I tried these wipe. VOILA! Clean smooth refreshed skin primied for moisturizer. Even when my arms are functional, I will continue to use these as part of my nighttime regime. The formula is great, because it leaves me skin feeling smooth and clean and blemish-free, without drying out my skin (unlike some other tea tree oil pads I've been using). I have oily/combination skin, and this is perfect for clearing it out and maintaining a healthy balance of oil. I have very sensitive skin and these towels are a savior for me.  I can take off my makeup very quick without feeling my skin irritated or overdry.  They are gentle to your skin but strong enough to remove makeup even waterproof mascara. Very nice product. I'm very pleased with this. I used to use another product for my face and a separate one for eye make up remover and this allows me to do both effectively. My face feels clean and these work without being heavily scented. Love this! Perfect size for my overnight bag, I buy the big packs for everyday use, so I know I like the product already. Doesn't leave your face feeling dry. No residue left on your hands. Thick cloth toss away wipes, hold together well when using. my favorite cleansing wipes. they get the job done especially on the lazy nights where i don't do my full facial regimen. these guys do the job well enough i don't feel bad about it. generous size and they are not too wet  nor too dry. Best wipes I have used yet. Makeup comes right off and my skin seems better overall as well. While I use these at home frequently, I consider them essential for travel. This works as a thorough but gentle face wash morning or at the end of the day. I use it to remove even eye make up before I pass out from a busy day. I’ve tried dozens of face wipes, but these have to be one of my favorites. They don’t have a smell, my face doesn’t sting, doesn’t leave residue, doesn’t make me break out, removes stubborn makeup. I like that the wipes have dual textures: smooth and textured, so you can cater the level of exfoliation based on your individual needs.

I don't feel like I need to rinse it off after using, like some other face wipes or make-up removers. Sometimes when my face it too dry from the cold weather I will use one of these instead of moisturizer. I Know on the packaging it states Simple is the sensitive skin experts.

My mistake!]  I bought this first in a store and then on Subscribe and Save--and then that offer was removed.  In looking in local stores, I found that this ""formula"" was always missing so I tried these which do not work for me:  Exfoliating 2/1/0 and Oil Balancing 2/0/0.As of this order, I was able to use the Add On feature in Amazon--for which I am grateful.  All it takes is a little pre-planning on my part and remembering that I need to include this in a $25.00 purchase.

Love these face wipes- I use them every day! Very pleasant smell & just the right amount of moisture Works great. So pleased that bought this. Great for my teenagers. Exfoliates as well as refreshes. Takes makeup off too. Takes off my make up really well. I have sensitive skin and many makeup wipes make my skin burn or dry it out l, but these are moist and sensitive and workReally well Works as intended. I love these wipes and use them as part of my nightly routine. I also pack them in my overnight bag or on trips when I'm unsure I can do a thorough cleansing at night. It takes off pretty much all my makeup face with just one wipe, but I'll admit they aren't great on taking off mascara. Doesn't sting or feel tacky on my skin afterwards. If I'm drunk, I'm pretty comfortable using just these before I pass out instead of washing my face. I have very sensitive skin especially on my face. These don't irritate me at all. I used them for removing makeup or whenever I feel like i need to refresh my face. My skin bounces back and forth between insanely oily and super dry. Annoying, yes. But i have found that i can use these wipes no matter what. Total steal at $6 for a two pack. True to its name, it's pretty simple. It removes makeup, no scent, easy peasy. LOVE. removes all makeup in a swipe. My favorite facial product! These are amazing! My favorite face wipes. Works as expected I love these wipes. I have very sensitive skin and these aren't irritating at all. They're great at removing make up as well. They're unscented and not harsh at all. Great product Work great and great price! I rebuy these all the time, gets my makeup off and feels really refreshing. Isn’t tested on animals which is a must for me. Great product! I have sensitive skin and it's not harsh at all. Wonderful Nice to have facial cloths portable, slight stickiness to face after using but acceptable be cause my face looks good. Work good but wish they were a little more damp Love these wipes. I am prone to acne but these help keep my skin at a happy medium. Great value and product.  I have very sensitive skin, even most 'sensitive' products irritates my skin.  Never had a problem with this product.  Takes off makeup easily and even waterproof eye makeup- no eye tugging.I recommend this to anyone. Skin issues and non-skin issues. Love these. Super effective on my sensitive skin. This is an excellent product for sensitive skin.  It is sometimes hard to find.  I was happy to get it from Amazon Marketplace--Range Plus.  It came from the UK, and delivery was before the estimated time given by Amazon.  Highly recommended. Does a good job removing  make-up without irritation. I really like these Simple Cleansing Facial Wipes 25 ct, Twin pack.  You save by buying the twin pack and they are easy to use.  I use them every night before bed to make sure all the dirt and/or make up is off of my face and neck.  I have oily skin that really needs to be cleaned again at night and these make the job fast and easy.  I can then use my toner and/ or any other treatments I want to use. These are great. They take off even waterproof eyeliner and they don't sting the eyes. This removes my makeup very well. It works well on sensitive skin too because it doesn't irritate my face like some of the other brands do. perfect I have tried sooooo many different brands of makeup wipes and these are by far my favorite. They do not sting around the eye area and get rid of makeup (I wear waterproof mascara) easily. I love how gentle they are on my sensitive skin. These will be the only brand of makeup wipes I buy from now on. :) Very nice. Cleans very well. I have tried different facial wipes from brands such as Neutrogena and Garnier but Simple is my favorite. It really does its job with just one facial wipe which I appreciate. It leaves my skin feeling so clean without stripping it dry. It removes waterproof makeup too! Love this twin pack where I can get 2 and stock up. Highly recommend! These are amazing. The only wipes to reduce my adult acne significantly. These took off my waterproof makeup easily! The cloths were soft and moist. I mostly get these for my teenage daughter. She has many allergies and very sensitive skin. These cleansing wipes have worked out fantastic for her. She uses them to clean, freshen or remove make from her face. I wasn't happy at the cost of buying them locally (drugstore or grocery store). It actually hadn't occurred to me to check online and was pleasantly surprised to see that Amazon had the best price. I use this on days when I'm too lazy to use makeup remover. One wipe removes all my foundation and other makeup. The scent is refreshing as well. I have sensitive skin especially around my eyes and this item does not irritate it at all. I tried wipes from the Body Shop and reacted horribly. These are gentle enough that it does not make me break out nor sting. Will definitely be using these for the rest of my life. I wear a moderate amount of makeup, and one wipe cleans my face without any heavy chemical smells or burning.  Gentle and doesn't dry out my skin. I’ve been using these wipes for years not (they’re amazing) this is the best bang for my buck I’ve seen! I love these to clean off makeup or just wash my face before bed Awesome wipes. I love Simple face wipes! My favorite thing is that they are never too wet like some other brands get. I never have to wring them out before using. They take off all my makeup easily and leave my skin feeling clean and not makeup remover greasy. The wipes are so nice too for when I don't have time for my full skincare routine to just wipe and go. These are the only face wipes I use.  They get off all of my makeup and are perfect for just before bed when I'm ""too lazy to get up and wash my face.""  They have a very neutral scent as to not irritate the skin or eyes.  This price is unbeatable too...I usually buy the single pack from Target for $7. I use these after I work out each day and it has eliminated acne caused by sweat! Cleans your face very well and leave you refreshed. I wouldn't recommend using them more than once a day because they make my face feel a bit dry afterwards. I would imagine use on a non-oily/sweaty face would really dry you out. Overall, a great post-workout face wipe! I was delighted to find a twin pack of my favorite cleaning cloths.  I have sensitive skin and the perfumes on other brands causes me to break out.  This was a great price and I will order these again. I've used other facial wipes in the past, including Neutrogena, and they tend to make my eczema worse and give me dry skin patches. Ive been using these one for almost a month, and so far my skin is good! I have very sensitive skin. These get all the dirt and make up without breaking me out. LOVE LOVE LOVE these. They are the only face wipes I've used that don't make my face feel all sticky or smelly afterward. They are in my subscribe and save shipment every month because I can't live without them. They've also helped in reducing my breakouts. Now that it's so easy to clean my face every night, I do it much more regularly. Perfect for sensitive skin! Great natural cleansing wipe, works well on my combination skin. Not drying. Will order again. Love these wipes.  Non oily an and very very gentle. I love using these wipes because it moisturizers my face so well. Amazing! So gentle on my face yet removes all makeup! I Will definitely purchase this again and recommend to everyone! This is the first time trying this brand, and I love it. I feel my skin soft and clean after every use. I have tried other brands but they always left my skin a bit red and with a slightly burning sensation from all the harsh chemicals. These wipes are the complete opposite. Like any product, reactions may vary depending on your skin type, so do your homework. As for me, I have normal skin, and it has reacted beautifully to this product. One of my favorite brands for make up wipes because of how smooth and gentle they are on the face. The quality is great and does the job of protecting my delicate skin as well as taking the makeup off. Highly recommended! These are great for sensitive skin. My face seems to redden after using many types of facial wipes but these are gentle and non irritating. These are very good wipes. They are gentle and do a good job of cleaning. I use these to remove makeup when I'm too lazy to do my usual cleansing routine and when I'm only wearing light makeup. Didn't dry my face and makes it feel clean with just one wipe. Easily removes makeup Love thses wipes. Good for sensitive skin and i have very sensitive skin. Stays wet and wipes skin clean, even mascara, without drying face. I use it all the time to wipe my makeup off. I use waterproof mascara and this takes it off which is great for the end of the night. Some of the best makeup remover wipes I've used to date A little Pricey but best facial wipe I’ve tried so far. LOVE THEM! Just started using all the Simple skincare products and these are great to remove my make up. My skin is super sensitive and I've not had any problem at all with these irritating my face. Packaging is pretty good at keeping the wipes from getting dried out too. Love these!  Simple cleaning without harsh chemicals. I have these on my subscribe and save.  I love them.  I used to use the garnier ones, but there's a lot of perfume on them, they smell good, but it's a bit intense.  The neutrogena ones REEK, I refuse to use them.  These are perfect, soft, and strong, and they get off all my makeup. I love these! They don't make my skin break out, don't smell weird, and they do a pretty good job at removing my makeup. Mascara can be a little tough, but it does take it off for the most part. Overall, I highly recommend! I love this product. I am lazy at night and don't always wash my face, especially since I work at home and many days never leave the house or put on makeup. I used to have random breakouts and now I don't. I'm not sure if it would or would not matter which brand I used, but I like these for the fact that the ingredients are simple. I have sensitive skin and these work great and bonus even removes all my make up including mascara.  I bought them for traveling, but now they are part of my every day routine. These face wipes are my favorite for myself and my daughter. They are convenient, easy to use, and leave my skin feeling fresh and clean. They are also a great way to teach my daughter about washing her face in the morning and at night. No splashes of water all over the sink and mirror necessary. This convenient twin pack gives us each our own wipes to keep in our separate bathrooms. The scent is pleasant and they are gentle on her super sensitive skin. These are perfect! I prefer them now to Neutrogena. These have a soft side and a exfoliating side and are much bigger! My skin feels much cleaner afterwards. I buy these over and over again. They are wonderful for the price Love these facial wipes! One of the only ones that doesn't break my or my daughters skin out. Not oily. Good texture, will buy again. The only facial cloths I ever use. So refreshing, cleans my pores and had a nice mild scent. Initially I bought these for my 13 year old daughter to wash her face with. She generally showers at night and then needs to wash her face in the morning. She has typical teenage skin that is a bit oily and breaks out occasionally. They are quick and convenient and gentle on her skin. More recently I began using them myself, at night, to remove eye make up and to wash my face. I have more mature skin, tends to be a bit dry, and very, very sensitive. I have had no issues with these facial wipes. They thoroughly remove my mascara and all other makeup and don't irritate my skin or dry it out. Overall I am very happy with these Simple Cleansing Facial Wipes, glad they don't have a lot of ""junk"" in them and they work for both me and my daughter. We have them on subscribe and save so they never run out. These are the only cleansing wipes I will ever purchase! I dont have sensitive skin, but I try to stay from products arent very 'simple' so these cleansing wipes are perfect for me! Theyre good at removing makeup and eye makeup, but I usually use it as a cleansing wipe rather than a makeup wipe. Its great for after working out or if you dont feel like washing your face at night, these are perfect! perfect for sensitive skin. absolutely love this item! and the duo pack is at an incredible price point! no sticky residue. These wipes are fantastic! They make your skin feel so clean and refreshed without making your skin sting or feel very oily. I like that the wipes don't feel drenched in the formula too. They're also good for removing makeup. I would definitely get this again. Simple (ha) no-frills face wipes for quick and easy facial cleansing. I found this two pack for cheaper than purchasing as a single, or in the stores in either quantity, so I of course jumped on it! I also like to take these travelling with me in lieu of my regular face washing regimen. Nice and gentle, cleans well. Love them, cleans the eye makeup easily, leaves your face clean but not dried out, will be a staple in my makeup bag Love these cleansing facial wipes! I have relatively sensitive skin and certain facial wipes cause my skin to be irritated. These make my face feel cleaner and does the job in removing make up without leaving any residue. It also does not dry out your skin too much or feel too oily. I've been buying Simple Facial Wipes for several years.  My teenage daughters go through these like crazy.  They are great for cleaning off makeup or even just a quick cleaning to get off built up dirts and oils.The cloth is soft and they barely have a scent.Over the years I've bought these at Walmart and Amazon and regardless of where I buy them, Simple wipes are always a great deal compared to other brands.  The ""store brands"" we have tried have always disappointed, but Simple Facial Wipes was the one thing all the girls actually agreed on and asked for, and I was okay with that because I can always find them at decent prices.This is the one and only brand of Facial Wipes that I am allowed to buy! Love these!  They work well and are so easy to just throw in a bag or purse! Perfect product for removing make-up,  fast, easy, just the right size non-irritating wipes without scrubbing,  pleasant scent, no oily residue or chemical odor. feels very refreshing and leaves face feeling soft. I highly recommend this product favorite wipes, no irritation or burning and removes everything it needs to These are the best makeup remover wipes, especially for eyes! These are amazing! We love them! These are hands-down the BEST make up remover wipes I have ever used.  Though I don't think they are ophthalmic rated, I experience no irritation when removing my eye makeup at night like I had with the Almay product.  I use the wipes on my entire face and find them neither drying nor oily.  They're great! I have sentive skin and break out really easy. These are one of the only makeup removers that haven’t broken me out. This stuff removes makeup so well! And it's wonderful for my sensitive skin (I have rosacea) one wipe gets my entire face of full coverage makeup. Probably won't ever buy any but these. These are great at removing makeup.  Also have been very pleased that these do not burn or irritate our skin.  We have had issues with that on Neutrogena wipes.  Will be buying more of these and trying other products from this brand. I don't wear makeup, but it works decently for cleaning face after a long day, especially if you got your face dirty.  Convenient. These wipes are AMAZING. I was using the Neutrogena makeup remover wipes before and then received a sample of these wipes on influenster. It works just as well as the Neutrogena wipes, in my opinion, and has no harsh chemicals so I prefer these!! These are very soft. I don't feel like they are scrubbing my face and causing irritation. I can tell that product is removed from my face because I can see the product on the wipe. One wipe took all my make up off which is rare. Also, makeup wipes usually make my skin feel like it's on fire but these feel good and refreshing! I plan on trying more products from the brand They do a great job and its nice to have two so I can keep one in my purse and one at home. I don't use these personally. I buy them for my girlfriend on subscribe and save periodically for my girlfriend to clean her face and remove make up and she seems to like them a lot so 5 stars from me, because a happy significant other means everyone's happy lol These are a must have. I get them monthly on subscribe and save and keep one in my purse and at home...sometimes a spare in my car or office! I use them not only to remove eye makeup, but to clean my face as well; sometimes this takes two wipes but for the price I don't mind!"
B06WLKPBGZ," Great! Packaged nicely. No damage to product.  The oil smells soooo good. Its not as thick as some oil cleansers i've used, but more slippery and thin. Dissolved makeup very quickly, even liquid eyeliner. Follow up with the foam cleanser or my liz earle cream cleanser. I find removes better with a muslin cloth. The extra oil blot sheets was nice too. Possibly the best foaming cleaner I’ve ever used! Just a pea size is all you need to clean off most make-up I except for waterproof eyeliner. That you’ll need the liquid base prior to the foaming cleanser. I don’t plan to switch to any other brands. Affordable and leaves the skin feeling really clean. The foam is mildly scented but makes my face feel clean after the wash.  I'm hypoallergenic and sensitive to most skincare products, but I am not with this. I've been using this for month and so far so good. Skin looks a little better and I will order again I love this stuff, and it came in the mail very quickly I love these two products. Makes my skin so soft. My son has acne and I have him use it also which works great! Thank you so much. I'm in love! I have very sensitive skin and the cleansers I was using didn't harm my skin, but didn't really do the job either. This is gentle enough to use twice a day, but so effective! My face feels clean and refreshed with no wait-the-redness-out downtime afterwards.The oil cleanser is great for pulling off my makeup and the foam cleanser is like silk on my face afterwards. These are my cleansers now. Hands down. Nice improvement over my standard cleansing protocol, and I love the smell! I have a very sensitive, combination skin and most cleansers either make it really dry, or don't clean throughly. After a week my skin condition visibly improved, pores are less visible, skin is smooth and not irritated. Additionally this duo seems very effitient, especially foaming cleanser should last long. First time using it, I love the fresh clean smell and I don't need a lot to use it. Just a tiny bit makes my face foamy. I will definitely order this again. I Iove it.  I like the oil, it is very light. The foam cleanser is also great. I only use a pea size amount for my entire neck and face. Would buy again. The foam is the absolute best cleanser out there!! I've used some of the most expensive lines out there from La Mer to Erno Lazlo. This product imo rates right up there at the top.Thank you Great product"
B06ZYBHPY2," Love this stuff Nice toner I use this on my face due to uneven complexion and mild rosacea (redness around nose area). This is the best stuff I have ever used for my complexion and just wish I would have discovered it 50 years ago. It is a natural remedy and works great for my needs. My wife and kids are all using it now also. I've been using Thayer's for years on my face after I shower. Before I used it, my face was dry all the time and zits happened sometimes, and on the rare occasion I'm out of this toner it's right back where I started. I know nothing of the science behind witch hazel/aloe, but I gather the witch hazel causes your pores to close, which if done immediately after washing can limit the amount of bacteria that may be introduced from dirty towels or hands. The ingredients are simple, natural, and not irritating, and the fragrance is subtle. Does not get better than this. Remember this is a toner, alcohol free. With alcohol it is an astringent so pick the one that meets your needs. Very light and pleasant smell. I will probably never buy another toner. This is guuuuhreat. Witch Hazel is my savior. Really has helped with acne redness! Will definitely purchase again when I run out! Leaves skin feeling clean and fresh.  Love it! Good stuff for post-shave of my enormous head.  Helps prevent razor bumps.  I ordered the Rose Scent on accident, but it actually isn't bad at all.  I still prefer the Unscented version. Great product. Thank you. At first I was upset that only the 3 packs were available. Now im glad I got 3. This stuff is amazing... Within a week I saw all the bumps on my face go down... I actually saw a difference the very next day because I misbehaved and expected new zits but got none. This stuff should run for president. This stuff is like the tacos of the face product world. This stuff once beat chuck Norris in a fist fight. Yeah. I went there This is by far the most gentle and moisturizing astringent I have ever use. I have tried others since and return to this each time👍🏻 I use this every single day on my face. It really gets everything off and it doesn’t dry out your face. I will be buying this forever. My sister bought this product and I quickly fell in love with the way my face feels and the scent is amazing. I have been using this as a toner for almost a year now and I absolutely love it. This product is very gentle and has helped me so much with the redness on my face from acne marks. Please do not change your product. It is a good product for clean skin... I use It to clean my face after using the cleaser. Work great!!! Excellent product not harsh on my skin and helps to clean away the unseen dirt that often remains on our skin after washing our face. Seriously love this stuff. Switched to this to cleanse my face more after face wash and it grabs all the remaining makeup. Great price too! Can also buy at Target I hear. I have really dry skin and using this soothes my skin and keeps my skin hydrated. Works great! perfect gift My all time favorite toner! I love this product This toner is great!  Gentle on the skin, but also refreshing, and the rose water ingredient adds a touch of aromatherapy to the experience! It feels great and smells good! I really like this toner and it doesn’t make my face dry. I haven't tried this long term, but am amazed after using it just two days! Can't wait to continue using it. These smell so wonderful & make my face feel great! The best product to use on the daily!! Got rid of my big pores and acne. PERFECT i love it, i order 3 itmes~~~ Very refreshing! Great product! I tried this originally to see if it would help to prevent the endless red spots breaking out on my nose and it works. But now I have found another great use for it: if you find yourself in a situation where you can’t safely wash your feet because the shower is cramped, slippery, and has no grab bar to hold onto, here’s what you can do: after your shower sit down somewhere & pour a little of this rose witch hazel on your damp washcloth and use it to clean your feet! It is an excellent cleaner and deodorizer for sweaty feet after a long day in thick socks & boots. I’ll be buying more of this because I might find even more uses for it! I'm not the type of person to swear by any one product, especially when it comes to facecare items... but this Witch Hazel thing is absolutely amazing. I've always been hesitant to use toners on my face at all, let alone for daily use, but Thayer's is so gentle (even on my ridiculously dry skin) that I have no qualms about slathering it on every day in the morning and whenever I feel particularly grimy. This product single-handedly squashed a hormone-based breakout before any zits had the chance to bubble up to a noticeable degree! I love it so much, I *had* to give a bottle to my mother--her oily skin is almost impossible to control. It worked on her skin too, even though we have such different facial product needs! It's truly versatile and makes me wish I had found them sooner... my skin is so soft, clear, and even. <3 Adicta a este producto 😍 Great non-drying toner. We use it twice daily after micellar water cleansing and I almost don't need a moisturizer since it doesn't strip skin of natural moisture. Lets just say Im stocking up. Noticable difference with my scarring from acne. Using with a salicylic acid lotion and it doesnt dry me out. Very gentle. My face feels so nice after using it. No breakouts in a while, I think this is helping keep it clear. this product is amaaazing, honestly I didn't bought  it from here but I want to review it. i've been using this for just 3 Days and it's really works, I feel my skin so soft and smooth and beleave it or not it makes my face look brighter in just 3 days.Iam in love with it ,and definitely will buy it again. give it a try and you will not regret. I love this stuff and it smells really good. As expected The scent is delicious yet subtle on skin. Worth every penny! been using this for years it really is a  great toner love this stuff.  mild and smells like roses"
B00IMNI7C0," Excellent product Great price!!!! After just 3 days of use my skin is softer and my blackheads are VERY noticeably lessened. I love the smell and texture. I will definitely keep using this product. I love this product Love this and really anything by Garnier company.  Their products are the best and do what they advertise.  I use this cleanser in the shower for washing my face and am truly satisfied with the usefulness and end result of the product. great face exfoliator but i use it in place of my face wash maybe 2 days a week Like the product and the smell. I feel it does the job. No problem w/ dryness or the product sticking to my hair. I received my facial scrub rather fast and began using it immediately.  After only 3 days of using my face feels amazing.  My acne has died down alot and looks great. Will definitely buy again. Great product. Very good Used this mask twice already and I love it. It leaves skin clean and smooth but does not dehydrate it. I love it. Smells nice and fresh. Works great on my sensitive skin. I had dry patches and breakouts at the same time and after using this my skin looks and feels awesome! I love this scrub. It is what I wanted. I couldn't tell you if it's beneficial in any way, but it smells good and it feels good to use. Seems it's getting harder to find in stores. I really like this face wash. Leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed. I have been using this for about a year and will continue. Very sentive skin and we can use this face wash.  We also like it because it doesn't dry out the face or makes it oily which is so important in face care. Love this face cleaner, keeps my skin smooth, doesn't dry my skin and it is a very gentle exfoliator, i also love how it smells! Fast delivery. Awsome product I really like this product This product is amazing, my skin feels so soft and refreshed when I use this in the morning. I will be buying again. great daily cleanser Good facial cleanser and it smells great. Smells sooooo good and feels great Works great and love the smell. Garnier Clean +Balancing Daily Exfoliator Awesome scrub! Good face cleanser, Yes, just as described. Amazing stuff!!! Thank you Favorite face wash with an exfoliator. I have sensitive combination skin. I use this once a day in the morning. It has a nice smell with light exfoliating. I have this on the subscribe and save to save even more! I really like this, its an effective product. I have VERY picky skin, it's both dry and I have rosacea, and this effectively cleans and exfoliates my skin without freaking it out. Added bonus is the nice fruity smell, easy to smell, not overpowering. My skin feels softer after using it. I love it! Great for combination skin! I only use this face wash in my T zone because it will dry out my cheeks. But this really helps my face stay dry and oil free when I have make up on! I cannot stress how much I absolutely LOVE Garnier products. This is really old faithful for me. I usually purchase from Publix, but it's so expensive there. It costs around $8. But I found it here on Amazon for a steal. Also purchased with the Garnier Moisture Rescue Refreshing gel cream. The combination together does wonders for my dry skin. Especially after just have given birth about a month ago. Pregnancy really did a number on my skin, but this is getting me back I'm a skincare fiend. This is a mild non-drying exfoliator that gives my skin a refreshing feel. I always recommend something with grapefruit to wake up to, I actually feel like it gives you a boost. The beads are soft and squishy so its not too intense on dead skin, but its a great deal for removing makeup and cleansing. Works really well for my 30-something combination skin. Doesn't leave it stripped or dry, and also helps keep oil production under control. The exfoliant this uses doesn't seem to be as harsh as others, for example a popular apricot scrub on the market leaves my skin feeling torn up. This doesn't. It also smells awesome and I love getting the whiff of grapefruit when I'm washing my face in the morning. Love this scrub. A perfect balance for my skin, has never looked better or felt smoother. I've tried many scrubs and cleansers, even those that cost $60 didn't work as well for me as this does. I use in combination with Garnier sensitive skin makeup wipes and Garnier brightening facial lotion with spf Not that I have bad skin, but my friends noticed my skin after using this for over two weeks. This facial wash is a keeper as it works. The pomegranate makes my skin smoother. I've tried the Garnier Hair Color Clean and Invigorating Daily Scrub for Normal Skin, 5 Fluid Ounce but I prefer this one over it. I absolutely positively love this face wash it feels so good on my skin I would definitely recommend this Seriously so good. Exfoliates and deep cleans!!! Love! I had really bad acne as a teen & am blessed with adult acne still at 28, but this has been working wonders. Doesn't make my skin dry after either! It's perfect! Tried this for the first time last night. I love it. The smell is great. My skin felt amazing and my pores are so cleaned out. I was surprised by the potency of this product. Most say they will help to unclog pores, this actually did. Since I only had a sample that I got from PinchMe, I'm going out today to purchase a full size bottle for myself. I'm actually excited about getting healthy looking skin. Just started using this as a morning face wash in my skin regimen. Awesome and it smells wonderful. Leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed. I can see a difference in how healthy my skin looks and feels along with my acne is gone and controlled now. Love it! Since my skin is really oily in certain areas, I decided to buy this product. I noticed immediate results. My skin was lighter and once I dried it with a towel, I could feel smoothness without any oil residues on my hand. Since I wear a lot of make up, this product has helped me control my oily skin. This face wash makes my skin feel fresh & clean. Also, I feel like it helps my face be less greasy throughout the day.  Highly recommended! Garnier facial cleaners are fast becoming my favorite. They are light and rinse well. I always feel like my face is fresh and clean. Great cleanser.  Cleans my face very well."
B01HK83JNO," Great body wash that doesn't leave any scent and it does deliver on cleaning out your pores. Will buy again. One off the best products I use in a long time. I love it. Do you have other items for the skin as well? Strong smelling but works really good my skin feels amazing This product is awesome. I love the rich lather and the softness of it. You do not have to use alot. The only bad thing I didn't like was the smell. But that won't stop me from using it. Love, love, love this face wash. While I was satisfied enough with my first purchase to buy it again, I found the soap's consistency to be runny, making it easy to use too much. The product I received on my second order was of equal quality, but more viscous. AMAZING!!!!!!! Works wonders for blackheads and acne. Works great. My skin is clearer and looks healthier than it has in years. I like American Black Liquid Castile Soap very much, I haven't had it long enough to see if it does what it says. This is a very unique item. I really like it. I find the price to be quite expensive, but so far, I am very happy with it. This is the first charcoal soap I've used and I was worried about skin being dry but Detox combo of essential oils leave your face and body feeling oil free but skin is soft and nourished and not dry and feels soft and clean..  I just bought this for a 2nd time.  I don't have acne I just wanted a a natural deep clean with out chemicals This stuff is amazing. Started clearing up my face after the first time I used it! I have very oily, acne prone skin & this is the best cleanser yet hat I've tried on it. Jury is still out. Within a week of using this, almost all of my blackheads on my face were gone. This is amazing! Makes your skin feel so clean!!!!! I will purchase again! Feels natural, is natural. Doesn't dry out skin but makes it feel clean. Love it. Awesome detox body wash! I have only used this product once but i really like it! Skin feels clean and smooth. Works good Love this product, it has helped clear up acne and my skin feels ""clean"" I really like this detox face wash. Just love it so much I'm ordering it again Awesome product! LOVE it! Love this product.  I have sensitive skin that breaks out easily, and this detox cleanser is great. My face feels tight but not too dry.  It has an earthy, clean smell - smells similar to Aveda products.I follow it with Beauty by Earth Facial Toner with Witch Hazel and Rose Petal Water for face - also from Amazon - and am happy with his my skin feels & looks. Great product. Good face wash that leaves your skin feeling extra clean. A little goes a long way, so this product will last a very long time for me because I only use it for my face. Don't use too much otherwise this will instantly dry out your face No other product has worked as well for my acne, and it has ingredients that I can trust are non-toxic. Perfection!!!!! My entire family has genetically oily and acne prone skin and we tried everything - over the counter didn't work - prescription medicine dried out and wrinkled skin, nothing worked. However, this wash worked like wonders. It makes your skin feel super clean but not dry. It helps with acne and oily spots. We like it so much after our first order that we ordered multiple bottles for all bathrooms in the family. Thanks you for finally providing a great non-toxic non-drying product for us acne prone oily skinned people! LOVE this body wash. It helped so much with my pores and acne. I also have a boar bristle brush, and between the two I have not had healthier skin, plus I use the soap and the brush as a replacement for shaving cream. I shave less often,and my skin is much smoother.I also have been using coconut oil as a lotion, modems Mederma scar cream, and Freeman apple vinegar scrub and mask. Real talk: I purchased this cleanser to help out with a seriously gross skin situation. Due to some medication, the skin on my inner thighs and under my arms became irritated, broken out, and painful.Every soap I tried (Eczema soap, Colloidal Silver soap, Oatmeal soap) just made me itchier and seemed to make the break-outs worse.I've had this stuff for a week and, so far, I feel clean but not itchy, some of the flakiness actually seems better, and the breakouts feel calmer.I'm counting this as a win! Adult acne. Need I say more??I have tried all face washes...even tried accutaine.I didn't want to pump more chemicals in my body as my husband and I were trying to conceive.Didn't get pregnant, but I did get a clearer face!! Totally going to buy more of this stuff. Dosent dry out my face, no weird smells, doesn't stain you towels, and it works Fantastic for those with oily skin.  I use it after shower to wash my face and it makes it squeaky clean. Was looking for something to help clear up my sensitive skin. I read about this face wash on a blog and found it here on Amazon. I couldn't be more pleased with the results! I've already purchased a second bottle. I have struggled with body acne since I've been about 12 years old -- so, about 16 years. I'd taken every medication and topical under the sun except for Accutane. Anything with salicylic acid as a primary ingredient would only make me break out in cystic acne, and benzoyl peroxide would dry my skin out to an extreme and bleach all of my towels and clothes. My skin's oily and sensitive makeup has only been minutely cleared  by products that are well over 50 bucks a pop, and I can't justify spending that much on a product that doesn't have a size larger than in an 8oz. container.On a whim when looking through related products to the expensive one I'd been using, I came across this and decided to give it a shot.Wow - - I have not been disappointed. I can't remember the last time my skin has been this clear on my back. Any angry or developing acne that I'd had was shriveled and disappeared in a matter of days. I have to stop myself from touching my back skin because I still can't believe how wonderful of a job it has done!I realize this sounds like a corny testimonial, but I'm telling you, if you have problem bacne, give this a shot. This is definitely one of the best purchases I've ever made. Wow!  I love this cleanser!  It definitely pulls out all the yuck.  One of the ingredients (which I use separately as a mask) is Bentonite clay.  This clay alone draws out all the positive charged toxins. I suggest not wearing rings or other jewelry (hoping the manufacturer has done the same regarding the metal) because bentonite clay acts as a magnet to any positive charged toxins. If metal is touched the clay mixture it no longer works. Anyway that's enough about Bentonite clay. There are a lot of great ingredients in this one bottle.I use this wash twice a week in the shower from head to toe. I can feel it pulling the yuck out of my skin (especially the face) almost a tightening, but not like when a mask dries.  It's a good feeling reassuring me it's working. Once it's on I rub in circular motions all over my body and face. The first time I used it a few pimples erupted the next day, but that's another sign it is detoxing the skin.  I just put a dab of zinc oxide paste on the pimples and they dry right up and disappear.  I definitely recommend adding this wash to your detoxing regemine. I couldn't be happier with this products results. Wonderful Detox Face & Body Wash.I LOVE How This Wash Freshly, And Deeply Cleans My Body.As I Shower With This Body Was,. it seems to Up-Lift My Mood!It Smells Like Fresh Minty Herbs.NOTE: That This Body Was is very Thin, and Watery-Like, so be very carefully while handling it becauseyou don't want to get it all over the place.This Body Wash Works Amazingly With My Skin.NO irritations, NO Yeast infections.In Fact it works well on cleaning your Gentle areas before and after being intimate.It has ACTIVATED CHARCOAL + BENTONITE CLAY to Gently Exfoliate + Pull Toxins from Congested Oily Skin6 Pure Essential Oils to Tone and Clarify Skin - Fight Acne and Promote Healing.Great for Oily Congested Skin from sweating, acne, black heads and back and chest acneDirections:Use Daily in shower and bath for face and body with problem areas like back and chest. If you aren't getting a high-foaming rich and emollient lather, you are probably using too much, so start with a small pea size amount. If it's gel-like and not foaming, you're probably using too much!And This Body Was is Perfect To Use After a Hard Workout!I LOVE IT!Thanks! :) This face wash is amazing! I don't think I have found one that works this well. I started seeing instant results. The first time it tingled a lot, I felt it working on clearing out my pores. Amazing! My breakouts are minimal to none now. My skin stays pretty clear using this. Definitely would purchase again. As someone whose suffered from acne since I was 12 (I'm now 45), I've searched for a product that really works to help clear up my skin. Now, with concerns about the negative effects of aging, the chances of me finding the holy grail that works both to clear my acne and not dry out my face, were slim to none. In fact, I'd given up after trying thousands of dollars in products. Then I found this gem!! Wow!! I cannot express how thankful I am for this face wash. I pray they never stop making it because I never want to be without it again. It improved my acne immediately, and although it feels a tad bit dry after I use it, within the hour that feeling is completely gone... and that's without moisturizer. My skin now has that hydrated glow and my makeup looks so much better too! I was a little disappointed at the size of the bottle, but that's only because I was erroneously expecting a bottle the size of a standard body wash. However, it takes very, very little to clean my entire face and neck... about a dime size, so I expect it to last quite awhile. It removes facial makeup easily, however, you'll still need to use an eye makeup remover if you use waterproof mascara and eyeliner. My face feels so clean and I'm extremely impressed with the results! Please, please, please don't ever stop selling this! I absolutely love this ""facial wash"".  Incredibly refreshing! This soap goes a long way. Just a very small dab will be enough for your face. I actually use this as a body wash to wash my entire body. It is very refreshing and feel amazing. It smells incredibly good. So refreshing. It makes my skin feel soft and moist. It lathers up very nicely. A nickle size dab will  lather up enough to wash almost your entire body. Two nickle size dabs and you can easily wash everything. Unless you're extremely dirty I guess. This is a healthy wash made with all natural products...and my body can tell. I will definitly order this again. Highly recommend this wash! Really happy with this. My face is one giant oil slick and this has been a savior. Other ""oil reducing"" face washes seem to just dry out my skin and then my skin overcompensates with MORE OIL. Not the case here. Skin is smooth, moisturized, and have definitely had less breakouts. Only nitpick is the smell. Frankincense is not my fav but it doesn't linger on your skin. Only have to use a little so bottle is very much worth the price. I purchased this product a few months ago and didn't use it right away, because I had other body washes/face washes that I wanted to use up first.  Boy do I regret that!  I absolutely love this product.  First I was sold from the list of ingredients, all natural and no chemicals. It has a very clean and fresh scent and your skin feels so clean and moisturized after using it.  This product is also effective yet gentle at the same time.  This replaces my face wash, body wash and feminine wash.  I can use it on my entire body with no worries. The bottle looks small but the soap is very concentrated and gives you a good lather without any sulfates.I will definitely be purchasing this item again. Nice scent, lathers well, The bottle should last a good two months.  Pleased with purchase. Will purchase again. Exceptional customer service in that they want to ensure customer satisfaction.  Thank you. Love how I feel cleaner than when using bar soap or body wash. My face runs a little on the oily side and I like this because I can use it on my face without drying it out. It is very gentle and doesn't sting at all which I was expecting a little with the tea tree oil. One unexpected side effect is that I feel like it's also made me look a little younger with the way the ingredients tighten pores on my face :) I have never found a face wash that works so well on a consistent basis for my adult acne as this one. I went on a business trip this past week and I forgot this face wash, so I was using another one for the week. My face looked horrible! Once I got back home, I immediately washed my face with Detox Face Wash and I could feel the oil and dirt lifting. If this is ever discontinued, I will be looking for the owners and paying them to make my own special batch. My skin is the best it's ever been I'm never going back. I have problem skin oily t zone, mild acne at 22, African American hyperpigmentation acne scars issues. My skin is always smoothed and cleansed a noticeable difference in acne and scaring.Note that I do use this in conjunction with spin for perfect skin and a combination of squalane olive oil and madhippie vitamin c oil religiously. I was searching for a new face wash that would leave my skin feeling fresh and clean and also help with  my breakouts. I am 30 yrs old and have always had acne prone, oily skin. This facewash makes my face feel so fresh and clean! I have been less greasy and my breakouts have diminished. You really only need a little tiny bit of this, it goes a long way ! One little dot works on my face, my back and my chest!I am using this in conjunction with the Insta Naturals products and my face feels bright and clear. I purchased this face and body wash since I was looking for an all natural solution for my back and upper arm acne break outs. They aren't to bad but I am very conscious of it. I am a pretty active person and spend about 2 hours a day conditioning. I have been using this product for about a week now and the acne breakouts are almost completely gone. The natural cleaning/ anti fungal properties that this face and body wash are very apparent. Definitely a huge fan. My second time buying this.  Great stuff really keeps my skin clear. I've been using this as a body wash to treat adult body acne for about a month now. I love the way it makes my skin feel clean but not dry, it has cleared up existing acne and seems to be preventing additional acne from developing. I also love the scent, kind of like black tea and pepper. I'm definitely going to continue to buy this product! Soaps up great and doesn't make my skin itch after showering. The soap has a slight scent but isn't noticeable to others around you. So far it feels good after showering. I only used it for a week but so far my skin feels good and I like that its suds up good without using a lot of the soap. Time will tell. I use this after gym workouts, helps controls body odor naturally. A little goes a long way, very pleased, will buy more. love this face wash! i have hormonal cystic acne and it has improved greatly. Not overly drying. I purchased the Detox. It has a wonderful blend of ingredients. The aloe vera gel (helps to soothe irritated skin) coconut oil (antibacterial and antifungal properties) with activated charcoal and bentonite clay (gently pull toxins from the skin) sounded to wonderful to pass up. I love castile soaps and my experience has been that they do not produce many suds. This soap with all of its wonderful ingredients suds and has a mild scent. I would have thought that the scents of the ingredients would be competing with one another. I actually thought the scent would be prominent as soon as I opened the bottle. I use this body wash in the shower with exfoliating gloves. It works will. It cleanses gently and rinses clean. It leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturized without any feeling of residue. I am happy with the way this body wash cleanses. I am glad that the scent is light and fairly neutral. This has helped to clear up my skin better than anything else.  I have been very happy with this product and I definitely recommend giving it a try!  It’s my go to product to keep acne at bay!Adding an edit about the safe house naturals customer service, they are excellent and super fast to respond. The smell is pretty bad, but it works very well! I've tried almost every acne face wash on the market. From Clean & Clear to ProActive and nothing ever worked. I use this twice a day, followed by witch hazel for toner and my skin looks better now than it has in years! This wash is amazing for me in the summer when I get super sweaty or after a gym session. Love that it's natural and makes me feel fresh and clean. This soap worked great on my entire body including my face. Was a nice addition that it is free of any of the bad chemicals that are typically put into every day soaps and face washes. MY face felt clean and refreshed after using it, but not over dry, as did my entire body. Although I did not pay full retail price as part of me receiving this soap at a discounted rate, I will be purchasing it when I run out. The only con is that I wasn't aware it was a concentrated formula, so I diluted it in an empty soap dispenser I already had. I'm sure it says that somewhere in the details of it. But that wasn't enough to say it wasn't a great product still and give it five stars This face wash makes my face and body feel extremely clean! I normally have acne on my cheeks and back with flare ups during different times of the month, but this wash has helped control how severe the acne is. It did not take it away completely (I did not expect it to as nothing solves my acne issue), but it is one of the only products that showed results within one month of using it! Plus, it lasts a very long time if you use it properly. Overall, I will continue to buy this product as long is it is on the market :) As someone who never writes a review, I felt the need to write one for this product. I received it last week and since then I've used it twice a day. I've used it on my face and body. My skin is almost clear. That includes acne that was growing, present and acne scars (old and new ones). I have been getting giant cystic acne for months now. Something I haven't gotten since HS, I'm in my 30s now. It was getting really bad and until last week it wasn't getting better. Thank God for this product! I feel like a human again! The only thing I'd say is it leaves my skin a little dry. Use a moisturizer after. holy crap ... was not expecting this soap to be this good .. only used for 3 days .. the acne around my hair line and chin are gone .. my pores on my nose are much much smaller and clear ... i am impressed .. thank you to the vegan friend that posted this on her page ... thank you!!!! Nice smell. Doesn't irritate my highly sensitive skin on my back, chest/torso. Also, use it on my face, which is SUPER DUPER sensitive. No irritation yet, which I can usually tell after a couple hours, whether I'm allergic to a product. A little goes a long way (I use a dime size for my face, quarter size for body on a brush/loofah), lathers very well. Seems to be healing my blemishes quickly, without over-drying my skin. Worth giving a try. The best for oily, acne prone skin! This review is for the DETOX soap. First, a little goes a long way so that's a plus as the bottle will last a while. It foams up really nicely. While on it tingles and just feels like it's pulling out all the bad gunk from your face (as I have quite oily acne prone skin). I definitely felt clean afterward but not overly dry. Clean and refreshed which is a plus. Be careful not to put it around your eye area or it will sting!I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. Have tried many products and this is the best. Works great to clear my adult acne and my sons teenage acne I had stubborn acne and have tried a lot of products. This seems to be working. The fact that the company gets in touch to make sure you're happy with there product is also very important to me. So will definitely highly reccomended and definitely buy it again Not sure about the long term effects of this but I like it a lot so farSmells kinda like tea tree oil and leaves my face feeling tight (in a clean way) which are both good things My teen struggles with acne. I got this soap for him and it made a huge difference. It didn't completely get rid of it but WOW what a difference it made! This is my week 1 review, I will do a second week review if anything changes for the better or worse. I use this for my face and have mild breakouts, before I started using this, I used Proactiv for over a decade.The first day I used this, I made the mistake of using way more than I should have (a few drops the size of a nickel) which left my face feeling dry, even in the shower, after rinsing off. Fortunately, it did not dry my skin out during the day.The second day I used a lot less, like 1/4 the size of a dime, you REALLY don't need to use a lot of this stuff, it is POTENT. I suspect this bottle will last at least 6 months, if not longer.It has now been 7 days since I started using this (once a day during my shower). The first couple days, I did have a breakout on my face which I don't normally breakout on, but they cleared up (or are clearing up) very fast. I read that breakouts are to be expected when switching cleansers, so I didn't worry too much about it. This stuff leaves my face feeling much cleaner and less greasy during the day. My skin also looks a little better than usual. I will definitely be buying this again, eventually, since this bottle will last for a VERY long time.UPDATE:It has been about a month and a half since I started using this and my skins still looks and feels great! And the best part, CLEAR! After a mild breakout for my first couple weeks of using Detox, (as with any new skin product) my face has gotten used to it and is now clear. NOWHERE ELSE will you find a better product for this price that will last SO LONG and have NO HARSH CHEMICALS. I would buy another bottle, but my first bottle is still over 3/4 full!1 year update. I last ordered this on Jan 4, 2017. I am just now ordering a second bottle. My wife and I both use this on our faces daily. Absolutely love this soap, my daughter has rosacea and acne on her face that never seems to clear up, with one time of use the redness and veins were gone after a couple days all the acne has gone away it is works wonders, I am so grateful I have tried just about everything for her with little to no success Great Product.  I've been using the face wash for 3 weeks. My skin is softer and my acne is under control.  The face wash works well for my sensitive skin.  After using the face wash, my skin is clean but not tight or dry.  I will definitely buy again. Amazing Works on blemishes and although I have very sensitive skin it does not react. Skin looks healthy. very good wash for hormonal acne, gentle enough to not irritate, but gets the job done:) works really well with my clarisonic Activated charcoal rules!  My wife had this mega zit that would not go away for almost a year.  Several dermatologists, several meds and nothing worked.  This stuff flattened it in 2 weeks! Where have you been all my life? I have been using this face wash for about 5 months now and I could not be happier with the results. I am in my mid 30s and my skin is very oily skin and very sensitive. I have always struggled to find a face wash that will address both issues. I used to buy multiple products and alternate them every other day but now I use Safe House Naturals Detox twice a day without any issues. I religiously wash my face 2x a day with Detox and I haven’t had a breakout in 5 months. My face feels so clean and soft after I wash my face & I also notice that my face produces less oil throughout the day. Plus, I also love that this product is biodegradable and not tested on animals. This was a huge selling point for me. My only complaint about this product is that the pump tends to clog. To be fair, they do tell you this on the back label but it is still annoying. 1 bottle lasted me abut 5 months and I just reordered. I highly recommend this product to anyone. Seriously, this stuff is amazing! Best face and body wash I've ever used. Leaves your skin glowing! Seriously, there are very few products that I love. This is one of them. This is my first time using this product and I love it! I love that its sensitive enough for my face and body. It's also made with essential oils which I love! I plan on buying it again. Have tried similar products, but this one is going to be my favorite. This stuff works.  Most acne treatments don't but this is like no other.  I highly recommend this product!!! If you're having trouble finding something to help you with your acne like I was then this will be exactly what you need! I have been getting body breakouts from working out and the summer heat, this wash has really helped clear it up! Really makes my face feel squeaky clean without over drying it. This stuff is amazing. Just after one day I am seeing a difference in my skin on my face. Great product. You only need a little since it's so concentrate The best product I've tried for my adult oily adult acne prone skin. My favorite face and body wash. Awesome! Smells great and my skin feels good. Such an amazing brand, highly recommend! The real deal when it comes to sustainability and natural products. I absolutely love this product. I was looking for something to cure my husband backacne and after week of use I am happy to report about a 90% minimal reduction. We are truly happy with the results. This product is amazing. I love the smell of this soap. The active ingredients are the same as I normally use on my face. I really enjoyed this soap. I tried everything to clear up my son's skin. Nothing worked, until a friend recommended this- amazing transformation. Cleared my son's skin in less than a week. I am so happy to see him confident again, and his face literally glowing! I love this tried it because my skin is sensitive and it said its good for sensitive skin and it is actually helping and not making it worse. Amazing!  I wasn't sure about it but it cleaned so well. The aloe is soothing and it gets off makeup and grime. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
B00PFEFAXS," I was worried that this may dry out my very sensitive skin.  I use Retin A 1%(always wait 30 min after any ""acid"" base face wash before using retin A) nightly, and this worked wonderfully! It doesn't lather a lot like most skin cleansers do, but it's enough to remove dirt and oil on skin. A reviewer mentioned this not removing eye make up.  Um, that's what eye make remover is for.  Mascara, eye shadow, eye liner are very hard to remove with ANY cleanser.  This helps keep skin clear, and shrinks pore size. ;) I had been buying this from big box retailers for a while and found that I could put it on Subscribe & Save, and one less thing to worry about running out of!  I have combo skin (oily nose and forehead, while slightly dry rest of face) and find this cleanser perfect for both my face and neck, along with arms and other areas that I want to cleanse but not have drying effects of soap.  I HATE the feeling of most cleansers that feel like I have artificial moisturizers so I feel greasy!  That is why this is my new cleanser and I hope they don't discontinue it for many years to come.  (I also recommend Garnier's gel moisturizer which I had been using longer than this cleanser!) this is a great facial wash. does not leave any residue and the price is perfect. does not break me out and cleans my skin very well. I love that it is for sensitive skin as well. I have purchased multiple bottles of this and will continue to use. Really great. I love it. My skin is hyper sentive but I wear a lot of makeup for work to cover up redness. This took off all the makeup and let my skin feeling super clean but no burning. I have sensitive skin and this gel is great.  No breakouts, cleans well and skin feels soft after. Love this cleanser!  Removes makeup easily and has a cooling effect.  No film.  Rinsed clean.  I love Garnier products  and their quality and how inexpensive they are compared to other products I have tried.  Less breakouts too. I always use this since I have very sensitive shin and find it cleans my face nicely. Exactly what I've been looking for,  I like this formula better the  the product they released to replace it. Have used this gentle cleanser for some time, and especially happy with its low sudsing and non irritating features.  Will continue to use and order. Can't find it at the drugstore anymore, so glad you are carrying it. Nice cleanser with no drying. Cleared my face up and a great value! I have been using this for the past few years. It has been getting harder to find in store. Cleans skin without over drying and I love the Matt finish. No matter what I try, I always come back to this My favorite cleanser ! I can use it over my eyes to get rid of mascara, gel liner and excess lash glue. Doesn't irritate skin or my eyes. Gets every last bit of make up off. Great product Really like this product! Feels good on my skin and removes all my makeup. This is the best for my dry and very sensitive skin. Will order more. Doesn't make the skin dry and removes makeup gently too! Perfect combination. Highly recommend this product. My skin is very sensitive to products and I've had no negative reaction to this product This removes my makeup perfect! I have to do 2 washes but I wear a lot of makeup! I like the feel when using product. I have reordered twice. I really like this product. Gentle but effective Excellent, even for men great cleansing gel I swear by this cleansing gel. It removes troublesome waterproof mascara without burning my eyes. I have dry, sensitive skin and this has made removing my makeup a much more pleasant experience. I have noticed a significant improvement in my skin since I added this to my daily skin-care routine. I use this every evening to remove my makeup, and am so happy with it, I plan to purchase this again, and again.I have tried many different products, from high-end to other drugstore brands, and cannot tell you how happy I am with this! I am older but have oily/combo skin. I made the mistake of using Retin A (prescribed by MD) a few too many days in a row. I was left with sensitive, red and peeling skin. Actually, everything I normally used proved too irritating for my face. So I decided to try this cleansing gel. This is called a gel but it has a more milky appearance and was fragrance free. It does not foam but took off waterproof eye makeup without tugging. That surprised me. It did not strip my skin but also did not leave an filmy residue that creams usually leave. I was not tempted to wash with my normal skin cleaning gel afterward so that should say a lot! I will continue to use this and highly recommend it is worth trying at this price point. This is my favorite makeup remover. It's an unscented, non-foaming gel. Easily removes all makeup including mascara, doesn't dry my skin out or leave any residue. Doesn't irritate my eyes. I was buying it at Walgreens & recently couldn't find it, one of the staff looked it up in their system and said it's being discontinued! Love this cleanser!! I put it on my dry face (even eyes) and breakup all the makeup. Then go in with a warm wet washcloth and it really gets off all the makeup! Also great for my Beauty blender! Lately can't find it in stores. Hope it's not being discontinued.....I have very sensitive skin, and man this works so well! I have very sensitive facial skin and I am prone to breakouts. I also can have very dry skin. This is the only cleanser that doesn't cause eczema on my face and it also doesn't cause breakouts. It's part of the routine that finally cleared up my adult acne. I love that it is simple and inexpensive! This facial wash is AMAZING.  After having a birth control implant put in I started to get pimples on my face, neck, and back.  Since I began using this product, within two weeks, my pimples were almost totally cleared up!  I love it and will definitely buy again!  Also, a little bit goes a long way. I have combination skin dry everywhere except for my nose which gets congested and oily very easily I wanted a cleanser that can remove my makeup and cleans all at once and this is it its very gentle it's removes face and eye makeup like a charm it doesn't dry out my dry areas but it also really help decongest my nose it's has zinc and a small amount of salacylic acid I have been only using this for two weeks but in obsessed my skin has never looked so good and so clear it's perfect I definitely recommend I really like this one way more than there lotion version I didn't like that one at all I bought  this at Walgreens  it is amazing, take all makeup Away,  gentle in my eyes im getting  some more soon"
B005JM94BK," great price and shipping on this product. thanks Love Mary Kay's face cleanser. Great product and I received it in a timely manner! Love MK products. I have tried many cleansers and I always find myself coming back MK. It is absolutely worth the money you spend. I find my complexion is brighter and it doesn’t have any harsh smells. I've been using it for at least 15 years and cannot live without it to wash my face daily. Pair it with the moisturizer and you will soon be hooked like me! :) Love this cleanser. Been using it 2-3 years. Wonderful face cleanser for sensitive skin! love it I love this Nary Kay Cleanser and have used it for years. I have been using this for few years, I just tried something different, I did not see the cleaning that I got with my Mary Kay, wont make that mistake again, my face started breaking out, and that's a sign it's not getting clean, so I went back to my 3-in-1 cleaner, it gets my face clean, and I don't get the breakouts, like the way it makes my skin feels afterwards too, it works best with Mary Kay other item the moisturizer, I would recommend this item highly, I will not be trying anymore different cleanser again, staying with what works!!! Wife liked the Xmas present.  Really hard to buy for, but this worked ok as a stocking stuffer. Perfect, thanks! My favorite facial cleanser. Each time I try to change, I go back. Best face wash ever. Always use this. Always will Huge fan of Mary Kay! Moisturizer does it's job. My face is at its best with their products. Thank you Love this cleanser. It has three in one action. Makes my soft and clean. Love I have used this product in the past and have no Mary Kay agent nearby.  I am so glad Amazon carries Mary Kay products. It is easy to order and the pricing is competitive. Great cleanser Have tried other well known products, but Mary Kay is the only one that does not make me break out in a rash.  It really has helped my skin to look smoother.  Highly recommend Mary Kay Timewise Cleanser Really like the product for my skin. Love this product Item arrived on time and was as described Great cleanser and gentle to my sensitive skin.  I have used Mary Kay products for years now and just love it! ANYONE WHO HAS NOT TRIED THESE PRODUCTS, YOU ARE MISSING OUT!!! I HAVE BEEN USING MARY KAY FOR ABOUT 10 YEARS & I LOVE IT!!  NOW, THAT I AM 40 SOMETHING, I SEE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR SKIN. This makes my skin soo soft and healthy, it also adds a little glow to my face. Very light scrub but does WORK! Will never buy another cleanser again. Been using Mary Kay for decades. Love the 3 in 1 and the moisturizer with sunscreen. good seems to be just fine but have only used once I've been using this cleanser for a few months now and it's great! Cleared up some of my acne and keeps my face soft. It smells good and is not abrasive. Always loved it! MK never fails to agree with my skin. This cleanser is a soft cream with good scrubbing power. Excelent works Used Mary Kay for many years I've ordered this for years and will order again. I love this cleanser. I won't use anything else. excellent arrival and product! I have used Mary Kay skin care all of my life, and have been using this product specifically for years. Was due for more and this price was great. Product came new in package and shipped quickly. This is great for people who have dry skin. perfect cleanser for normal skin. removes most makeup ( not mascara). Leaves face soft to the touch. Love this product.  I have used it for years.

I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a line of product that actually works. This line does not have a cut off age group. Love it!

My package arrived safe and quick. I bought this for my grandmother cause it's cheaper on here than through the MaryK lady, Grandma likes good deals.

Keep up the good work! Great price. The best cleanser there is. Best cleanser, gentle Love Mary Kay products and this is one of the best cleansers I have found.  I ran out and used another brand from the local store but was not really happy with the results. I have very sensitive skin and have tried just about everything on the market. I absolutely love Mary Kay's 3 in 1 cleanser. My skin has never looked healthier. no more breakouts, ever! No more uneven skin tone or redness, doesn't leave skin to dry or to oily. I ordered through amazon for a whole lot cheaper than buying from a Mary Kay consultant and received my product about a week later. Always love this product.  Gives a youthful look to your skin.

Gentle and kind to my aging skin Great product, fast service I usually use combination/oily formula but since it's been so cold, my skin has been drier because of heat running more often. This has worked well and feels great! Great product excellent product superb service I have had difficulty with other washes until finding this Mary Kay product. The product I purchased were cleansers and it works wonderfully. This is the best facial cleanser.  I especialy like the type for dryer skin in the winter months; so easy on your skin, but thorough.

Very pleased Love this product.  Been using it for 20+ years. Great Mary Kay is the best! Great buy, will purchase again Just as I expected ! Thanks ! Mary Kay Cosmetics is something that I have used for years.  The 3-in-1 cleanser helps save time.  Thank you for such great service. Received the item as ordered within a reasonable time. Very pleased with it. One of my all time favorites.  Will order again. This is by far one of the best facial cleansers I have ever used. And trust me, like most women, I have used plenty.While it doesn't appear to do much at first, it does a lot over time. When I use this facial cleanser day and night my skin stays perfectly clear all the time (even during those beautiful times of the month).The smoothness of this product is really nice and I love the tiny,gentle exfoliating beads as well.Make sure you know your skin type, though. I had used the Oily/Combination skin cleanser from Mary Kay as a backup cause I had ran out of my Normal/Dry skin cleanser and the Oily/Combination cleanser made my skin feel very tight and rather dry. When I use the Normal/Dry skin my skin looks and feels perfect though.Could not be happier:) Just what I was looking for! Have used before and love it. Will definitely order again. I just love Mary Kay. Great stuff!  I'll use it till I die! This is a true Marykay product with all the benefits of cleansing your face. Good stuff --- I like this product from Mary Kay,I use it sometimes at night before I go to bed.It cleans your skin really good I've used Mary Kay cleanser and moisturizer since I was 24 years old. I am now 70 years old and over the years I have continually received compliments for my skin - and amazingly I still do! :D Oh, in case you are wondering if I am a Mary Kay Consultant - no and never have been. I have had my own career as artist and graphic designer and loved doing that work, but I do highly recommend this product. good On my face.  It keeps the wrinkles low  & the skin soft and clean and shinning.  I like it a lot Would highly recommend this product.... Completely satisfied I love this cleanser!! After you use it, my skin feels so clean. If i run out and use something else for about a week and then come back to this cleanser, I can really tell a difference in my skin. It's a must buy! My favorite cleanser of all time! My wife loves this stuff! She has been using it for at least 10 years. My girlfriend loves this cleanser. It's really helped! I have been a long time Mary Kay customer, and will continue to do so.  Being able to purchase this product online is much more convenient than trying to find a MK rep. Okay, so i didnt really like this cleanser first time, because i thought i bought the wrong product accidently.i threw it away for like a few weeks until i found this blog post . i read how oil cleansing can actually do better job cleaning those disgusting oils clogging our pores. cleaning oil with oil. so i took out this one again, tried it for last few days.this time i didnt complain about how greasy it is, how weird smelly it is, and how it feels like a makeup remover rather than a cleanser. ( ive used cleansers that actually make you feel like you washed off something from your face. which most of the time dried up my skin,,) i was afraid the oily texture would actually lead to pimples and breakouts by clogging more pores. but ! it worked soooo great.reason why i recommend this product is :: im in late twenties and was worried about wrinkles. somehow my skin gets oily too and i have breakouts with any new skincare products. so, i looove this cleanser since it doesnt dry out my skin, and once you get to use it properly, ( take time to rub it thoroughly because these little beads inside the product will remove your dead skin too , without scrubbing every now and then, i usually have white scaly skinaround my cheeks) it really does wonders. im glad i accidently bought this product now loli came all the way to leave this comment to save one more wrinkle- prone skin of all the late twenties!! I've been using this cleanser for many, many years and at 73 years of age, my skin seems soft and free of a lot of wrinkles that I bet I would have were I not using this Mary Kay product.  I must say I love this cleanser and defoliator. It cleans without drying and gets my skin ready for applying moisturizer.  My skin is never too dry nor is it ever oily. This tube lasts a long time, as only a small dab is needed for smoothing onto my facial skin.  It rinses off very readily with plain water. I used Timewise a long time ago because a friend was selling Mary Kay products. Lately I have noticed my face feeling ""cruddy"" and I was trying different scrubs I have at home and nothing seem to help. I even went and got a professional facial and my face felt dry and after a day it was cruddy with a thick layer of dirt that won't come off.I ordered Timewise because I remembered that I had liked it many years ago and now just one application takes away the thick layer of dirt and if I use the rotating brush for a few seconds my face is so smooth and it lasts the whole day and the next day it has little accumulation of dirt. I won a free facial by a Mary Kay Rep. and received a free moisturizer. I did not expect it at all, as I'm really picky, but I LOVED it so much, since it moisturizes REALLY well all day! (I have to admit though, I use other, natural moisturizers underneath as well, but the combination with Mary Kay works REALLY WELL!)SINCE THEN, I'M HOOKED; so I purchased other products, such as lately this cleanser on Amazon. Again I'm completely amazed, how well it works! Of course I would not use it if I'm totally dirty or need to remove lots of Make-up, but always in the morning and often evening I do use it! I'm amazed, how my skin has IMPROVED! It DOES cleanse very well, yet this type of cleanser cannot remove all makeup, but a normal day of dirt on your skin! It does a better job than I ever have thought! It doesn't have harsh chemicals, is gentle and yet works really well! (I know I sound like a rep, but believe me, I'm an amazed costumer!)Before, I was always using Clean Clear but now since it is soap free it doesn't dry out the skin, yet cleanses REALLY WELL TOO! It is also a scrub, cleanser and toner 3-in 1 in my opinion, so no other products are needed! My skin has SOOOO much improved! I'm really impressed; another amazing product by Mary Kay. My skin is more even, more moisturized, shiny it really glows more! I never thought I would like the products, but I prefer this so much over Avon; why; no penetrating smell, doesn't feel like harsh chemicals and these products really work! I have used Mary Kay's facial products for 35 years.  I am 66 years old and I have had consistently beautiful skin and very few wrinkles!  This product is always in my suitcase for I only have to use 1 product vs. 3! Makes my skin feel smoother I have been using Mary Kay Timewise for over 15 years and love it!  The 3 in 1 Cleanser feels so good on my face and the scrub leaves you with a real cleansed feel.  I have tried other products and came back to the Mary Kay Timewise 3 in 1 cleanser.  I would recommend this product. I just started using Mary Kay for the first time in my life about 4 days ago. I am 25, just to say. When I was on birth control for years, my face was SO clear, never had a breakout, but when I got off of the pill, my face broke out SO bad, I couldn't even go outdoors, I felt awful about people staring at me. I bought some expensive skin clearing regime kit at Ulta, never worked, then bought Proactive that everyone swears by and that didn't work either, so I finally bought Clinique for acne prone skin and that failed as well. Mary Kay was my last option, and this 3 in 1 is the BEST face wash I have ever used. I kid you not, my face was so broken out, and yesterday (day 3 of using this product) my face is clear!!!! I used the 3 in 1 moisturizer right after the face wash as well. HIGHLY impressed and so grateful that I found a new face wash. Thank you Mary Kay!!!!! I wish Mary Kay would use a finer grind of abrasives in this cleanser, I'm older & it stays under my eyelid flaps. Other than that, like it.I love the ease of having it sent to me. Product is fresh & quickly delivered. I never liked using soap & water on my face because I usually get the suds in my eyes. So through the years I always used some type of cleaning astringent or lotion which I applied with a cotton ball. One day I decided to try Mary Kay Timewise 3-in-1 cleanser. It's a lotion with a few scrubbing particles mixed in. I didn't think my face would get clean using a lotion so I was happily surprised when it did. It's easy to apply, just wet your face & neck, rub a small amount of lotion around, then wipe it off with a damp washcloth. Follow up with your favorite moisturizer. Voila! Clean face & neck without soaping up.I've been using this product approximately 6 years. It never caused me to break out. I should mention that I don't have sensitive skin.I forgot to mention that the appearance of my skin improved when I started using this 3-in-1 cleanser & Mary Kay's Timewise moisturizer. I didn't use any moisturizer until I began using this cleanser. I have been using this cleanser since I was 18 yrs old, and literally ANY other cleanser makes my skin ruins my skin.  Unfortunately, if you are not a Mary Kay consultant (I am not actively selling it anymore), it is $18 a bottle!  I am in two weddings in a couple of months, and I needed my skin to get clear right away.  So, I decided to take my chances with buying the product from someone online.  Thankfully, it's my tried and true cleanser!  It was delivered to me in three days or less!  It started working right away, as expected.  I had no problem at all with the packaging or delivery or the product itself.  Thanks so much! I will probably be back for more when I run out! Love MK and have used their skin cleansing products for over a decade. This cleanser is so creamy and moisturizing it's amazing!! I have dry skin and am well into my 40's so the last thing I need is something that is going to dry out my skin even more. This is perfect!! The beads that exfoliate are very gentle and gently burst where needed to cleans and exfoliate exactly where your skin needs it to. Thank you MK for making such a great skin cleansing collection, I am a forever user!! THIS IS THE BEST TO KEEP YOUR SKIN CLEAR. IVE BEEN USING IT SINCE MY TEENS AND PEOPLE THINK IM TEN YEARS YOUNGER THAN I AM.  I WENT OFF IT FOR AWHILE AND I HAD MASSIVE BREAK OUTS, EVEN PROACTIVE DIDNT WORK MY FACE WAS A MESS. SO I WENT BACK TO THE MARY KAY AND MY FACE CLEARED UP IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS I love this product and I'm happy to be able to purchase it on amazon. I have dry sensitive skin and this is gentle enough for me. It exfoliates my skin so it doesn't look so dry all the time. It is also made for dry skin and when your done cleansing it feels very soft and clean.I highly recommend this product. I love this cleanser, and this price was cheaper than getting it locally.  I use it up so fast, I'd love to get it at this price.  I hate that MK has gone up on their prices, but finding this was a great surprise.  I also do not have to deal with local pressure to sell.  MK reps, some people just want to buy the product!!  Get off their backs and stop trying to build your pyramid.  Instead, build your business.  These reps selling on Amazon are doing just that.  Glad to have found this product here. It is high quality and needed. Mary Kay products I have been using for many years. Thank  you. I love the basic 3 in 1 Cleanser and have used for years.  It is a must for me and I am very glad that I can order from Amazon, receive and use. Mild, exfoliate for those whose skin gets dried out from traditional face washes. I've been using it for years and its been the best i've ever used, hands down. Compared against, CereVe, Cetaphil, Nuetragena, Nivea and others. This is the best makeup remover on the market. Highly recommend. My granddaughters love it too. Always borrowing mine.  Lol Have used this product for years.  Love it! It's a staple for me. I've been a Mary Kay user since for 24 years and this stuff is fabulous. No wrinkles, no crows feet, no laugh lines and I give the Mary Kay skin system credit. Love that Mary Kay!!  Been using it for years and will continue for years to come! Exelente make-up remover without having to carve the face everything removes it arrives in time and in good conditions want it I use this a lot. I use Estee Lauder for my face and spent over 500.00 but I am one to buy a product I know that works for what I am looking for. Mary Kay runs a close race as a cleanser I'd rather have this than the Estee Lauder and thinking to return everything I have bought as their serum is very potion and never had an issue with any products of Mary Kay and much cheaper and this cleanser has a sand feel cleans deep into the pores! Makes my face super smooth. I use this with the Mary Kay moisturizer and it clears up my dry flakey skin. Didn't buy any Timewise for an extended time.  Once it arrived and after less than a week my skin felt and looked better. I have used Mary Kay all of my life.  I am 52 and I look 30.  Seriously.  I swear by good hygiene and taking care of your skin.  This is a number one product. Have tried many products and always return to this. Nothing is better. Received quickly and in perfect shape. I've used it for years. Good product. I have normal skin. Because I don't have oily skin, I find that cleansers often dry my skin. This product lightly exfoliates without drying. Great Does not sting my eyes like most of them, easy to use, great little crystals in the cream that do an extra scrub.. NOT drying.  last a very long time, easy to travel as it is in a tube.  Best cleanser I have found so far.  At 67 I have tried alot! Another I like that has the crystals,is Olay which is considerably less expensive. It is in a white bottle with pump.Your face is very smooth and helps soften the skin when you use a cleanser with crystals or whatever those tiny sand like particles are called. it also help loosen dry skin and tends to flush it off somewhat-I will keep buying this product. I have used Mary Kay products for years, and this basic cleanser is a great staple product.  Good for everyday use and won't dry out your skin. wife orgered this. I use the Timewise bar cleanser for daily use and only use the tube of cleanser when I'm traveling (wet soap is hard to pack!)  I find the bar lasts a LOT longer than the tube, but for traveling this is perfect!  It would be good to keep in a gym bag, as well. I find the Mary Kay products work well on my skin.  I do switch off between Mary Kay and Clinique as I enjoy the Clinique products also. I have used this facial cleanser for several years.  It is the best facial cleanser I have ever used.  I use it daily.  Mary Kay makes excellent facial products. So....I've had super oily skin since puberty...I am now 27, and this is the best cleanser I have ever used. Two times my boyfriend nagged me to stop buying such an expensive (in his male opinion) cleanser and so I bought a drug store brand to replace...Mistake. I'm rebuying it right now because after 4 weeks without it my skin is breaking out like crazy in this heat and I need this back in my life. love it Wife loves MK, and this is one she can't do without :-) Love this product for my dry skin This is a longtime favorite for me. Doesn't dry your face out and gets it smooth and clean. doesn't take but a small amount unless you are taking off makeup. the seller was good and it was packaged well. I got it very quickly which is always a plus when I am ordering online. My Mom Came Over with a Travel size gift bag of Mary Kay Products and So I tried the Timewise 3 n 1 cleanser and I have dry skin and I'm telling you not only did it work my skin was a lot softer and I started getting compliments on my skin and people kept asking me What did I do . A little does go a long way and I used it to the last drop . I definately have used other products but none of them does what this cleanser does def. ordering the whole set! Good Have been using these products for 35 years and I still have found nothing that works any better even though the costs of these other ""expensive"" products far exceeds Mary Kay!  Buying ANYTHING else is a huge waste of money.... This is great stuff. My face feels awesome after using it. I use this product every day.  It removes makeup and leaves my skin very soft and clean.  Even when I do not need to remove makeup I like the feel this product gives me.  My Mary Kay rep. moved and I love that Amazon has this product available through its many stores - at less than the original price.  Will buy again.  Seller was quick, package wrapped well and delivered before expected. Love the creamy texture. I use several Mary Kay products and like the way this one moisturize my face. good product for those of us over age 50 Love the product.  Use it everyday because it works. I am very happy with this.  The price was what I was looking for. I will always use this cleanser. It is wonderful. So nice to have shipped quickly. I have used Mary Kay products for over 40 years and timewise cleanser ever since it was introduced. Great Product - You Can Buy On Amazon Mary Kay products are my 'go to' line. I have used this for about 10 years. Have used Mary Kay products for years.  This scrub is an easy product to use, in fact I use it when I shower. Have used  Mary Kay for years. I have tried other products from time to time, but always come back.  Only negative is finding a MaryKay consultant that doesn't give up.  Thus, was ecstatic to find it on Amazon. The best for cleaning and softening I use this product all the time.  Good pricing  by this supplier. I was  disappointed to discover Mary Kay discontinued their extra emollient creamy cleanser, so decided to give this a try. As much as I prefer the latter, this product works pretty well too. Smmoth I've tried lots of cleansers. Most end up being too harsh after a few days leaving my face blotchy and dry. Mary Kay Timewise 3 in 1 does not.  It hasn't caused dry skin or breakouts.  I use it with my Clarisonic and it works great.  I love ordering this from Amazon as I don't wanted to be bothered with a rep. Mild daily cleanser I loved the 3 in 1 cleanser Love it, and have used this product for years.  Thanks Good stuff. Very satisfied with this product. Love it This Lotion really clears my face...Some say,It makes you look younger""Without wrinkles"" Use it all the time. Favorite cleaner The bottle will last you a long time since you only need a small amount. Leaves face feeling silky smooth which my man loved!!! My face used to break out about once a month but using this has stopped that from happening. The last bottle I had of this lasted almost a year (no joke) so it is worth the price. Have been using Mary Kay cleansing products for over 40 years with no complaint.  Best blonde brow pencil I have ever found. I love this product and use it daily.  It cleans very well and with the Time/wise Moisturizer it keeps my skin looking good.  I have received many compliments about my youthful skin, which any woman loves!  I nave trusted Mary Kay skin products for 30 years. This is as always , unique Good product. I love this stuff. It has done things for my skin like no other. I will continue to forever use it. love this product. Been using it for years and have had many compliments saying I look like I'm in my 40s. I'm in my Late 50s Just as described, new in box. I have used this product for years and haven't found any other product as good A good cleanser - it has a light exfoliate in it. I would recommend it. I have tried a number of different facial cleansers - some inexpensive from the grocery store (Oil of Olay, Neutrogena, Aveeno, etc), others nicer (i.e. Estee Louder). The 3 in 1 Mary Kay cleanser is by far my favorite. Most face washes dry out my face, however, this one does not.  It leaves my face feeling clean and moisturized. I have fairly sensitive skin that is irritated easily; I have no problems what so ever with this product. My skin never dries with this 3 in 1 Mary Kay cleanser. Gave as a gift. I am an older woman with likewise older sun damaged skin, thoughI have the lucky Mediterranean genetics.  Mary Kay cleanser is gentle, thorough and very little is required to get a clean face.  Can't be without it as I learned when I ran out. As described, satisfied with it Had no ideal that this product was on Amazon.com until it pop up, I was having a problem with a seller for Mary Kay and went to look for another one and this pop up.  I so happy about that, much cheaper so far the product appears to be the same, thanks. Great Product. Great Price! This is my newest ""Must Have"" product. As an AA woman, I have always struggled with uneven skin and since starting heavily working out over the past 6 months I have felt like I could not get rid of a few trouble spots on my chin line. I tried other products first and ended up with a dry, peeling face that was worse than before. I ordered this product along with the moisturizer and also use Aveeno Pure Radiance Moisturizer with SPF and my skin is clear and even and I haven't had a break out in 2 months!!! I will absolutely reorder! You will never use anything else again to cleanse with, once you use it. Prices are the  best for this product on Amazon. I recently got this from a teacher of mine. I have moderate adult cystic acne, and had been zapping it with every acne product I could think of. She suggested this, sine my skin is apparently dry. I've used it for a week (with a non comodogenic moisturizer after) and the acne is clearing up better that anything I've used. It doesn't make my skin feel ""facelift tight"" after using either. So far, I really love it! No new acne, and with quickly healing scars and old acne...it's really amazing:). Fast and easy to order on amazon. Love Mary Kay cleaning cream Received so fast - will be ordering again! Love the cleanser...especially in summer! It really makes a difference in my skin. If you have a tendency to get dry..this isn't for you though. Love this item ! Love this Great product and quick delivery. Didnt know Amazon carried Mary Kay LOVE IT!!!!!! I've used alot of different products and this is my favorite. It mealts away your makeup and leaves your face soft and shiny and Clean. Makes my skin smooth! I received a bunch of Mary Kay products as a gift and decided to try this out instead of my usual face wash.  This worked well.  I have mixture skin like most people and this 3 in 1 did a great job without leaving feeling my skin too dry. Everyone knows Mary Kay is great!  I have used for years! It makes my skin feel so young! Try it! My mom likes it so, if she's happy so am I. Arrived fast and at a fair market price. Works great! Love, love, love Mary Kay.  Such a noticeable difference when I use it.  And the price on Amazon is lower than any sales rep that I would normally get it from.  I will definitely order again. All Mary Kay products are good for me and have been using them for many years.  Easy to use if you have any reaction to any cleaning products.  Highly recommended I use this morning and night and it leaves my skin feeling amazing.  Before using this I just washed with water and dove soap or body wash.  I would always feel dry and wake up in the morning with very dry skin that required me to put some cocoa butter on my face to renew the moisture.  This cleanser is all i need now before my moisturizer (mary kay timewise age fighting moisturizer for normal to dry skin).  The combo is perfect!! I have used Mary Kay skin care products for more than ten years. It's  the best product which help me to clear all blemishes on my face within 6 months. I used the full line of skincare products. Have used this cleanser for long time it cleans your pores Love this This cleanser cleans my face leaving it smooth and soft.  I have been using this product for many years and really depend on its results."
B004IX45GK," Love the product will buy forever. Face always looks & feel better Bought this for my boyfriend's son to try out. When I asked him if he liked it, he said ""Yah"" and when I asked if he liked it better than the other ones I'd got him in the past, he said ""Definitely."" Not the most descriptive response for a review! So I gave it a try during my regular morning routine! I have dry/sensitive skin so I started just trying it on my nose. It had a nice, creamy consistency. The fine bits of pumice and coconut shell powder gives it a nice texture for exfoliation. The shea butter made it feel amazing to both apply and wash off.There is a slight pleasant scent that comes from the essential oils but nothing feminine or overwhelming about it. I personally love that it's a cruelty-free vegan product. It's a winner! We'll definitely be buying this again! I use the product at least 2 times a week (overtime I wear heavy makeup). My skin is very sensitive and this face wash is perfect because it doesn't contain artificial colors and synthetic fragrances. after I scrub my face, I usually leave the scrub on for 3 mins for the essential oils to be deeply absorbed into my pores. Bulldog keeps my skin clear and refreshed. The feeling my pores get after I use the face wash makes me feel like I just left the spa. Everyone compliments me at work saying my skin is glowing so I could not thank this product enough for finally giving me the results I've been striving for with other products. This little miracle is absolutely worth recommendation and at such a reasonable price, everyone should own it. Nice and clean!  Works well and you need just a little bit for great results.  Lasts a long time.  Cheers! Was looking for a some skin care products that #1 work well; and #2 did not break the bank.  I purchased the Bull Dog Eye Roll-On, Moisturizer, Facial Cleanser, and Face Scrub.  All of the products have exceeded expectations; and are well worth the money.  An excellent value for excellent products! Does not irritate my super sensitive skin, yay! The scrubbiness is very mild. This product does a superb job without irritation or strong smells. The natural ingredients and neutral smell are great. This scrub has made my skin clearer and smoother. My blackheads are gone, and my skins is soft and fresh looking. The only draw back is that I have to hide the bottle because my wife steals it instead of using her expensive products. For the price and the result though, I don't mind sharing. It's an excellent and affordable product. I had a friend recommend this face scrub to me after I mentioned others I've used have left my skin feeling dry or irritated the skin.  This one leaves my skin feeling fresh without the drying out effect so many others face scrubs I've tried had.  I also really like the scent of this face scrub, it's pleasant without being overpowering.  As an added bonus Bull Dog advertises itself as a Natural Skincare Product which is great because many of the others contain components that irritate my skin.  I had no problems with skin irritation whatsoever when using this product. I'm totally pleased with this masculine skin care product.  It has a gritty property that functions to exfoliate the skin, leaving it feeling and looking fresh.  It is easy on the face but also thoroughly cleans, leaving a faint hint of a woodsy smell that is gentle but not overpowering like some products with a strong aromatic after smell.  I am pleased to have discovered this product. Bulldog Original Face Scrub 3.3 oz This scrub is greatness in a bottle.  The first time I used it I was blown away with how well it worked! The exfoliation in this product does a great job at fighting acne and blackheads.  I noticed a real difference quick.  Also I use Lush Ocean Salt which goes for almost $25 a jar, and I can say that this is just as good or maybe even better for the price.  My suggestion Try it out if you are looking for a good exfoliating scrub because you will not regret it! I'll have to give it more time, but I've been using it twice a week for about a month now. While I haven't noticed the BIGGEST difference, I do like that it leaves my face feeling fresh and helps get rid of any impurities before I shave, and it's helped cut down on cuts as a result of shaving. Really good scrub for your face.  I used to buy Neutrogena all natural face scrub but it was thin and watery. Bulldog is thick, full of abradant particles, and doesn't run on your hands or face. It makes my face much less oily and greasy. Big fan of Bull Dog products. The face scrub is slightly course so it does a great job exfoliating and afterward, I follow up with some Bulldog face lotion and my face looks smooth and great. Finally a good facial scrub! I used to use another brand i would get at my local drug store, but it isn't made anymore, it used walnut shell pieces for the scrub. This one uses coconut pieces and it works very good. Decent smelling scent, seems to exfoliate the skin well and doesn't cause me any adverse reactions or skin irritation. I have using Billy Jealousy for some time now and just felt like I needed a change. Can't even remember how I found this but the whole product line is great. Love the fact that it's natural ingredients with essential oils. Love the beads and washes off clean. Now I wish they sold it in larger bottles. You can’t go wrong with bulldog products! They’re made with natural ingredients that won’t damage your skin over time! I love how clean my face feels after a nice scrub with this product! A little goes a long way so the small size of the bottle will still last a good amount of time (assuming you face scrub twice a week).  It works great, my pores have been a lot clearer since using this face scrub.  It doesn't dry out or irritate the face at all either. Great product. Finally, a no-nonsense scrub.Easy to use and unlike other scrubs it does not leave an artificial smell.  I enjoyed the true clean feeling it accomplishes without leaving my face feeling dry and more importantly, it does not leave any oily or greasy residue.  Your face is left clean and it drys to a somewhat matte sheen.  I highly recommend this product. This facial scrub has very good ingredients for your skin!  It is rough enough that you actually feel it working but gentle enough that it does not harm your skin.  I have been using it since 12/16/17 when I received it and as of today I feel as if I can already see the difference. Love it so far.  Fragrance is good, texture is good, and it's left my skin feeling very soft.  Will have to see how it does over time, but so far, so good. Great great product.  One tube this size lasts me about 9 months, keeps my face clean and blemish free! I love this product, i am a girl and i use it as my regular scrub. i see no reason why girls should be thrown off by the company marketing it to men. the scent is not masculine in my opinion... and its not like you would smell it after using it anyway. . it has a very mild scent, and it makes my face feel clean. i don't use it every day, maybe two or three times a week... i use it 1 or 2 times a week. love it. it's kind of light on the abraisive part (the pumice), so sensitive skin is no worry. smell's bland. i like that. perfume on my face pisses me off. This product really works very well. It doesn't irritate my skin and my skin feels really smooth afterwards. Best of all, a little goes a long way. Overall, really great product. :-) just enough exfoliative power, cleans my face well without making it feel like it took all the natural oils away.  Also one of the few with no nuts which im allergic to.  Smells Fresh and nice will buy again. Really awesome product - love the texture on my skin, and it leaves my face feeling great afterward. Very happy to have found such a quality product at this price. Love a great value. Smells great, isn't harsh, a face scrub that isn't full of plastic. I approve. Makes me look and smell great, but also feel great. I love it! It is a great product that actually works. After just only a couple of uses my face got clearer and more moisturized. Usually I have this dry skin problem around my nose so I always have to use lotion. Bulldog is truly a man’s best friend. With natural ingredients this scrub makes my pores nice and clean and leaves my face feeling fresh. It’s perfect because it’s all-natural and doesn’t smell like any chemicals or perfumes. I also really like the little scrubbing beads that make me feel like I’m actually doing something rather than just rubbing something on my face. Definitely will buy again! I bought this scrub to help get rid of the acne on my face. Nice smell and works very well. Does not cause any allergic reactions or other problems. Wish the bottle was a bit larger. Would recommend to friends! This scrub is good. Exfoliating is wonderful feeling combined with the Wash and Lotion Great product, fast shipping. My face looks and feels so much smoother and clearer after exfoliating with this gentle face scrub. The consistency is nice and thick, and it's packed with natural scrubbing ingredients like pumice and coconut shell. It has a light, clean scent that's actually really refreshing.My skin is happy! I was looking for a facial scrub after my girlfriend said my face my yearning for it so I stumbled upon Bull Dog. The name is what attracted me and read a few positive reviews to give it a shot. The product turned out to be great for my facial needs and really takes away the dead skin that's left behind on a daily basis. I'd recommend to any guy looking for a first time scrub. actually enjoy this more than some of the other facial scrubs I have tried/used over the years... One of the best facial scrubs I have used. It doesn't get watery and it works a good lather with beads and doesn't strip your skin. Def will be buying more for the rest of the year. Id advise using this 2-3 times a week. This stuff is perfect.  It smells good too.  Other exfoliators were too rough. Great scrub, leaves your skin feeling fresh and soft.  This is one I will order again! This stuff smells and feels great. It's a bit thick but it smooths out nicely once you start scrubbing. Don't need a lot to get the job done. Great men's product, just ordered my second tube! My husband loves this stuff! Highly recommend! The scrub does a great job of cleaning off dirt and helping remove surface acne. A tip for usage is to use your hands to massage it in and use an a little more than a pea size of it. Works very well. Love this product. 5 stars. Exactly as described. It works. Probably the best face scrub I've ever used. You can tell from the scent of Bull Dog products that they use high grade ingredients. The face scrub is no exception, resembling same scent as their face wash. The texture is thick like a paste with bits of grit. Wow, this is awesome. When you apply it it smells so good. The beads are also pretty small so it doesn't feel like it's scratching your face off Great face scrub, love the smell.  Just ordered another. Great stuff Really solid face scrub.  I've used a few different brands in the past but none have had the right balance of grit like Bulldog.  I'm also a big fan of no animal testing and the lack of sulfates and parabens in their line of products. Good stuff. Big fan after a couple weeks of using this. It's about medium on the gritty scale, but leaves my face very smooth feeling. Always good to have a natural product that does it's job and I would suggest it to anyone else looking. Once a week and you'll see the difference. Big fan of Bull Dog products. Smells good... ""earthy"". Skin feels smooth after using, no issues here. If I don't have this with me my face doesn't feel right.  MUST buy, this stuff is the best! Nice and exfoliating Great Product. Has a nice beat and you can dance to it. This product does a great job.  Elise my face feeling clean without Making it too dry I use Apricot Facial Scrub on occasion just to get rid of rough patches and try to smooth things out. What I didn't like so much was the perfume, so I looked around and decided to try something that, hopefully, would work the same but not be quite as smelly. Bulldog Face Scrub actually works just like that. It feels similar to the Scrub but is a little smoother and the scent is very mild and neutral. I was impressed that they managed to make something with a great smell that was subtle, and still had the ingredients to help my skin look its best. I will continue to use Bulldog for my skincare needs. Good stuff works well Among its dozen natural ingredients, I appreciated pumice the most as I lathered Bull Dog Original Face Scrub across my face after priming it with warm water. While rubbing the Scrub into my skin in gentle, circular motions I could feel tiny grains of pumice rolling over me. I imagined this is what triggered the exfoliating effect of the Scrub.The remaining elements: an assortment of oils, coconut shell and shea butter I reckoned really penetrated my skin after the pumice had done its work. I appreciated how the Scrub lathered just enough for proper lubrication as well as how it did not rinse away too easily--demonstrating the quality of its oils.The after-effect of this Scrub is as pleasurable as it is to work it into your skin. My face felt cool and smelled good. Using Bull Dog Original Face Scrub is an ideal way to start and end my day. Trying to find good skin care products as a man can be tough. You need products that do a good job, and don't rob you of your dignity. This product is amazing, I have only used it once so far, but it was that great. The scrub is not to light nor thick. It has a great scent and has a bunch of natural ingredients. When i first used it, my skin didn't feel tight, and my skin was smoother as well. It wasn't expensive, and right now is a Prime product as well. I will be trying their other products as this has me sold. This stuff 👍🏻 10/10 I wish I had known about this product sooner. It really is a great value for what you are getting. It has about the same natural ingredients as other high priced face wash scrubs and believe me I've been through too many to find the right one. It has a little grittiness as you rub it on your face so you know it's doing it's intended purpose to exfoliate. Post wash, my face actually feels great. There is no scent though because there aren't any synthetic fragrances, depending if you like a scent or not. It doesn't matter to me though because I only care about the results and the results are refreshingly good. Wish this product was more easily accessible so I wouldn't have to order it because yes I will be ordering more as it is not that large, but then again for the price and value, I can't really complain. I really like this scrub. The smell is nice and natural. I would recommend this highly and plan on buying it again. Was pleased with the results. will consider buying it again when out. the ingredients are acceptable along with the price. Love it I have used face wash in the past but it often made my face feel overly tight and would sometimes cause its own blemishes when used once a day. I use this product once a day and I have noticed the difference, my blackheads on my nose are gone and my skin feels nice and smooth, Only downside is I touch my face more since it feels so nice.I do put some mosturizer on after my shower in the morning but without it I dont get that same tight feeling that I would get with the previous product I used.The smell is almost non-existant so I am happy with that as most facewashes smell either feminine or of chemicals, I also like that the ingrediants are easy to pronounce and read.I will buy this product again. My husband loves this stuff. Great product.  Love the smell and texture.  I have not used Bull Frog before but will definitely try other items I'm a woman and I realize that this is a man's face scrub, but I have to say it works wonderfully on my face.  I have tried numerous facial scrubs trying to find one that wouldn't break out my face and this is a keeper.  It cleans and scrubs the skin while leaving it moisturized.  Also a plus for me is that it does not have a heavy fragrance. Great I'm a Boxer guy but this Bulldog is here to stay, good dog. This is for a single pack of scrub. Just the right amount of scrubbiness.Bulldog face scrub has 8 essential oils, pumice, coconut shell, rosehip oil and shea butter to gently exfoliate the skin. Wet face with warm water. Massage a small amount of face scrub gently into the skin and rinse well. Bulldog does not contain parabens, sodium laureth sulfate, artificial colours, synthetic fragrances, or ingredients from animal sources. This face scrub is something serious. It doesn't have some big, fancy smell to it. However, it does exactly what you need it to do: clean your face and prevent ingrown hairs.This scrub is thick, and has minimal smell to it. This product will definitely be part of my routine going forward. I'm loving all the Bulldog products that I have. Really like this facial scrub.  Some complain about scent but I like it.  Smells very natural and clean.  Leaves my face feeling clean and smooth. Will buy again Great, always makes me feel clean. Great natural product! Love it This product is great. I've used it before and had a wonderful experience. I personally recommend this item. I enjoy this."
B01NAC5K3S," Reliable product! Smell really good and makes your skin clean and soft nice and not over drying. Awesome product. I definitely feel that my face is clean and oil-free after using this. I absolutely love this face wash. I got it as a sample after purchasing a previous Korean beauty product and I had to get the full size right away. Immediately after using this I could already tell there was a difference -- my skin was softer, brighter, and most of the small bumps on my face were minimized. I use this everyday and I even bought one for my friend who struggles with acne because it's that great. Good product. I would recommend to buy this product"
B004O292A4," I use this facial cleanser and am really happy with it. The first time I went to rinse it was a shock as I thought it wouldn't be water soluble like cold cream. It rinsed off and left my face feeling wonderfully soft and clean. The price is hard to choke down but you can always start selling the products yourself and get them cheaper or sometimes free. I LOVE this product so much, best face wash I have ever found!And as someone who suffers from overly sensitive skin and breakouts for over 15+ years, it is safe to say I have tried SEVERAL brands and treatments. Many trips to Sephora, many online purchases filled with hope, etc.This is it, it has transformed my skin completely to have skin like I always have dreamed of.I've been using it for about 4-5 months now and it is still just as effective as when I first saw results.I still have some sensitivity and breakouts in my skin but I know a lot of that is due to this winter weather and stress, but the face wash has really minimized it to be nothing to upset me over. Love this cleanser! It is very light and smells awesome. It leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed. A little goes a long way. It's very gentle on my skin, which I love considering I still get adult acne. With the combination of this and some essential oil face creams I recently made I'm very satisfied. My skin hasn't had any breakouts and it's looking better than it has in years. I will definitely buy this again! Absolutely love this cleanser, the blend of oils works great for combo skin. Does a great job of protecting against shins too. I've tried so many other face cleansers but none compare. A little goes a long way too. Great facewash good price Good price This cleanser is perfect for my sensitive, combination skin. I am 40, but still get blackheads, unfortunately. This cleanser keeps my skin feeling very clean, but not stripped or dry like acne-type drugstore cleansers do. The consistency is a very creamy-white gel, and a very small amount goes a long way. I wear mineral makeup and eyeliner, and this cleanser is gentle, but takes off all of my makeup very easily. It is definitely worth the price, and a container of it lasts me for at least five months (I use it once nightly, and only wash with water in the mornings, so for those who use it more than once a day, of course it will not last quite so long). I am sensitive to fragrances, and the smell of this product is actually extremely mild and pleasant. I love it, and have tried to go with other products that are cheaper, and have always come back to this one. lovelovelove, works so well for my skin my face feels so fresh after use This product did nothing for my acne, but it makes my skin feel soft and nourished. This is one of the only products that performs well for me as a  complete and gentle cleanser. I love it!  Makes washing my face so fun!  Love that you use it on dry skin THEN RINSE OFF!  PRETTY COOL! I like this product very much, I use it with my Clarisonic. Pleasant texture.. Fresh .... Respecting the Ph... Wonderful product I have been using this product for years. It is a great gentle cleanser. so great love this stuff! Doterra has a really great facial line going clears up your skin leaving it glowing! Love it! It's the second cleanser in my regimen! Great healthy face cleanser. Love it! very fast delivery seems to clean face well Perfect - love this product wonderful product firms skin over time Face feels so soft. I really love this product. doTERRA is such a great company and their essential oils are so pure, you can really tell the difference in quality. This face wash is GREAT for oily skin. i have combination skin and I wash my face with it only once a day, because it can be too drying; HOWEVER, I follow up with rosehip seed oil as a moisturizer and it works wonders. My skin in so clear and radiant and I only have to wash my face once a day. Thank you doTERRA :) I am blessed with ""combination skin"", super oily t-zone, sensitive to parfums and synthetics, acne prone with dry splotches everywhere. Ive been a loyal Mary Kay user since middle school (15 years), and every time I have tried to switch cleansers my skin has freaked out. Have to say this product is the most similar to the MK ""Deep Cleanser 3"" Ive ever found. Its a creamy opalescent deep cleanser that makes my skin feel super clean without feeling stripped. No synthetic fragrances if you are super sensitive to that!Just leaving a review for anyone who is considering this product, please be aware and research thoroughly before purchasing through amazon. Many products are knock off, and can be dangerous. Great product!  I received this product in the mail yesterday and couldn't wait to use it.  My face and throat feel cleansed, refreshed and the feeling lasts for hours.  I love it - can't wait to get the other skin care products that are a part of the set.  One other thing that I especially liked is that one need only apply a teeny bit of the product for each use so one tube should last a long time. I have used this for approximately 4 years now and have no plans of switching cleansers. It is not drying, a little goes a long way, and it has a wonderful light scent that is not over powering. The tube lasts a long time! Excellent product. Much better than bar soap. Love this product!"
B0031KJP7K," love it Excellent product arrived quickly. wonderful product, good deal!!! I absolutely love this product. Moonlight Radiance has improved my skin tone, evened my complexion, and has overall made an amazing improvement on my skin. I use a small amount on my face and neck at night and use the Merlot Moisturizer in the day and in the few months I've used it my skin looks and feels so much better. This is the best night cream out there. I already use the Merlot moisturizer. Wonderful! I found this originally with Amerimark and glad to see it available on Amazon. Very good night cream that is not greasy. a wonderful,, hard to find cream Purchased for my Mother. She seems to like it. Just what I knew it was.  Been using it for a while now. Been using for quite some time and it works best for me. Expensive too, very hard to find nice bargains. Lovely, smooth, and non-greasy. I LOVE THIS MOISTURZER.  SINCE MY SKIN IS VERY DRY, I USE IT FOR DAY AND NIGHTTIME.  HAS A SOFT SENSE AND I TRUST THE INGREDIENTS.  YOU'LL LOVE THIS PRODUCT. Best moisturizer I have found! I use it twice a day, just a tiny bit goes a long way. Great for neck and chest area too! This night cream feels great on my skin.  In fact, I love it so much I'm going to ask if Merlot packages it for a body cream. In combination with the other Merlot products......I am seeing great results. I enjoy using this cream.  It has a nice smell.  And it's not greasy. Love this product and have used it for a couple of years now.  Walgreen's doesn't carry it anymore in my area.. I really like this as a nighttime moisturizer.  It absorbs really good into my skin, and leaves it really soft and smooth. I have been not using it long enough to see any miraculous effects on my skin but I absolutely love it anyway because of how it smells. I use it on top of my Retin-A cream and I did notice my forehead wrinkles diminished but it might just be the Retin-A. It does leave my skin very soft and not oily (I have combination skin). My cats hate it though, I seriously considered smearing it on my jute curtains just to keep them away. I purchased this night cream and would recommend very nice Amazing! Smells good and has a warm tingle. I woke up looking fresh and my skin felt so smooth. Will buy again I'm loving this night cream! Just started using it not too long ago, but already have gotten a few very positive comments about my skin being so soft and smooth. Not greasy, easily absorbed and great smelling! Even if I hadn't gotten any compliments, I would still buy. A bonus for me is that I'm allergic to pretty much everything and anything (sad), but this cream hasn't caused any of my allergies to flare up. I first discovered this product during a promotion at Walgreens where they offered buy one get one free.  The cashier caught me looking at it and she said a lot of her customers really liked it.  So I bought the night cream, esp since I noticed it contained Argireline (muscle relaxer) and Matrixyl3000(elastin synthesizer) which are two ingredients known to do what it claims.  I've come across a lot of moisturizers, but this one went on creamy, without being stifling or oily.  Having patchy dry skin, usually the cream will obsorb unevenly, and my driest parts continue to be dry after the cream evaporates, as though its water.  This one didn't, I continued to feel moisturized.  And in the mirror, my skin looked even and not patchy in coloration.  It's inexpensive, $20 at Walgreens when not on sale.  And it doesn't have a strong perfume-like odor that's irritating.  In fact, I would describe the smell as citrus-like and pleasant.  Now I don't want to use all my other face creams, which I feel I'm being wasteful, but all I want to use is Merlot. This is the best night cream I have ever found at any price.  I love this stuff!  It's made from grape seed oil, which is also my favorite cooking oil (although hard to find in some areas).  It goes on smooth with no clumping and just makes the skin feel like new. This product is my favorite night cream. I've many tried others...but a lot of them felt heavy or thick on my skin. When i go to sleep, I want something light-- and this cream fits the bill. It's light and smooth but still moisturizes. I honestly love it and it's now become part of my nightly routine. You won't regret buying it! This is one of my favorite night creams. I have used this before ordering it on Amazon it makes your skin so soft, it's not expensive and smells nice too. My skin is dry and the Merlot has an instant remedy after it's on my face. I really like using it. Hope this is helpful! Nice light night cream.  Does not clog pores.  If you have oily skin this is very good. I have terribly sensitive skin.  I have tried ALL KINDS of facial products, but keep coming back to this one.  I am 29, and since an ovarian issue about 6 years ago my skin is crazy sensitive.  All you have to do is look at me wrong and my face breaks out!  My favorite face cream WAS from Benefit - then they discontinued it.  The secret ingredient - I SWEAR - is the SQUALANE.  I was on vacation and my face looked awful.  I went to a Walgreens looking for a different moisturizer, and noticed this one had squalane in it.  I decided to give it a try.  I calmed my skin, and now it actually looks good.  I use La Therapie face wash, and this day and night.  I have noticed a definite improvement and my face actually looks great!  I have tried other face creams since it's been hard for me to believe that a $20 cream can be this good.  Even the $100 creams can't compete - I always come back to this.  Try it, I highly recommend.  On my 3rd tub. I know it says 'night cream', but I use it ANY time my face feels dry. I've even put it on under makeup. It's not greasy and absorbs good, yet leaves my face feeling soft and moistened. A nice light smell, if any. Highly recommend. I love this product. The combination of the moisturizer and night cream have given me the best completion I've ever had. I've used Merlot Moonlight Radience for years! I love it. Face feels clean & moisturized, never greasy. I received it ! Thought I didn't but it wa in the box with the shower dispensers and must have slid under them ! Wanted to clean the bathroom really really good before I used the dispensers so hence not finding the cream! I am so very sorry' so far or feels good on my skin ! 😃"
B01BHAT7PA," My favorite cleanser. It removes waterproof makeup, and my skin isn't irritated at all. A good product at a good price. Arrived on time and in perfect shape. This works amazing do recommend and will order again A great duplicate for High End designer makeup removers. Great. I absolutely love this product. I can hardly find it in stores. But amazing. And as always fast shipping. Probably the best makeup remover I have used I've been a huge fan of E.L.F. cosmetics for a long time. Everything they make is wildly inexpensive without looking or feeling cheap or low quality. And I do mean wildly inexpensive; most of their original makeup brushes are $1 - $3, and most of their original line of makeup is $3 - $5, but none of it feels or works like the kind stuff that you find in 99 cent stores. In fact, a lot of beauty gurus on YouTube and Instagram use E.L.F. products regularly in their tutorials, and those are people who definitely have access to ultra high-end cosmetics!  This skincare line is a little pricier than their other offerings but still pretty reasonable, ranging from $3 for a sheet mask to $14 for a bubble mask, with everything else falling in the middle. I love the packaging, which is all a soft, pale blue-green with simple lettering that evokes a soothing spa-like atmosphere. I love the way it looks just sitting on my bathroom shelf!  The name of this cleanser grabbed my attention immediately; I was intrigued, and wanted to know exactly what ""gel melt cleanser"" would do, and how well it would get the job done. Its a clear, thick gel that has no fragrance, which is excellent news for people with sensitive skin. It works just like traditional oil cleansing, with no foaming or lathering agents, which is excellent news for people with dry skin. And it rinses clean, taking makeup and dirt with it without stripping any moisture from your skin. Which is excellent news for everyone!  I've been using oil cleansers on my face for several years and I really love how well the clean away dirt and impurities without drying out my skin. I've tried many different brands from both ends of the cost spectrum, but I've never seen one like this. The thick gel stays wherever you put it until you start massaging it into the skin; then the warmth and friction make it melt into an oil. Once you've massaged it all over your face you add a little bit of warm water and massage again, which emulsifies the oil into a white, foam-free lather that rinses away clean with just water. No oily residue is left behind at all, just clean, baby-soft skin. Younger people or those with oily skin may feel the need to follow with a very gently foaming cleanser if their skin feels greasy after, but I don't think its necessary at all. This is my favorite new way to remove makeup at night in one step (although I don't use it for eye makeup removal, but only because I've always just used baby oil and a cotton ball and nothing works better. Nothing).  This is definitely worth a shot if you're curious about oil cleansing, or if you've tried it but hate how messy it can be because its impossible to control the oil running down your face and through your fingers. This gel isn't going anywhere until you want it to.  Two very enthusiastic thumbs up! I destroyed my skin after using facial Nair hair remover and I had to search for alcohol-free face products because my usual cleanser, toner, and lotion burned so bad. Even my Neutrogena oil face wash hurt a little. This Elf cleanser didn't sting at all. My face felt really good after using it. This product does leave a little dewiness on skin after washing. I found if I wash twice, the second time lathering up with warm water so it turns white, it tended to rinse off better. I actually like how this feels after I rinse off; I could skip moisturizer and be fine. It feels really good on my skin now that the air is drier and cooler outside for fall and it hasn't clogged my pores at all so far.This product doesn't lather, it has a very different feel from other cleansers I've tried (almost like vaseline), but it works pretty well with my soft fuzzy makeup remover mitts. It does a pretty good job removing eye makeup, probably because it's a teensy bit greasy.If you have oily skin, or you want to use this in summertime, this probably isn't the right product, unless you want to use this as a makeup remover before washing again with a regular cleanser. If you have sensitive or dry skin, this will work very well for you. This was exactly what I was looking for! It is an interesting, smooth texture when you first apply, not exactly like Vaseline as some other reviews have suggested. It did a great job of taking off my makeup (full disclosure: I used a separate eye makeup remover) and left my face soft as a baby's bottom. The price cannot be beat and the brand is committed to being cruelty free. I will update once I have used it for some time but unless it causes me to breakout, I will be a loyal customer. I love this as a morning cleanse. It does good with removing makeup too, but I have to use more and I'd rather just go in with my Purity cleanser. I'm in love with Elfs packaging, very sleek. I love how gentle this is, it doesn't strip the skin & feels amazing going on. It doesn't irritate my face or break me out (I'm oily combo BTW). If I could change anything about it- It'd be to double the size. It goes pretty fast. great stuff Great product. Cleans very nice and I'd buy it again."
B00VG1GFRY," Love it because it makes me feel clean and good. Product recomended by curology derm. When I ran pit of the small pump bottle I knew I needed the large one. Excellent transaction My son has eczema on his hands and this is the only soap we can use for him I use this as a hand wash and I ordered this because I had great results with other products from this brand. I have exzema on my hands from overwashing my hands, my hands are super dry and cracked. I feel since I've started using this my hands have improved a lot. I still have to remember to use hand lotion many times throughout the day, but my dry skin has gotten a lot better. I will reorder when I run low. I have been on a quest for YEARS to find a cleanser that actually cleaned my face without breaking me out. I found this cleanser after I broke out using Neutrogena's oil free cleanser.  I compared the ingredient list for this cleanser on COSDNA, a site that lists ingredients and rates them on a scale of 1-5 for their likeliness to cause irritation and acne.  It had no ingredients that caused acne or irritation. I tried it and found that it works well at cleaning my face AND doesn't cause breakouts. Now everyone in my family uses it to wash their face. This refill bottle saves us money. Good value for a quality product, especially if you're a regular user. I bought this for a camper last year who lost hers. She was thrilled to have it and it was only worth the money for me to get the biggest size. I love this cleanser so much. I use it on my face day and night & sometimes on my body too. It has no nasty fragrance. I can't stand those scented cleansers that leave a nasty fragrance behind on my face. It also lathers well...just a tiny amount will lather a bunch effortlessly. It feels light on the skin and rinses away clean. This cleanser also does not dry out my skin. I follow up with spf in the morning, and at night I have been following up with my tretinoin cream. My skin is doing awesome. Thank you to this company for one of the best cleansers I've ever used. :) And it's affordable too! My son has some sort of allergy, seems to be a chemical but unsure of which one, he needs another round of testing. This soap works great, won't irritate skin, leaves skin soft. Just soooo expensive. If not so expensive I'd buy it for the whole family, but for now just getting it for my son who must have gentle soap. Great line of products, just wish I could find a better price. Gotta give it 5 stars though, as I tried some other soaps for sensitive skin that were awful. At least this is of high quality. THE only facial cleanser I've used for the last 3 years. Works wonders. Not too harsh, not oily, perfect consistency for cleansing. Recently, I've been using it for the rest of my body as a body wash as well! For the price, the results can't be beat. Lasts a really really long time, too! I seem to be allergic to e-v-e-r-t-h-i-n-g. This is the only soap I enjoy using for my hands and sometimes face (although it can be drying to my face so I try to stick with the gentle free & clear bars there). This smells like absolutely nothing and leaves no weird residue or strange ""fragrance free"" odor. It's just simple soap. Yes, it's expensive, and yes, I feel like I sometimes use more of it to wash my hands and face than I would use of other cleansers because it feels like it takes more to get really foamy. But the cost is worth it because this is the only thing I can use with any real happiness or success. Bought a small one to test it out and it worked well so I got this one to refill the small bottle.This stuff cleans my skin well without irritating it. I also love that it's low pHed (tested it myself and got a result that's between 5.0 and 5.5) so it isn't messing with my skin's moisture barrier and causing body acne which I would occasionally get. The bottle is huge so I expect it to last at least until June. I use a funnel to refill small dispensers around the house. Free & Clear products are essential for folks with eczema or sensitive skin. Not only are the products free of fragrances, they are also free of chemicals used to mask odors. The soap smells like ... water. No odor.  Cleans hands without  the chemicals that irritate allergies. We rely on their products. Purchased this shower gel after developing an all over body rash during my 2nd trimester of pregnancy. It was reccommended by my dermatologist. Product received was as described on label and worked just fine for my needs at that time. Have since recommended the product to family and friends with sensitive skin issues since it is difficult to find a shower gel that has no fragrance and/or other chemicals that can irritate sensitive skin. Price was also reasonable and I liked the fact that it came in a large size so I could refill the dispensers I currently have at home in both shower and sink. I have many allergies, unfortunately - and can no longer use anything with fragrance - and a few other ingredients.  I am so happy to find a really nice, effective liquid cleanser that does not irritate my sensitive skin.  Free & Clear Liquid Cleanser has no odd odor (like some ""fragrance free"" products), it lathers really nicely and it keeps me clean.  I highly recommend it. This soap is gentle for the two eczema-prone members of my family. I'm chemically sensitive and I appreciate the minimal formula without added colors or scents.I prefer buying a large refill size and saving plastic bottles.I wish I could buy this locally and that the price per ounce of refills was less than that of new pump dispensers, but neither seems possible. Too bad for the environment! I purchased Free & Clear Liquid Cleanser in a pump dispenser a few months ago, based on a recommendation from my dermatologist.  I have been satisfied with the cleanser and feel like it rinses cleanly.  I can't say it has eliminated my itching, but at least it doesn't add to it.  I was running out of the 8 oz pump, so I was going to purchase another when I found the 32 oz size.  Three times the price for four times the amount in.  It arrived quickly.  It was wrapped in plastic, had a large piece of tape holding the cap on, and then one of those foil/plastic seals under the cap.  there was no way it was going to leak! The seal was a bit challenging to remove since there weren't any tabs to grab hold of it.  I finally used a pair of scissors.  One word of caution.  Don't refill your pump bottle to the top.  I hadn't intended to, but suddenly, there it was.  I poured some back in the big bottle, but it still wasn't enough because when the pump was replaced, cleanser spilled out over the top onto the sides.  It's a pretty slimy mess to clean off the bottle.  I will be much more careful with future refills.  I don't want the amount I saved by buying the bigger bottle to go down the drain! Got this as a gift for someone - she really likes it for all the reasons that you hate the other stuff. Not smelly, greasy, doesn't dry your skin, etc. Just cleans. Really pleased with this no odor soap. I've been using this soap exclusively for about 8 or 9 years.  I bought it when I was going through a serious bout with cystic acne and started using Retin-A.  It is a lifesaver.  It is gentle on the skin, but it cleans it well.I strongly recommend this soap for people with acne problems; it may seem too mild, but it is exactly what irritated skin needs.I purchased this bottle four months ago and use it to refill the 8oz container.  I still have quite a bit left, and I use it twice a day.  This is a much better value than the 8oz pump bottle, which I used to go through in about a month. My girlfriends hands break out because of perfumes found in most soaps. This does not cause her any issues at all. We love this and will continue to buy it. This is a great cleanser!  I purchased the 32 oz so I could use a ""pump"" and keep it in my shower.  I keep a small bottle, that I can refill, at my sink for use before bed.  It was recommended by my dermatologist due to a possible allergy to an ingredient that I'm coming in contact with.  After figuring out the allergy I went back to my other cleanser and realized I didn't like it as well.  I like this so much that I am re-ordering more.  I follow with the Vani Cream moisturizer and my skin looks better than it ever has! This cleanser works well and does not leave a disagreeable fragrance or residue. A little goes a long way since it is fairly concentrated. I also use it for a hand soap. Good for hand soap,cleans well! This is the perfect hand soap for anyone with sensitive skin like me. I have Atopic Dermatitis (eczema) so my skin is ultra sensitive to all kinds of things they put in skincare. I keep a small bottle of this with me everywhere I go so I can always wash my hands. I also keep it at my kitchen and bathroom sinks. Not everyone can use scented hand soap so this is safe for all. Only soap my husband can use with his skin issues.  It does not exacerbate his eczema and actually helps it!  Excellent product! This product is a must for me, as I developed hand eczema during pregnancy.  And living in the dry desert weather of Phoenix doesn't help skin issues.  This soap is next to all of our faucets, and our entire family uses it. I'm allergic to fragrances, and many other herbs and chemicals. this shampoo I can use with no problems at all, even when it gets in my eyes! A must for those of us that cannot use conventional hand soaps. Pricey, though. Very good soap, strong yet gentle. This is a fantastic face wash!  I have really sensitive acne prone skin and this does not make me break out at all. It lathers up nicely.  I don't take off my makeup before washing my face I just  lather, rinse and repeat and my skin comes out nice and clean. I've had an unexplained rash for months, and I switched from a natural product at Whole Foods to this.  The rash is less severe & less itchy, and we're still trying to figure out the cause of my skin problems. My dermatologist recommended this product and I admit I was skeptical. Not anymore! My skin doesn't itch and the scaly patch on my hand has gone away.  I even tried using the unscented castille soaps and they didn't work nearly as well for my skin.  This soap lathers well and doesn't cause my skin any issues. Love it! Ever since I learned I was allergic to what seems like everything, I was recommended to use this as a face wash/hand soap. It's GREAT! Foams very easily without completely drying out the skin. Takes all my makeup off with one wash and is still gentle enough to use on a day to day basis with my face. Works without issue for my baby who has skin sensitivity issues with soaps and detergents.  Unfortunately doesn't have a nice smell - smells like nothing and that's why it is branded as free and clear. Been purchasing this brand for over a year to use on my daughter that has occasional eczema problems.  It lathers well and has absolutely no fragrance to it.  Sometimes I've noticed a non-fragrance item does still have some smell to it but this one doesn't.  It's a great value as well. Size of this bottle is perfect for refilling the smaller pump  size of the same brand. Same quality item. The BEST for sensitive skin. I get stress hives and I am hypersensitive to fragrances and chemicals on my skin. This stuff has been a God-send! I use it for my face and body. I also use it for my toddler. LOVE this product! This is about the only liquid soap I can tolerate due to fragrance allergies. The large size is more cost-effective than the small bottles. I have been using this product for about 7 years at the recommendation of a dermatologist.  It's the only facial soap I can use on my very sensitive skin and I use it as a shampoo as well.  I'm also sensitive to fragrances so this product being fragrance free is also a plus.  The 32 oz refill is a good value. This cleanser was recommended by my son's dermatologist for his severe eczema. Previously we had purchased refills at a dermatology website, but it is no longer carrying this brand. I was hesitant to order this product from Amazon, as sometimes Amazon's prices are higher than out in the real world. This product was the same price as what we were originally paying and with free shipping from Amazon, we saved money! This cleanser is perfect for anyone's skin, but especially those with sensitive skin like my poor little guy. It has no dyes, perfumes, etc. Highly recommend this product! I love the Free & Clear product and use it for face and body daily.  It cleans well but never leaves my skin feeling dry.  I try to be economical so I was pleased to find it in this large size.  I keep a smaller container in the shower and refill as needed.  Never hurts to save a few pennies. Life altering (for the better) change from the major brands, especially antibacterial soaps. Recommended by the dermatologist as a way to treat/prevent eczema. The whole family uses it now. Wish it were not so expensive. This is the better deal if you already have a dispensing unit (i.e. the shampoo bottle). Go for this as it is cheaper than buying a smaller one that has the little plunger. Super gentle cleanser for people with allergies!  I react to most anything with lanolin or penthenol in it-which is most skin and hair products these days, so I'm so happy to have this cleanser.  I use it twice a day without drying my skin. love this - I keep it in my soap dispenser since I cannot find unscented soap in stores,  also comes in 8oz with a pump, but I have one of the soap dispensers you put your hand under and soap comes outworks great My wife ordered this product after receiving a sample from the dermatologist. This works great on my daughters sensitive skin. Got rid of a skin rash we couldn't pin point what it was. It worked great. This cleanser works great. I have some facial skin problems and it doesn't irritate at all.  Recommended by my dermatologist and me. THIS HAS HELPED FAMILY MEMBER WITH EZCEMA AMD  ITCHY RAW SKIN . IT IS VERY HARD TO DEAL WITH THAT  MOST OF THE TIME ALOE VERA GEL AND OLIVE OIL ARE THE BEST  HELP FOR IT BUT U HAVE TO KEEP CHANGING SO WE TRIED THIS ALONG WITH THE VANICREAM SOAP  AND HE REALLY IS HELPED BY IT ,HOPE IT LASTS FOR HIM Great product. Fast delivery. I used this product when visiting my oldest daughter as that is all she uses! my skin immediately calmed down. I have been using it ever since. I do not have allergies like she does but my skin sure is clearer than it ever has been.. I highly recdommend this product to anyone who wants a product that cleans your skin without any chemicals or smells!!!! It's the only skin cleanser I trust on my face and I have tried them all from low end to high end department store brands. I do not want any harsh chemicals that I can't pronounce going on to my sensitive skin. Free & Clear hands done knocks it out of the park for my acne prone skin. Go ahead and get the small pump dispenser and the large refill because you will not regret switching away from the junk at your local pharmacy or grocery store. After several years, still the one that doesn't make me itch! Great find. I also like their shampoo and conditioner, as well as the related product, vanicream soap. The soap is perfect.  Gentle enough not to irritate my skin, yet good enough to thoroughly wash my face!  I have been using it for years and swear by it.  I also use their face lotion which is perfect for night-time use! Excellent product. No odor. Very good for people with allergies. I love this body wash! My dermatologist recommended this brand to me due to my very sensitive skin and it's great. The only thing is that is has a little bit of an odd smell but that's proof that it is fragrance free and the smell doesn't stick with you at all. Overall though, it is very good at making you feel clean without drying out your skin. We love this product and use it as a face wash. Cleans skin without any harsh chemicals or irritants. I got this originally for my husband when he got a big tattoo on his back so he could keep it clean without irritating it. I continue to buy it however, because I've been using it as well. I have very sensitive skin and a lot of soaps make me break out, sometimes badly. Love this stuff. After reading the 10,000th article on how all the fragrences and other chemicals are not very good for us, I figured I'd get this soap for my toddlers.  The soap works just fine - the only problem is that its expensive.  Too bad Amazon is the only place I can find something like this. This cleanser is a life saver.  I am not allergic to it!  I use it in the shower and for hand washing.  It is not drying.  I also use the lotion, sun block, and shampoo.  A big thanks to my allergist for telling me about it. I use Free & Clear at the recommendation of my dermatologist. My skin is sensitive and extremely dry so I am sold on using products with no harsh chemicals. It's a great cleanser for hands, face and even in the shower. These large refill bottles are an  economical way to refill the small pump bottles. I ordered this soap for use with my contact lenses because I could not find Ivory liquid soap. This is more expensive but it is very gentle and fragrance free. I use it to wash my hands before handling my contact lenses and it has never caused any irritation. Recommend by my physician due to skin allergies. Works well m, my skin is clear. I work in SPED and the children have allergies to almost everything. This great. LOVE this cleanser, gentle, fragrance free and non-drying. Perfect for sensitive skin. I need a fragrance free, quality soap! This is just what the doctor ordered! Good for allergies.I have dry dry dry skin.  It doesn't help the dryness, but I hope over time they won't get worse. My dermatologist recommended this brand to me and it has never failed me!  Great product!! Upon our allergist's recommendation, we have been using this product for years for facial & hand washing & bathing. It has reduced our allergy symptoms greatly.This was the best price that we have ever paid. I have sensitive skin, only cleanser I can use without irritation!Wrote first review months ago!Still using it no irritation!! I highly recommend it to anyone who has sensitive skin! Great product Love this for a hand cleanser! It is great for people who suffer from eczema. I've had a significant reduction in my hand dryness and eczema since I've purchased. This is my second bottle- my first was the smaller pump, now I am onto the larger, more economical refill. Best hand soap for people with skin allergies/sensitivities.  Our ""go to"" hand soap. Love this stuff. I am so sensitive to soaps its the only one I can use with no ill effects. I have used many different kinds of soaps over the years.  I have combination shin which brakes out easily.  A friend recommended Vanicream which I have been using for years, I really love it.  So I gave this soap a chance.  My skin feels wonderful after and my brakes outs are few and far between.  Highly recommend this soap. This is the only face cleanser that I use. I tend to have very very sensitive skin, anything can make my face break out. I went through so many different kinds of cleanser, I cant even begin. Eventually my dermatologist recommended this product and I couldn't be happier with it. I have no breakouts from this product, even after using it for about 4 years. The only small concern I have is if you dont apply moisturizer after using it, it tends to make your skin a little dry. I bought this at the recommendation of my dermatologist.  It does a great job cleaning my face without any side effects of itching or swelling.  Very pleased with purchase. As described I love this product! I can’t find it anywhere but online. I wish I could find it in stores but I never have such luck! I am very happy with this cleanser. I have oily skin and have acne problems from time to time however this cleanser really helped clear my skin. I would highly recommend this product. Refill for our smaller bottles.  Love this F&C product!  It suds up nicely and doesn't make my skin itch. This was a reorder of a product we have used for some time. We are very satisfied with the liquid soap. Nice product Let me start off saying that I detest any cleanser with fragrance or colorant, those two thing don't clean anything.  I ordered this product on a whim and am so glad I did!!  My family uses it primarily as a hand soap, but it works beautifully as a facial and body cleanser.  It has a gel type of consistency and rinses clean without leaving your skin feeling stripped.  I believe this would work for people of all ages, including those with sensitive skin.  I absolutely cannot recommend this product enough!! My skin is very sensitive and dry, and this soap is the best thing I have found for it. I just wish it was locally available so I didn't have to get it shipped to me every few months. That really adds up over time for a daily product. Love that I can get this in a nice refill size.  Was packaged well, sealed top and the whole bottle in plastic. My dermatologist recommends this brand for my sensitive skin and it works well. I developed skin sensitivities a few years ago. This line was recommended by my dermatologist. I have used it ever since and not had any reaction to it. It works like every other liquid soap but without all of the irritants common in the others. Great stuff'! Use it as a shave cream too! Great for my sensitive skin. Thoroughly and gently removes my makeup. I use this cleanser on my face primarily.  You only need an amount the size of a pearl to clean your entire face.  I use it with my Clarisonic and also just on a little round face srubber pad.  It foams but not too much and rinses clean, clean, clean!!  Absolutely no stinging, no burning, no smell, nothing.  I have very oily, maturing, and acne prone skin and this cleans all the dirt, oil, and makeup off my skin without stripping it dry or adding too much moisture that I don't really need.  I use my Proactiv cleanser at night after I use this and then use glycolic acid toner and this cleanser does not interfere with either.  I take this on vacation with me to use all over my body because those hotel soaps are drying and scented and make me itchy.  I can also use this as a shampoo so it's really a do it all product and very convienent and a great price for all that it does for my skin!  I also really like the Vanicream bar soap as an FYI. This seems just  like other liquid hand soaps but without fragrance.  I haven't used this as a bath product yet due to liking the fragrance free soap bar that I already use. Cleans well, very mild. Packaged properly, arrived quickly and without damage or spillage. Good job all around. Love it. It's wonderful  for people with sensitive skin. I'm prone to contact dermatitis so a mild product that actually cleans is great. Super clean feeling after using. No adverse side affects or break outs. Very good product. We use this for eczema and it doesn't irritate the skin like regular soaps do. Free & Clear is the only liquid Cleanser soap that my daughter can use.  She has problems with her skin breaking out if she uses other soaps.  We are happy this was recommended by her doctor. I use this sooooo much and I just love the job it does. I wish I knew about it years ago, but its not too late. My dermatologist sells it for more so I love to refill it from the Amazon site. I arrived on time as usual and I always recommend Amazon. Very light and easy on my sensitive skin Best products for all my allergies. I used it to refill 2 other Free & Clear Liquid Cleanser pumps - one for the shower and one for the sink to wash off my makeup. I use it at least once a day. Highly recommend. It's nice to be able to buy this refill bottle. It came on time and as usual does a great job. My husband likes this to wash his hands Dermatologist recommended product line.

Not one of the Free and Clear products has given me a problem, including hair products!

My husband also uses the product to carefully wash his eyelids and lashes to prevent ocular rosacea. Great for kids with sensitive skin. Love it..

I use it to refill my Free & Clear facial cleanser and it lasts and lasts. It's less expensive than the 8oz with a pump. I suggest just buying a reusable bottle with a pump from the dollar store to use with this refill cleanser. Recommended by my Allergist and excellent for individuals with sensitive skin. Love this soap...it's the only soap that doesnt irrate or break me out! I am glad I have something that works well with my skin.  This product arrived right on time before I ran out.Thanks! I have incredibly sensitive skin and this product keeps my skin fresh and irritant free. I recommend it to everyone and have been using it for years now. I have used this product for years, gentle cleanser. The only liquid cleanser that's sure to not irritate my skin.  Even better than the bar cleanser.  Refill size is most economical way to buy. Exactly as advertised.  Very happy with purchase.  Excellent packaging This product works well with my allergies. I recommend it. I have been using this product for quite awhile now.  It is very helpful for me since I have sensitive skin, especially the skin on my hands.  Other cleansers will cause my hands to get extremely dry and scaly, and then the skin splits and bleeds. This condition is very painful.  My hands tolerate this cleanser very well.  I even keep some at work.  Excellent product. Works fine This has proven to be fragrance free and cleans great.  I recommend to all who have fragrance allergies and need allergy relief. I love this product! I use it twice daily on my face and neck!  Never leaves my skin feeling tight and dry but always smooth and soft! Perfect for sensitive skin. I have used it for many years. Quick delivery, great product? This cleanser is perfect,it is smooth and not too stimulative to my sensitive skin.I love this product! Will recommend to my friend. Great Product Will buy again Great Product and this is a convenient size to refill smaller 8 ounce containers.  Great price too!  thanks so much It works for me since I am alergic to what is not in the cleanser and it still suds, thanks Being in the medical field I have had plenty of horrible times with my hands. I went to a dermatologist who has the same dry, cracky hands that I have. My hands get so bad at times that they crack and bleed. My  Dr recommended this cleanser and within a couple of days I seen and felt a difference. She also prescribed a cream and it's helping also. My better half now says he don't mind holding my hand instead of holding a pot scratcher. i use it on my face, something i cant do with other products.  it's great for people with skin allergies This line is the ONLY stuff we can use in our house due to severe eczema and allergies. My daughter's skin has SIGNIFICANTLY improved and stayed that way since we started using all Vanicream products (shampoo, conditioner, body wash and moisturizer) about year ago. My wife wouldn't use anything else.  Allergy free very good I have been using free and clear products for years but this one is the one I continuously purchase. I use it to wash my hands and face. I found out awhile ago that I am allergic to many fragrances so this product is great for me. I didn't know I was allergic but kept breaking out in acne and rosacea type bumps on my face. I realized I sleep with my hands under my face and so the residue from soaps were in contact with my skin all night. This product greatly reduced the breakouts. My dermatologist recommended this face wash for my sensitive skin.  Very infrequently I will get a blemish on my face, but when I use Free & Clear, I do not.  I use it once in the evening only, since my face has become dry when using it twice.  Great product that I will continue to use.  It is way cheaper to buy this refill for the pump container that holds 8 fl. oz. Our dermatologist had this brand on a list of recommendations that he provided to us when we took our child in due to rashes and slight eczema.  I have been using this for several weeks now and so far we love it.  My baby (now 14 months old) would get occasionally itchy skin.  I love that this product is free of a lot of chemicals that the other companies we've tried have in them.  There is not much of a scent to it but that's fine with me because those can be irritants.  Also, it doesn't sud up a whole lot.  You'd have to use a lot for that to happen but that is also okay.  The main reason I like the product is that my daughter has not been itching or had any flare ups.  I will likely purchase this again!  Also, the large bottle is such a value over buying the smaller bottle that comes with the pump.  You can buy a small bottle with pumper for a dollar and just dispense this into that container. Wonderful product !!! I am using it due to dry skin from chemo and it doesn't have foreign ,artificial ad unnecessary additives and it's gentle on the skin. Just what it says Free and Clear. I will use it because it's gentle ,when I start radiation. I am also using Free and Clear lite lotion/Vanicue. Thank you for a great product. This brand of skin care products, Pharmaceutical Specialities, Inc., has saved my hyper-sensitive, intolerant skin.  The Free & Clear Liquid Cleanser serves as my makeup remover and face cleanser, in one easy step.  I use it twice a day.  My face feels cleansed, soft, and comfortable.  No tightness.  No dryness.  No irritation.  No residue left behind.  No stripped feeling.  I purchase the 32 oz. refill bottles from this seller, and fill the 8 oz. pump bottles I have next to every sink in my home.  I also use this product as my household hand cleanser.  I always purchase from this seller.  Without exception, my bottles arrive promptly and very well packaged.  I love that every bottle comes individually shrink wrapped in plastic.  This assures me the freshness and integrity of the product has been maintained during shipping.  I highly recommend purchasing from this seller. I love this brand! I used to have rashes, acne, itchy and irritated skin, and psoriasis, but ever since I started using this product, as well as their shampoo, conditioner, and bar soap, all my skin problems have gone away. It's a bit expensive, but you only need a little bit per use. My husband loves these products too and since there is no fragrance, we smell like how we are supposed to smell...natural! We love that we can enjoy each other's aroma without masking the nature of who we are! Recommended by my dermatologist.  Excellent cleansing properties without the drying effects of soap.Five stars. Doctor recommended, free and clear no perfumes, or anything that you could be allergic to.  Only product I've found that doesn't contain alcohol or lanolin Both of my boys have sensitive skin. Our water is not that great either. The youngest has too many allergies, and his allergy specialists recommended this. His skin is now always so soft and clean, which wasn't always the case with the little guy. When I use other baby stuff, such as California Baby Sensitive (which I do love also) he will start getting bumps, rashes or rough skin on his legs and elbows. The tub of lotion is by Free & Clear is also amazing, I use for myself also. I recommend it for anyone with skin issues. Love that I can get a refill for this. I have bought the smaller dispenser ones and kept them so now I have in 2 bathrooms.  Love it My daughter has eczema that we recently discovered is due to allergies to several things. Her Allergist highly recommended this product. It seems to help. Since she has started using it, her eczema has calmed down and is better than it has been in years! Great size and price for the cleanser! Works great for sensitive skin and helps keep from having outbreaks of eczema. We will continue to use this product!"
B01LXQW57G," Ok, Ok, I'm a guy and I shouldn't be using this stuff, right? But I have and I do and I will continue to do so for as long as I feel like it. I have some dry patches on my face and I used this along with the Tiger Lily Hyaluronic Acid Serum in the evenings and it has cleared my dry patches up completely. I went away for a long weekend and forgot to bring it with me and paid the price, but a couple days after getting back I was all good again. I highly recommend this family of products. I have drier skin, and have started using this moisturizer several nights per week before bed.  It actually helps give me a very gentle peel with no redness or irritation (and no rx) - a gentle exfoliating cleanse in the morning, followed by the Hyaluronic Acid Serum (same company), sunscreen and I'm good to go! I've been using this retinol moisturizer for about a month and my skin has definitely improved!  It feels clearer, more even, and even some of my fine lines have disappeared.  It is like a little renewal every night.  Combine with a good exfoliant for extra benefit! This is a MUST! I positively love it! I bought all 3 of the Tiger Lily products. All are great, but this Retinol Moisturizer is amazing. I spend a lot of time in the pool and outside and this is the most softening product I have ever used on my face. I can't believe how my skin feels years younger when I put this on at night. This is a wonderful moisturizer!  I noticed a difference in my skin's texture the very first week ...it's soft and moisturized, but not one bit shiny or greasy. Super happy with this product.  (And the bottle and box are especially pretty too.) I've been using this product for about a week along with the Tiger Lily brand vitamin c serum and hyalutonic acid and have seen a noticeable transformation in my complexion. My pores have diminished and my skin feels firmer. Will definitely purchase again! I have been using all 3 of the Tiger Lily products for about 3 months now and I'm really noticing a difference.  My ""older"" skin is smoother and the tone has improved quite a bit.  I'll keep using and will reorder as needed.  Great products! This product is so light and I am starting to see improvement in the texture of my skin. This retinol feels light and smells nice! It's also a really good size tube compared to all other retinol creams I've purchased. I used it at night and woke up the next more with very smooth skin. My friend recommended this moisturizer and I just had to try.  The product is awesome and my skin feels great.  I will have to try other products from Tiger Lily... This is my new fave! Love how it feels putting it on and after a week, my skin feels ridiculously amazing. Great price, too. I've tried a bunch of these and so far, I'm loving this one. product is great- nice packaging too! I ordered all three Tiger Lily face products to try something new. First off, the packaging is really pretty! But besides that it feels great on my skin. I have pretty oily skin and noticed on day one that after I got off of work my skin wasn't quite so oily as it has been in the past. I then tried the retinol moisturizer last night and I LOVE it! It's definitely my favorite of the three.I also found out that part of the proceeds of this company go towards a charity that supports an  auto immune disease, so that's pretty fantastic as well.Lastly, these products are all natural made from organic products so that sealed the deal for me! Seriously, get you some of this stuff, it's awesome!! I stumbled across this when looking for a new natural face product and I just loved the label, but it's actually a really great retinol serum, it's light and feel super smooth and I already feel my skin has evened out just after 2 weeks of use. I am looking forward to what this brand will come out with next! I love using my new rentiol cream so much that I had to buy the Vitamin C serum and the haudralyic acid serum. I have only been using the product for a short amount of time and I am already feeling my skin change and become more soft to the touch. I'm also newly receiving conpletements on my completion which really says something! Love! I'm a skincare junky and retinol is a must. This particular product has a high percentage of retinol so a little goes a long way. Highly recommend!"
B000GW4B2K," My wife love the creams. This is my favorite cleanser! Leaves my skin clear by hydrated. Great for my acne prone and sensitive skin I usually use the Normal/dry skin face wash but this summer my skin has been so oily! I started using the combination face wash for about a week now and I already notice a huge difference! My skin isn't oily anymore, my pores are shrinking and my face has clear skin!  In the winter I'll probably go back to the normal/dry and stick to this one in the summer! Happy I tried this product. Amazing I love this stuff!!

Mary Kay is all I use on my skin. Flawless and it shows. I received it in its original box. My face is very oily, never dry, and Mary Kay suds up just right.

If you have sensitive skin like me ...this is AWESOME This actually does remove wrinkles! I'm in my early 50s and in about two months I noticed my wrinkles were noticeably smaller. I've used this for years and recommend it! Great cleanser! My favorite MK cleanser to date and I have used MK for 25 years. Cleans well with no drying for normal/oily skin. Also comes in dry skin formula. Just use a tiny bit and it goes a long way. Just what I needed! Thank you! Very pleased with purchase.

I have sensitive skin and have been prone to adult acne, but have noticed fewer flare-ups.  A little goes a long way, especially if you use a facial sponge. Delivered so fast. I have no complaints. Wish I could order all my MaryKay from them Great for any skin type but especially SENSITIVE SKIN. I preferred the previous formula but this one's good too. I've been using Mary Kay for more than 15 years and won't use anything else! I have used Mary Kay products for over 25 years and I like how they protect my skin. Time Wise Cleanser gently cleans away the dirt and leaves my skin soft. Adding the Mary Kay Moisturizer feels silky plus I don't feel the ""after the washing"" tightness.

I have used this product for years and have always been pleased with it. My skin is oily in spots and dry in others, and this cleanser works well - I did have an acne problem before I started this product, and I haven't been bothered with breakouts in years. Excellent product! I've been using for years and love it! I love this cleanser it makes your skin feel clean but not stripped. I have been using this cleanser for years. Love it! It works great. You need to use for a few weeks before you can see and feel the difference. Love this product orde it over and over again. I think this cleanser is the best among mary kay stuff.

The best 👏🏼 Works just like if I bought it from a Mary Kay salesperson. Now I can skip meeting with someone and just have it delivered to my door. Not a bad price either. I have oily/acne skin as an adult. I have tried other numerous cleansers of all different brands, and I have found Marykay products work best for my skin. This really removes my makeup, is non-drying, and my skin feels refreshed. Great product. Thanks. Good cleansing product I use it every night. Leaves my skin clean and clear, no dryness My favorite face wash. Just what i wanted Good I've been using this face wash for years. I love it. I have dandruff on my forehead and my face gets pretty greasy. This face wash, as well as the moisturizer I also use, keep my face looking clean and the dandruff at bay. Use it on a regular, daily basis for the best results though. If I skip a day or two then my problems come back. Mary Kay products don't irratate my skin and leaves it fresh and soft. I have super sensitive skin so I have to be extra careful about which products to use, even ""sensitive skin"" products leaves my skin feeling terrible. Great stuff A great product by Mary Kay! Been using it for years. This is a great product. Love it! Great product, good price(yes it less on Amazon) and yes it is the same product. I have purchased  it through  the  Company so I can say it's the same product. It works so well leaving my face feeling clean and not oily. Great facial wash - I don't buy anything else to clean my face It is hard to find a face wash without salicylic acid in it. I have been using this face wash for several years and it removes make up very well without leaving my skin feeling dry. My usual mary kay contact stopped selling and I was delighted to find that I could purchase it with amazon prime!

Great products. Great over all product Mary Kay skin care is a high quality, high performance product.  It does a great job cleaning and refreshing the skin all the while helping make the skin more youthful.  I have tried other products but always come back to Mary Kay. I (better yet my skin)I really like this product.. My normally oily skin seems to me better controlled. I sometimes get  small dry spots at the corners of my mouth/ cheeks during colder months so I'll back off using a little. overall I'm very pleased with the product Favorite facial cleanser! fine I love Mary Kay's 3-in-1 cleanser for (comb/oily skin).  It doesn't dry your face out too much, and helps to gently exfoliate your face.  If you're skin is starting to show signs of fine lines and wrinkles, this is a great product to use. Works very well. everything by mary kay is really good quality and that includes this cleanser light and non abrasive. Outstanding!! The Mary Kay Time Wise 3-in-1 Cleanser is product is very good and I would purchase it again!  Mary Kay transitioned to a newer version of this product, I haven't tried it yet, but I'm hoping that it's as good as this version. This product is great. Yes very satisfy First time using the new cleanser. I like it. I love Mary Kay products, and have been using them for 30 years. love this product Love it I love this stuff. it is so great. Lasts for a long time, so the price is super for how long it lasts. ONLY STUFF MY FRIENDS USE Loved!! Love the product!! Good stuff! Like product got here in timely manner. Great cleanser As a long-time fan of Mary Kay Products since I was in my 20s, the Timewise is wonderful for the aging skin.  I started using Timewise in my early 40s and my skin looks pretty damn good.  I had bad acne as a teenager and have had all sorts of treatments for it.  This is the only  cleanser and moisturizer product line that I know is consistent and doesn't irritate my skin - EVER.  When I change products, I am always disappointed.  Sticking with Mary Kay Love this cleanser leaves face clean and removes all my makeup! Im obsessed! I never breakout. And it makes my skin feel clean and smooth. It is the only product I've used that doesn't over dry your skin yet deep cleans your pores. Love this product it is the only one that works, I have tried dozens and have still had blemish problems.. This product is the only one that works and keeps my skin clear.. The cleanser was exactly what I wanted. This help to get all of my make-up off. I have been using this product for years.  I feel refreshed after using this product. This is the cleanser I used forever!  It works Great:) The best💕 worked well This is a very good quality cleanser it works very well and it leaves your skin veru soft ive been using it for a long time and i love it. AMAZING. use this. youre face will clear up within a week. I love this product Never disappointed with Mary Kay great product Mary Kay's Timewise 3-in-1 Cleasnser is awesome!

You only need a little at a time. Great product,have been using this for a while,goes a long way & does a great job. excelente REALLY LIKE HOWIT FEELS ON THE SKIN DURING THE SCRUB OF MY FACE It feels nice when applying to face, leaving it residual free & feeling soft & clean This product works well to cleanse my skin without leaving it too dry. This face wash is the best. It is usually a splurge considering it is more expensive than my normal drugstore face wash, but it is well worth the price. Several months ago my face started breaking out, even though I was using a facescrub that is frequently advertised on TV to prevent breakouts. I decided to fork out the money for the Mary Kay TimeWise face wash, and the bottle has lasted me 4 months. Only now do I need a replacement. Money is tight right now with a child in daycare, but this is one item that is worth the cost! Especially when it lasts so long! I love it! I LIKE IT It arrived as promised, was new in the package as promised.I have used this product for years and paid more for it. This was great. Quick delivery and great item! Very fast shipping. Love this product! I love the Mary Kay Timewise 3-in-1.  My skin feels clean after using it.  I love the way this product lathers, unlike the normal to dry where you are not sure if your face is clean. Item arrived as described. Very quick transaction. Mary Kay--good product line. Love Mary Kay products! I have been using this line for years and still works the best for my combo skin type.. acne prone. I love MK Timewise products and don't really know what I did before using them. I really don't think there is another product out there that I would use. The best facial cleanser!  Even my husband uses it.  Very gentle, non-abrasive and leaves your skin feeling light without drying it out. This face wash has worked amazingly on my sensitive oil-prone skin. I use it with the moisturizer in the same line and together they work so well! My skin has cleared up immensely. Arrived quickly with no issues.Definitely recommend! I love this product. It helps keep you looking youthful. Highly recommend this very good. As expected Super fast shipping!  Love this product I have been using it for years.  Its the only thing that does not make my face have an allergic reaction Love the feel after cleansing! Great product Great product! I love it! :O) I have used this for years and loooove it! :O) I don;t use any other Mary Kay products so I am an unbiased customer. Everything went smoothly and I got what I paid for. I'm not sure why these reviews have to be so long. My skin is like butter after using this.  I temporarily went back to my Proactiv routine and then to a new face wash by MK that had a toner in it.  Still, this is my fave. I was very happy to see my favorite Mary Kay products offered on Amazon ! This cleanser makes my skin look & feel smooth. Great cleanser. This cleanser does an excellent job with my skin type.  I recommend Mary Kay for everyday use.  Mary Kay has the secret to beautiful skin! As promised! Thank you! I use this cleanser every morning and every night. It's an awesome product that leaves my face feeling so clean and fresh. Same cleanser you can buy from a rep As expected. I have been using this moisturizer for a year, it is by far my favorite one out there.  The whole Mary Kay line works great for me. I really loved this product it leaves my skin feeling soft and looking health. Also the product arrived it great condition and on time. Love this product!  Was happy to find it at a great price!  Mary Kay products are great for your skin! Reel good. I recommend to my friend and family. I am pleased with the resultats because my skin seems really heathy now. Use it all the time...Love it...Using it for 20 years...Love it! Love it Love it Good=Bye Thank you, God Bless Really like this face wash and it, makes my face feel really clean after using it.  Will buy it again. Love it will order again Love Mary Kay Great product For Oily/Combo skin you can't beat the MaryKay Time wise 3-in-1 cleanser.  It gets your skin nice and clean.  LOVE IT! I have always loved Mary Kay products! It helps clear my pores and helps with cleansing more than just your face. Excellent stuff for OILY SKIN good Love it and it came quick Great product been using it for years. very satisfied thank you very much i accidnetally chanced upon Mary Kay products and have been hooked to the brand since 2009. i can't do without this product - always re-order half way through Good product for oily skin. Thx! Good buy i have use mary kay products since 30 years ago. time wise put them better tah ever. thank you very much. Love It! This is a great cleanser.  It removes makeup well even eye makeup.  I don't like to run out of it and try to reorder often.  Mary Kay has been around for decades and in general they make good products.  I am not endorsing MK nor do I sell their products.  I would recommend this cleanser for makeup removal.  I usually follow up with another line of products but I find this works best if you like to take off your makeup or oil and dirt before you use another product. I bought this product as a scary risk. I was nervous about buying 2 mary kay products online so cheap. but I was pleasantly surprised. my products came in one package so shipping was cheaper. and it came with a free mirror! this seller is amazing! I am so impressed and amazed at how quick the service was. I received my products the following week!! I will continue to buy from this seller. I go out of my way to look and see if this particular seller has other products I am interested in so I can buy from a trusted source. good great price! very good I'm not sure what it is about this product, but this is the only product that's been able to smooth out my crazy oily/combination skin and clear up the acne and it's not even an acne product. I'm also not a fan of MK products, but this product works wonders for me. This a great facial cleanser. You don't have to use much, and it makes your face feel really good - not dry at all.  It's great stuff! You can use a pea sized drop and it will be enough to wash your whole face and more.  I love this face wash I like this product because it is a great face cleanser. It is gentle on my face unlike other cleansers. I looove this cleanser, is so gentle but removes most of my makeup that others cleansers didn't.  Fragrance free whis is a plus for me since Im so sensible for scents. A tube lasts for me about 3 months. Love It sooo much!! I have very oily skin and this is the only thing that kept it in place. I recommend this for anyone who has to blot or powder their face about every 2 hours. Supper product Great product, works great on my oil skin Keeps my face clear of breakout! I love Mary Kay! I will buy the whole package from my Mary Kay consultant but of course run out of one product before the others so I bought this so it would last until I need to whole package again!!! Same as the product that was received from Mary Kay!!! And I love the price!!! Best cleanser!! My skin feels soo amazing and is clearing up. I gave Mary Kay Timewise 3-in-1 Cleanser -Combination to Oily Skin a 5 star rating because this product has just enough cleansing power not to strip natural oils. I have always had an oily complexion. Mary Kay has balanced that. I feel cleansed after I use it. Also the lotions for after cleansing are great. I use Mary Kay microderm abrasion wash. That really exfoliates the dead skin. It is almost embarassing to say that I ordered the Mary Kay TimeWise 3-in-1 Cleanser by accident thinking it was the moisturizer. I am glad it was an accident because I've completely forgotten about how this cleanser makes your skin feel! My pores are tighter, skin is smoother, and in essence, I feel as though I've got baby skin again! The feeling right after use is amazing...so clean like it's pulled all of the dirt and oil from my face and softened it at the same time! I love Mary Kay! This product is amazing! Great product..fast delivery! Finally found a product that removes makeup quickly and skin looks clean. All you need is two dime size applications and water and all you can see your makeup wash away! Perfect for the face. Fixed my problem, and sent me something in return and then credited me back for the item that I didn't want. Very happy with my liquid foundation. I made the mistake of switching from this to African Black Soap and suffered horrible breakouts which lead to scarring. :( I've learned my lesson and will stick with Mary Kay. It controls the oil in my skin and the breakouts better than any other cleanser I've used. Definitely worth the price. More than what I ever expected. Has the same affect on men, too. Controls break outs and my skin is soft. Great product. Have used this cleanser for years and find that it goes a long ways and does what Mary Kay claims it will--cleans the face and does a mild exfoliation each time you cleanse. To whom this may concern. I found all my items on there but the cost of Shipping & Handling was horrible..How can one be charged $4.95 each item and on one item I paid as much as if I had bought it from the company. My Bella cologne was horrible.Smell is short term and It seems watered down.SincerelyJoyce Anderson This cleanser is great for sensitive and acne prone skin. Ive used thousands of dollars on other store bought cleansers and nothing can compare to how smooth,  soft and clear my face has become.  I began to notice an difference after a few days. This is great when paired with the combination/oily face Lotion. I LOVE this face wash! I purchased my first tube a few years ago and it lasted forever (over a year). It just takes a tiny little bit to cleanse your face and neck, so it's really a great value, also. I like the way it makes my skin feel and look, and it's gentle enough to use on my eyes to remove makeup. I highly recommend. Leaving review for my wife, as I purchased it for her.  All I know is that she loves the Mary Kay products as a whole, and this is one that is a ""must have"" for her.  I'm not necessarily attributing this all to MK, but my wife has been using MK products for a long time, and she's still very young & healthy looking at 38 years of age.  Not sure what else to say, but she always gets a big smile on her face when a Mary Kay product arrives :-)*I'm leaving similar reviews on all MK products I regularly purchase - as I said, my wife loves MK! This stuff is better than ProActiv! I love this Mary Kay facial wash. I have always had bad acne and my face has always had many dark spots , since using this everyday it has made my face look so much better I don't even feel the need to wear makeup .... :) I can rock the natural look without feeling awkward! What??? You can get your Mary Kay products without having to deal with a sales rep?! My life is complete. I like that I only need to use a little of the 3-in-1 cleanser and it lasts  longer. Even though I did not buy this product on Amazon (bought it from a Mary Kay consultant) I will review it because often I find myself coming on Amazon just to see a products review whether I'm inside the store or elsewhere.So I purchased this product around two months ago. It is absolutely a wonderful product. It leaves my face feeling and looking noticeably better as well as my face has substantially cleared up from breakouts. I also have been using this with the same brand/ moisturizer. I've used this cleanser in combination with the moisturizer and day and night creams for over a year. My skin is combination type and I have been prone to acne since I was a teenager. I decided to start using them a few months before I got married last summer and I was looking for a perfect skin-care regimen. I have never really found products that ""work for me"" before and was feeling a little jealous of my friends who'd seemed to find their perfect products. My Mary Kay consultant found and contacted me through a bridal drawing I had won (how random!) and within a month or so of using these products I was already getting several compliments on my complexion (I still can't believe it, that has never ever happened in my life before!). I use the cleanser on a daily basis and it does not dry my skin out. I control for mild acne (it always happens around that time of the month!) with another product that is not Mary Kay - I have not tried the MK Acne Gel - but my skin really never looked this good in the days before I started using it. I'm sure it would look at its best all the time if I would only remember to use the day and night cream with as much vigilance as I use the cleanser! It's hard to use it consistently when I work graveyard shifts! I am, however, very, very pleased with the Mary Kay products I have tried! I have sensitive skin and am prone to breakouts...somehow, this cleanser works wonders for me. I noticed a change in my skin the first week I started using it--it reduced the amount of pimples on my face significantly. I think this might be due to the fact that it cleans well but leaves some necessary natural oils on your face. I have been using this cleanser religiously for 6 years. I didn't find the Timewise moisterizer helpful...it didn't seem to do anything for my face. I've tried other Mary Kay moisturizers and serums but they either made my face too oily or too dry/scaly so I gave up. Definitely recommend. I use MK timewise cleanser for combination to oily skin in the shower every day. I like the gel type texture with the beads that burst when rubbed onto my face. I also like how my face feels after I rinse it off. Sometimes I apply it to my neck and chest if they are feeling oily. It works wonders! I use it all the time and will continue to purchase this product I took a chance by buying this cleanser through Amazon - when I usually use a Mary Kay rep. Well, that chance paid off. My item arrived in great condition - boxed, wrapped in plastic, and works just as well as it always has. I have used Mary Kay for years, and it has always kept my skin clear and refreshed. Very happy with this purchase! I have combo skin, and this has helped clear up my hormonal and adult acne. A little bit goes a long ways, so a tube will last a good while.  Brought on some redness at first, but my skin has adjusted, and looks very clear now. My pore size has been reduced over the weeks, and I think my overall skin tone has improved. I can go out in public now with a ""naked"" face. I will reorder this product. Price: 5 stars * Fair * Way much cheaper on amazon vs buying on mary kay online no offenseOil control:  4 starstight dry feeling?: NoneBreak outs: NoneI am very pleased with this product since I have very sensitive skin with a bit of oily skin, I finally found product to help my problem. I'm not old enough to use anti-aging products.. I Just use sunblock... i am mk beauty consultant and i love this stuff its amazing I've used this MK product for years and I love it! It's the only face wash that removes my make up without the oily feel afterward. I will never buy anything else! :) Best cleanser for sensitive skin. Even though this cleanser is in the timewise line, I'm 23yrs old and I've been using this cleanser since I was 19 yrs old. This is the only cleanser that have worked for my combo/oily sensitive skin. This cleanser leaves my face clean w/o drying it out and It leaves my face feeling tight (like a  peel which I like). It has no smell and it has these little beads for light exfoliating(not harsh). I have been using this cleanser for 5 yrs now, in between I have used other cleanser because of change of climate, hormones etc, but I have always came back to using this cleanser. Love it! I'm 53 years old and I always get compliments on my skin.  I'm not brand loyal and have used just about every kind of scrub on the market. It's been over a year since I started using the Mary Kay and I love it!  I use it gently around my eye area with my fingers and then I put some on a cotton pad and scrub my face, neck and hairline area with a little more vigor.....both morning and night.  An easy way to see how well this product works is to use it on one arm and another scrub on the other arm for a week or so.  You won't believe the difference in the texture of your skin and on how smoothly your lotions apply.  It's more expensive than other products but lasts twice as long.  Love it! It was very good to my skin. I will keep using it. I had bad ance for about a year and I tried a few things but they never worked! Finally I tried this and I love it! It's also removing my dark spots now, and I only been using it for less than 2 months. I for sure recommend this product. I have used this cleanser for many years and I have to say this is the best by far!  No harsh chemicals, very gentle and just smooth. I look alot younger!!...I have alot of complements on my skin and it evens my tone.  This takes off all make up even stubborn eye makeup.  Highly recommend!! NOTE: Not recommended for the eye area.This cleanser removes heavy makeup and does a great job removing dirt in pores. Perfect for those looking for an all-in-one cleanser.It is creamy with small pink beads in it. You rub it on face and wipe it off with a warm cloth. That is it! Your face is clean! price was awesome delivery was great Great product! Item arrived in 2 days after order"". Been using for a few years now. I love this face cleanser. First, it actually cleans the makeup off! I have super sensitive skin and it does not cause breakout. I use it in combination with the night and day serum moisturizer at night. I'm 19 years old tend to break out once in a while and I've tried neutrogena (not bad), clinique, olay, aveeeno and all kinds of moisturizers honestly this is the best one i've ever used I was septikal about this product because I tought people just wanted to sell sell sell but WOW WAS I WRONG THIS IS THE BEST CLEANSER my face feels happy it cleans but it also leaves my skin velvety, soft like a baby's skin soo smooth!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It might not work for everyone but it did for me! :) THANK YOU MARY KAY! =) Good purchase. Love this product. I use it daily and it keeps my face looking fresh and with a glow. Easy cleansing. Not harsh. This is an excellent facial cleanser.  I have combination skin like most people.  This cleanser is effective but doesn't overly dry out spots. MUST HAVE!!! I have used this product for years and swear by it.  It really helps my face to be moisturized and I have no wrinkles yet."
B0027I4J50," This stuff is the best!  It's kind of expensive, but it really does the job and it doesn't irritate our dog's eyes.  Just squirt a bit on a soft towel and gently rub it into the eye goo, or whatever else is making your dog's face dirty.  It just dissolves the dirt etc. to be wiped away! Love the smell! It doesn't irritate my dog's skin and doesn't smell like someone dumped perfume on my dog. A little goes a long way. Make sure to read the instructions on how to dilute the shampoo. Smells great! I love it and so do my grooming customers. I love this scent, I spray it on my dog when he starts to get a little stinky, but its not time for a bath yet Works best for our Bichons if I put it on when the fur is dry 10 minutes before the full body shampooing. Seems to whiten much more. This will sting the eyes. All in all I do like this product. Works very well around the eye area, it helps clear the stains as well. This smell is amazing!!!! Recommended!! Super easy to use and does a good job both softening up and cleaning the under eye area for my little teddy bear dog. I love the way my dogs smell after their bath. My dogs stay clean with this soap and not oily or greasy. Love this for my two Havanese dogs, great plum fragrance. Can't find in stores anymore for some reason good dog shampoo left bella smelling good.  makes a great lather and the the delivery was fast and service was great will use petedge again Smells so good I LOVE the way this stuff smells! It helps deodorize my dogs and lingers on my Border Collie's fur pretty well. Bit pricey, but worth it when I don't have time to bathe them! I have used this product for several years to shampoo my Westies. No skin issues at all and their coat is very shiny and white. love this brand, smells so good! I am a professional dog groomer and I LOVE the smell of this. My clients really enjoy it as well. Very good product Nice scent The Espree scent renewal plum conditioner has a nice scent. I really like the way it leaves my shnoodles coat looking and feeling. Groomers love this shampoo My dog is very very very white, and needs his face washed after he eatsthis facial cleanser does work. This product is one of my favorites in my groom shop. It smells wonderful, cleans beautifully, and works on every coat type. An employee used it accidentally on a dog with sensitive skin that usually gets a tea tree and aloe shampoo and there was no reaction at all and the owners of the dog requested it the next time because their little Maltese was so white and pretty! It's my basic every day shampoo and I love it! I know Im using good quality and it helps keep customers to not skimp on things like this! Details matter:) wonderful smell and easy to use! I have never found anything that dissolves the stuff under my dogs eyes! This does the trick!!! Would recommend it to anyone!!! Love this!  This is the best face cleaner for dogs I have found!  The scent is wonderful. Would highly recommend. Wonderful shampoo!  Smell is great and leaves coat in nice condition.  My grooming clients always ask what shampoo I use My customers love this scent Great product. Have used several times from local pet shop, but they no longer carry this fragrance. Great Product Quickly shipped our order.  Very pleased with the product. My favorite scent. All my customers love it! My baby puppy smells great with it, I love it. Love it!easy to freshen there faces. Love love love this smel. Only one I can stand to smell and makes my dogs smell like they just had a bath Love this shampoo.  It makes the dogs smell wonderful and the white on my Cavalier King Charles just ""glows"".  It also makes my black Scottie look nice and bright.  Also like the fact that the shampoo is natural and organic. I like this Espree Plum Perfect Facial cleanser much better than the Tropiclean Tear Stain Facial Scrub that I have been using.  I used it on my four little rescue dogs and it loosened the eye gunk very easily while I gave them a bath.  I applied and massaged the light, pleasant scented foam to their dry facial fur and on top of the eye gunk before giving them a bath.  After their shampoo and rinse, I went ahead to rinse and work on their face.  The eye gunk was loose and came off easily so I could finish washing their faces.  3 Yorkies and a Maltese didn't mind this product on their face and I enjoyed this scent a lot more than the Tropiclean's scent.  They do tend to lick any type of cleanser on their face so I wanted a tearless, gentle formula made specifically for the face.  I would definitely purchase this again. Wonderful cleanser. Easily removes crusty eye debris. Foamy, simple to use. Does not hurt dogs' eyes. I have a Shih Tzu who was a rescue and has emotional problems.  He gets hard crusty eye drainage as he ages (9).  He would bite when we tried to scrub the stuff off.  He ended up on cyclosporine for dry eye syndrome, but still has drainage.  I put some of this on a wet washcloth, gently washed his eyes.  I went back expecting to scrub off the debris. The plum perfect facial cleaner had softened the debris that quickly and it rinsed off easily.  I really am thrilled I found this.  Wish there was something this easy for ears also.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND. This smells great on my Westie. I love all the ingredients listed on the bottle and the smell lasts a very long time and I would use it as my laundry detergent ifI could. That's how good it smells. I use this shampoo on a large percent of the dogs I groom at my salon. It is great on white, gray, brown, and tan coats. Smells wonderful and cleans very well. I do not use it on the face because Espree's other products specify when it is safe to use around the eyes and this one does not. I dilute at a 10 to 1 ratio. I've also never had any dogs have a negative reaction to any Espree products! This product actually does what it says and has done wonders with Poppy's tear stains. It took about ten days to really see a difference! Also, No more soap in Poppy's eyes! She's happy and so am I! I work at a doggy daycare and we have several dog baths to give a day. All though I love all Espree shampoos, this one is my favorite. It smells amazing - even after the bath! Doesn't have an overpowering scent either. I have a German Shepherd mix with major oil production. This shampoo gets her squeaky clean and she smells wonderful for the weeks to follow! Luckily, once the sweet scent has faded she remains scentless. That's right, no severe stinky doggy smell.Trust me, this shampoo is amazing. I have it at home as well!The amount needed for a bath largely depends on the breed. My dog is huge and doesn't need very much of it at all! Maybe about the size of a pool ball. I have a Yorkie as well and he only uses about the size of a penny, if that! That said, it will last you FOREVER.Love this stuff! I use this shampoo on my personal dogs as well as at the animal shelter where I volunteer groom. We get a lot of stinky dogs and this cleans well and leaves a nice fresh scent. Doesn't dry the skin even after multiple baths, which is sometimes necessary. Great product. This worked so well! We used it on our Pekingese mix. She had a bunch of thick dried who knows what around her eyes when we picked her up from the humane society and the regular eye wipes didn't do the trick. Once I used this it cleaned her eyes right up! They're free of all the goop and her eyes seem so bright now. Highly recommended. Works awesome and smells even better than the oatmeal version, also made by the Espree folks. Love this product, I have been using it for several years. Love Espree products"
B005LZT9CO," Love this cleanser, thanks for prompt service. Great product. Love what it does for my skin. Perfect for sensitive skin. Exactly what I wanted and works great! I could never find anything that works well for my skin. Anything else causes me to have breakouts or dry skin .This stuff is great. I'm on my 2nd bottle and while it's expensive, I think it's worth it. Love Eminence Skin care products.  My sister-in-law is an esthetician and she uses these products.  I have also used Dermalogica and Philosophy products in the past.  I like those as well but Eminence is my favorite skin care line.  I get plenty of compliments on my skin and questions on what I products I use. I was recently introduced to Eminence products and can't believe the change in my skin, I totally love this and have switched from my Estee Lauder  products. I love this brand. All of it's products are good, mild and non-irritating. I can highly recommend  this brand with full confidence. Amazing face wash, makes my face feel soft, taken away all of the redness I had forming. Defiantly my new favorite purchased for the second time!!! it's been my favorite. I used to have rosacea, but with this magic cleanser, a good serum and sun screen not anymore!!! it really calms my skin. The very best calming cleanser. It totally soothes the rosacia in my skin. This facial wash is just what I need for my rosacea.  Very gentle. Great product I've been using this for 4 years and will use nothing else now. My skin is very sensitive and I have rosacea- this calming light and gentle formula is perfect All of the chamomile products from Eminence are amazing for rosacea. My friend recommended Eminence and I am so glad she did.  Ever since I've been using the cleanser, moisturizer, masque and serums I haven't had one flare up.  Very healing. A wonderful product that does exactly what it claims. I have been using eminence products for years and I will continue to do so. I just wish they would stop raising their prices. That is the only negative. I have very dry, sensitive skin.  It doesn't strip my skin at all.  I don't have nearly as many break outs as before.  Great product! I am a fan of Eminence.  I found them in a spa in Colorado and started using their products.  I have switched around quite a bit with face care products, trying to find the most natural.  I don't use all their products, but have been very happy with cucumber eye gel (more of a cream) and their chamomile cleanser.  I also like that their products appear to be all natural. Best face wash I’ve found for sensitive skin. Only thing that keeps my skin from breaking out.  I have had acne for all my life and had lots of blackheads.  This helps keep everything under control.  I use it wtih the Eminence calm skim moisturizer as well. Lovvvvvvvve this line. I have super sensitive rosacea skin, and this calms it right down. And it lasts forever, so seems expensive but actually it's a bargin! wonderful gentle facial cleanser. Finally a product that i can use with rosacea, cleans and calms redness I have used this and other eminence products for several years now after a visit it a Nashville spa. Great product. Like a face wash and moisturiser all in one. Plus loves my sensitive skin!!!! I love this facial cleaner! My face does not feel dry after using this. I have sensitive skin and no break outs after this . I will order more when I run low:) Excellent for people with sensitive skin. Love this product and have been using for 3 years. Great product. A great cleanser for sensitive, dry skin.  Smells nice and the pump bottle is convenient!  I use this during warmer months and when I breakout and there is no problem.  I'm sticking with this one! Love my eminence skin care supplies, thank you this leaves my skin clean and soft.  buy atamazon for the price and delivery is fast. My face  feels awesome when I wash with this cleanser. Love this product! I first tried it at a spa for my rosecea and it calms and clears the redness!!! Great product with great scent! I love the Eminence line of skin care products.  While I don't use it exclusively, there are a few things I feel they do exceptionally well.  The calming line is one of those exceptional things.  During the winter, my skin tends to be irritable and have a few red areas.  After successfully​ trying the calming moisturizer at night, I took a chance and tried the cleanser.  I love it!  I still feel it may not be perfect at removing all of my makeup, so I have tried it in the morning and gone for a deeper clean at night.  My skin is nice and calm and ready for my serum and moisturizer.. then makeup.  I love starting the day with a happy face!! Quick shipping, great prices I was a stanch Philosophy user until the spa I go to turned me on to Eminence.  What a FANTASTIC product!!  This cleanser actually feels silky smooth and hydrates your skin as it cleans. LOVE this stuff!!  I love how my face feels after using it.  You don't have to use a lot so the bottle lasts for a long time Best product  for sensitive skin. excellent cleanser Love this cleanser for my sensitive skin This product is everything I hoped it would be. Love it for my sensitive skin! Cleansed throughly but very gentle Such a great cleanser for my dry, sensitive skin. I mix this with the rhubarb face scrub, and it works so well. Excelent product for sensitive skin. Keeps my skin vibrant and renewed without irritating it. Item arrived as described & transaction was smooth, easy and fast - Thanks and can highly recommend! My Favorite Helping with my pregnancy acne!! And my Rosey cheeks. Very nice cleanser Arrived very quickly. This product is excellent for sensitive skin/rosacea. Calming and rich but not drying. Excellent product. I love this cleanser.  It's so gentle.  My skin tone is more even and smooth.  The bottle size is also generous Calms my redness right away,nothing works as well. Nice and mild for my red skin.  Haven't found anything better. My favorite cleanser ever! very good This is the only product line I will use on my highly sensitive skin. My dermatologist recommended  this product. It is very concentrated so  last a long time. Great to calm rosacea. wifey loved it! I have tried other products but this is the only one to help with my redness. My skin is softer and clearer. I had a facial at the Park Hyatt Aviara Resort Spa with a Clarisonic Mia. The aesthetician recommended this product to me afterward. I was very happy to see the list of wonderful ingredients but doubted its effectiveness so I tried the sample at home first. Turns out it really works well for my delicate skin, which usually dries out with even a passing breeze. I ordered it from Amazon and I'm happy to have a product with ingredients even better than those at Whole Foods and it works to boot. Nice product, enjoyed it very much Great for my skin, love this product. Everything I have tried from eminence has been amazing! A great light weight cleanser This is a great product for my sensitive, easily inflamed skin! It's very gentle. love it Really does control the red! A+ Perfect cleanser. Non-irritating. I love love love Eminence..if I could I would sell it Love it...... Love it! i love the product and it arrived as expected. i would definitely buy more of this brand from this vendor. I have never been able to find cleanser that does not irritate or dry my skin out. This is the first one I've tried that works as promised. There is a noticeable difference since I've started using it, no red or irritated skin. Great product!! I have been using this for about a year. My skin feels smoother and looks great. There has been some reduction in redness, but nothing super dramatic. The product smells great and it is soothing during use. Great product. This product is very gentle on my skin. I have sensitive skin and most other  products cause acne breakouts on my face. After months of continuous redness and pimples on my nose, which I never had even in high school or during pregnancy, I was fortunate to have a facial by a provider who used and recommended Eminence Calm Skin.  Within a week my skin was clear, the redness was gone, and it's been fine ever since.  When I stopped using it for a couple of days, thinking the problem was solved, it started again.  But a return to the use of Eminence Calm Skin cleared it right up again.  Even my husband noticed!  For my very sensitive skin, this is a keeper!  Highly recommend!!! Love this product. I have rosacea, but since I started using this, along with the moisturizer, my skin is so much better. It's not nearly as red as it used to be, and it's so soft.  I used to get compliments on my ""porcelain"" skin when I was a 20 year old. Now in my fifties, I'm getting compliments again. Thank you Eminence. As you can probably see by the photo is that it is not the first time we have bought this item. It is actually a continuous purchase. My wife swears by it and I use it as well. It does what it is supposed to. I like the way my face feels after using it. For me that is the main reason I use it. It seems to clean well. Without being to harsh on the skin. Unless we come across something better we will be ordering it again and again. I have rosacea and have very sensitive skin. I have to be very careful what I put on my skin. I love this cleanser. It cleanes my skin without drying it out or causing irritation. Very soothing. I also love that it is made with natural ingredients. I usually like to try new things but this is something that I don't change. I highly recommend. I have a lot of broken capillaries in my face (thanks to my mom's genetics) and this has really been great for my skin and some of the redness has calmed down as well! it's not completely gone...but it's much better! love, love, love this! I like this facewash. It has a very nice, light scent. It feels very creamy and velvety on the skin. I have ridiculously sensitive akin and this does not irritate my skin pr dry it out. When it lathers, you get a bit of a cooling sensation and it helps loosen up the gunk/blackheads and wash them out of my pores without being harsh or abbrasive to the skin. A little pricey, but I do think it's made of high-quality ingredients. I've been using Eminence products for quite a few years and the Calm Skin Cleanser is awesome! I've used several different ones in the Eminence line but always go back to the Calm Skin, not because my skin is sensitive but just because it does a great job and makes my skin feel great. I'm buying another one today! Very creamy and perfect for Rosescea prone skin problems it sensitive skin. Lasts a good six months for only a small amount is needed for a make-up removing clean. Amazing product, very gentle on the skin. Great wash for daily use and soothes my red/rosacea skin. I had a facial done at a spa and liked this product very much. I have sensitive skin this was non irritating and calming for my skin. Did not purchase it there because it was expensive. I was very pleased when I found this at a fantastic price. I could not afford to use it for what the spa cost was. My skin was itchy and stinging - I don't know from what - so I ordered this skin calming trio - the Cleanser, Serum, and moisturizer. They are fantastic! I have very sensitive skin and it's been great! No reactions - no itching - no redness. Love them! Love this cleanser! I like this cleanser, it has a nice fragrance.Cleans without drying.  My skin feels moist as if I put a moisturizer on.  I think this will be a keeper. Love this product!"
B0016Q1RI6," Super seller!!! Very happy!!! This is an amazing facial scrub..You can see the difference from your first use. My face looked so clean, bright and soft. very good point Great product, feels very great on the face. I love love love this product!!! I was visiting my daughter in Virginia & took a ride to the mall while she was on duty. They were selling this at a kiosk. To be honest it was all very over priced & usually I would not spend the inflated prices. However about a week prior I made a mental note that my face looked different- not health, kind of gray overtone. I wasn't happy nor did I know what to change or do - I figured well I guess this is what starts happening as you age. So when they grabbed me as I was walking by I was open for a change for my face. They did a demo on me & I was sold because my face just felt cleaner!! Well after just a couple days of using my face looked drastically different. It looked amazing - fresh & alive!!! I no longer resented paying so much & went back to get 4 more tubes because I wasn't sure I would be able to purchase it back home. My daughter brought a couple of her female shipmates to my suite. I was telling them about it & they said go look on Amazon to see if you can find it cheaper. So glad I did cause I found it for less than 1/4 of the price. The kids dragged me back to the mall & I took the other 3 tubes back & ordered them on Amazon!! It is the exact same stuff & works miracles!!! At this price anyone could afford it & enjoy the benefits!!! It has a yummy banana nut scent that smells very natural. I keep it in my shower & use everyday. I also have a tube I keep in my suitcase to make sure I never leave home without it!!! By the way I also use their eye serum & the cream. At the same time I noticed the change in my face after using this I notice my eye area was puffy. I then got the serum & cream for my eye & mouth area Then the cream for all over my face ALL of the products made a difference but this scrub & the eye products were the most dramatic difference I no longer have puffy eyes!!! This line is great & truly works but save your money & get it on Amazon!!! Even their website is over priced!!! I got con into buying so much product from a kiosk in Las Vegas, Mall 10 years back. I must say everything I bought was all junk except this one product. I can tell you how amazing this product has done to my skin.  I have very sensitive and dry skin.  This scrub will not dry you out at all.  The microbeads really remove the dead skin.  I use it about 2 times a week and slather lotion after the shower it keeps my face clean and smooth for days. I no longer buy it at them stands because they will make this product so over priced. You can just get it at Amazon for far more less then them kiosk and not have to be hassle to buy other products. I always return back to Amazon if I need another bottle.  Btw.... it dermatologist approved! I originally bought this product at the mall for my fiance that suffers from severe acne and scaring. He started using it 4 times a week and we saw results within 2 weeks. This thing seriously has helped him a lot. He finished the product and I decided to buy him another one here. Also the price is way better. :) Mild esfoliate, like product. I have used Premier products for some time now and have always been very satisfied with the quality. They are all quite pricey if you purchase them at a specialty kiosk at the mall (as many Amazon customers including myself seem to have originally done before discovering this well kept secret online!)This cleanser is gentle yet very effective. It scrubs, thoroughly cleans, dissolves oil, and washes off clean w/ no residue, odor, or residual dryness. Leaves your skin soft and very clean. Great for combination skin. Definitely plan to continue using it. I now usually order 2 to save on shipping costs since I know I'll use them.Thank you Amazon :) not sure if this stuff is s gimmick or not. but it cleans my face like nothing else. pricey but you only need to use a dab. lasts me awhile. My skin is Oily/Combo and it is very difficult to find something that will work for longer than a week, because of whatever reason other products stop being effective soon after I begin using them. One of the karts at my local mall carries this, and after trying it(and using all of it) for $65 I decided to look on Amazon. You can tell after the second day that this works, makes my skin feel amazingly soft and its not too rough of an exfoliant, but you can tell that it is there. Overall, if you have troubled skin I would suggest this! The product is great! My only problem is that my original purchase was at a kiosk & I was PROMISED there were no nut oils in any of the Dead Sea products!! When I was home & put glasses on, it had ALMOND OIL, my highest allergy!! Even on-line when I checked ingredients, almond oil WAS NOT LISTED!!! I can not use the products I bought because of this!! I first used this product 3 years ago. It was a gift and I didn't try it for nearly a year BUT once I did, MY!! what a difference. My face was happy and looked great! Excellent - just as I expected. I have used this product for a couple of years now.  I love it!  I use it before shaving.  Combined with the Premiere Dead Sea Men's Shave Gel,I get a great shave!  However,due to lack of,American,resellers and availability I may be forced to find a different product!  This is too bad because I really like this product!  I would continue using it if I can find it at a reasonable price from an,American,reseller. I love this product. It is the best thing I have found for my teen's skin. The kiosk is no longer at our mall so I searched online and was happy to find it here on Amazon. The price is MUCH better than anywhere else.  This product lasts a long time and does not irritate the skin. I highly recommend it! Shipping was very fast as well. After a week i noticed a difference and after 2 my face was so clear...never been that clear before...smooth too...my forehead did break out at first but im guessing it was only cause it wasnt used to the product...has gotten better...definitely would recommend I was a proactive user and had a lot of side effects.  It did take the acne away but to keep it away I had to keep using it and it caused dark spots, dry patches and everything else a chemical wash will do over time. I heard about this product with the pink extringent and the problematic acne mask and I am so happy!  My skin has never been softer, no acne and no side effects.  This is all natural stuff, not chemicals and you can see the glow on your skin. I have been waiting for this product to become available again on Amazon.com.  It's a great product because it's two in one--exfoliation and cleansing.  The price on Amazon is much better than at the kiosks in the malls.  This tube lasts almost a year because I use it only every other day.  Rinses cleanly and skin feels great! I love Premier Dead Sea exfoliator.  I use this in the shower and it has a fine scrub effect but with a moisturizing cream feel.  I use it every other day. Both my husband & I have used this product for years . It is excellent & we continue to re-order . EXCELLENT EXFOLIATING my skyn feel soft I love it.Highly recommended  my skyn is sensible this product is perfect .Im glad I bought and tried. I have already purchased this at the mall a year ago after a girl from the Ukraine convinced me to buy it, I had paid well over 19.99 at the time and could not find it anywhere until now, Thank you amazon!This stuff is fantastic and for the price its being sold at right now its really a steal! If you want real results at a budget price this is PERFECT! My favorite cleanser! I have severely dry and acne prone skin. It keeps my skin clean and clear. I have tried a million different things and nothing has ever helped my acne.  This is the one product that wasn't too harsh and actually worked.Just used it once in the morning and once at night and within a few uses, there is improvement.I love this product and will use it for years and years. Best facial clense ever. Makes your skin feel real good when you use it before bed time and wake up with soft skin. Never broke out using this.2nd time buying this. One of the best facial products & it doesn't leave ur skin dry. I have been using this product for over a year now.  I first purchased it from a fancy boutique and it was pricy.  I fell in love with the product and searched on line for it.  This product will make your skin look radient.  A little dab goes a long way. This is a favorite among my beauty products. great service - great product Been using this product for over 5 years. Love it. Love this scrub. After using it your skin feels so smooth and its doesn't irritate the skin. Excellent facial cleanser and exfoliation product all in one. Never would have been able to afford it if it wasn't for Amazon. It's the real deal and it's wonderful. I have used Dead Sea products for some time. I love all of their products. I understand what part of the world it's coming from and it takes some time to get here, but it is well worth the wait. I like the cleansing & moisture this product provides.  I've been using it for over a year now.  It totally meets my expectations. Awesome product been using it for years. Very difficult to find except on amazon.  Lol.  Always seem to clear my face. I buy this all the time. Best exfoliating scrub ever.  Just need a little.  Love it I never buy crap like this, but this stuff is awesome! Have sensitive skin and have looked high and low for the perfect facial cleanser? Look no damn more. Not only does this stuff have your face smelling like strawberries BUT it only helps treat acne and leaves your face looking and feeling softer and smoother than a babies bottom. REAL TALK. Packaged well, fast delivery & accurate. Great price for product Great everyday gentle scrub. Absolutely wonderful product. I use this product to wash my face every day and it's amazing how my skin has improved. My face feels smooth and fresh, not dried anymore, and even black heads have disappeared. The texture of this product is like a moisturizer, and you can tell that it is made with fine natural ingredients of high quality. Thank you, Premier Dead Sea for such a great product. This is the EXACT PRODUCT they sell at Kiosks in the Malls for $50-70!! This facial scrub I've used for years, and I'm telling a TRUE story....I believe it's what makes people argue that I'm 10 years younger than I TELL them I am! We love this product and keep it in stock in our house at all times. We love the other Premier products as well. Using it daily makes all the difference. We highly recommend it!!! I really like how my skin feels after I use this exfoliator!  Also, it doesn't see to bother my skin in any way or make it feel dry afterwards.  Very nice product!  Glad it is for sale here on Amazon! One of these lasts me around three to five months washing my face once in the morning and once at night. I like it and don't use anything else. I think it gets my skin very clean without drying it out or irritating it. Very super item!!!! I like it!!!! Love this product! I was very glad to find this on Amazon, because where I first purchased this was no longer selling it. I have weird skin & this is the only face wash that has stopped breakouts and improved my skin quality, Love it! Works better for me than any other facial brand soap or scrub. This order was well received and i am planning to order more from this seller. This is a great product and I received excellent customer service from Amazon! Received item as described and very quick. Highly recommended. Great facial exfoliating gel. Isn't too harsh like some products on the market, really have gotten the best results from this product. Only use it twice a week and it love it! Very good product.  My 22 year old son uses it daily to help with acne. Works great I use it once or twice every 3 months. It keeps me feeling good after so much time shaving... I would recommend this product to my closest friends and family... Great stuff. Makes your face feel smooth and wonderful Love Premier and Gratiae. Ships to US Territories and APO/FPO addresses. Excellent! I first bought this product in Spain and loved it.  Looked for it online and luckily found it.  Makes my skin so soft and younger looking.  I highly recommend this for your face. Love the product Premier Dead Sea Para-pharmaceutical exfoliating Facial Gel is fantastic.  I bought this is a local mall but felt it was over priced.  The sales clerk did give me a deal.  I bought the eye serum, which is wonderful and she gave me a deal for the facial gel and a mud bar.  This was a decision I made on the spur of the moment.  I loved this Premier product.  I then found the eye serum and the wonderful exfoliating gel on line at Amazon.  I always use Amazon.  They are consisting professional in helping you get products for yourself and for gifts.This was sent to me from Isreal.  Larry Barr is a very nice man.  I got a good deal, much better than the local mall.  I will definitely recommend this scrub for all facial types.  I have combo skin.  I'm in my early 60s, but tend to take card of my skin.  People compliment on my youthful look.  Try this gel and Premier products.  You will not be disappointed. Amazing stuff....cleans and smooths imperfections! arrived on time  I like this product it leaves my skin so soft  you would really like it too this company products are above the others try them I thought this stuff was pretty good, but my sister in law loved it when she tried mine. I may get this for all the women in my life for the holidays. The product arrived in a timely manner and was exactly what I expected! I love this face scrub! Used it before but paid waaay more at the mall. 5 stars all the way around. This gel works great.  I've been using it for years. It only takes a small amount to feel as if you have had an expensive facial.  I use it twice a week...but sometimes sneak in another time during the week. Love this stuff! I tried this product at a mall so I decided to come home and order my own. My face feels real good after use. Excellent Excellent This is an exfoliating gel which I use as a cleanser because ir cleanse and at the same time it removes cells. I love it for my skin looks super. This actually works. Great product from Israel (Dead Sea). It cleared my dry skin but I still keep using it. Great productd; would order again I use the entire premier care collection.  this scrub is great!  I use it a few times a week.  it really cleanses the skin. great product ! The item arrived as promised I have loved Premier Dead Sea products for a long time.  This Exfoliating Facial Gel is one of my favorites. great exfoliator, cleans skin well and balanced. gentle yet effective on oily skin. helps clean pores well, steam your face first for best results This is my absolute new favorite. This cleanser does not dry out my skin and leaves my skin so clean and clear! I love this face wash. My skin is soft, vibrant, and it does NOT dry  out my skin. Helps vlear and prevent breakouts. premier products are fantastic, i like this one compared to other brands. my face feel refreshed and clean. the price is also fantastic it rily works..clears up my pimple marks rily quick. and smells so good. It doesnt leave burning sensation on the face Love!!! Great Great Item This is a repeat buy! My daugther also loves this product so I bought her two more containers for Christmas. I love this product.  After using it I love the way my face feels.  The dead sea mineral bring a glow to my face. I always buy this product on a regular basis. I would not hesitate to purchase the product again. This product is great. I normally use Dermanew on my skin as an exfoliator and I love it but I thought I would give this a try as the price was one third of what I pay for the Dermanew.  It works beautifully on my skin and leaves it feeling soft and ultra smooth.  It does just as good a job and for a whole lot less...always a good thing...and I get more product for my money and it lasts a long time as I only need to use a small dollop of product...another plus! Love this tsuff I have to say that this is the first exfoliating gel that leaves my skin smooth and soft.  Most of these type of products tend to dry out my skin, but this one seems to manage to avoid that. It rinses off easily too.  I like to alternate this with the Premier Dead Sea Milk Cleanser. This stuff scrubs so well. And weirdly enough, it feels like it's doing a much bettter job when I scrub with my bare fingers, instead of with the washcloth. My skin is so smooth, foundation when I put on my face looks way smoother now and like don't need concealer. Won't be disappointed with this one. Love the product my skin us sensitive and this is awesome for me... This is a great product, have been using it for more than a year, highly recommended. This stuff works AWWEESOOMMMEEE! My boyfreind told me about this product, so I figured I'd try it!! You only put a lil drop to use on your face and it goes a LONG WAY. I love how deep down it gets to clean my face. This bottle will last a looooooooooong time. The ""sand grit""  stuff doesnt dissolve really fast like other facial cleansers do. You can wash forever and still have the ""sand grit"" still working to clean your face. And after your done, ur face feels so SMOOTH AND CLEAN and my husband loves how my face feels.. so thanks to my boyfreind.I use like every 4 days. Try it. I know you'll love it!! I know I do and I love my boyfreind  Curt too........mmmmmmm lol this is a good product. It makes your face feel good. It was shipped at a timely speed.it is a good product for the price. Normally, I wait at least a month to review a product, but I'm so astounded with this product that I have to review after using it ONCE! Let me start by saying that I have combination skin. I have extremely dry skin around my mouth and oily skin on my cheeks and nose with large pores. I've tried many products for combination skin, but like EVERY other product out there, it either leaves my cheeks greasy or around my mouth dry. My main issue is my large pores that are very noticeable.My skin routine consists of washing my cheeks, forehead and nose with a pore refining exfoliator. Then use a wash cloth to scrub my nose because it's prone to black heads. I avoid washing around my mouth with anything other than water because it's so dry. When I dry my face, I'll scrub lightly on my nose again with a towel. I then use toner on my cheeks, nose and forehead, again avoiding around my mouth. Then I moisturize my face. After that, I moisturize around my mouth again and sometimes put lotion on that spot if it's still too dry. After letting it dry, I'll put on makeup.Now that you know the crazy routine I go through, let me tell you that the only thing I changed was the exfoliator. I didn't realize this when I bought it, but this is not made with soap. I have shampoo like that for my pets (soap-less shampoo) but it never even crossed my mind that they can do that with cleansers and exfoliators. I thought it was perfect, I NEED something that doesn't have soap! This time I washed my entire face with this.I have never felt my face so clean before! I mean, I do at home facials and use masks, but I have never felt it like THIS! Usually after washing my face, I can feel right away that around my mouth is dry. I didn't feel that this time, at least not nearly as badly. I also didn't feel the need to scrub my nose with the towel. I did the toner, as usual. This time when I moisturized, I only had to do around my mouth ONCE! And my cheeks didn't look greasy, like it actually did the day before. My skin was so even, it was glowing. It improved the appearance of my pores so much that if I didn't know better, I would've thought I was wearing makeup. I actually sat there and stared at my skin because I couldn't believe the transformation of my pores. Seriously, I went from orange peel to almost normal.I'm so impressed with this product, it's almost like they made it specifically with me in mind. I couldn't dream of anything more perfect for my skin. I actually forgot how much I paid for it and saw that I actually pay just as much for my other exfoliator that is specifically intended to improve the appearance of pores. That exfoliator does a fraction of the performance this does. And it smells so good! I couldn't recommend this more for people with large pores and combination skin! I am 46 and still have acne. I am allergic to acne products containing salicylic acid (which is most of them!). Due to my age, I also need a cleanser that is hydrating. I am so grateful that I have found this product! I use it everyday and finally my skin is clear and soft. The exfoliating apricot seeds are very small and fine. They do not irritate my skin compared to other cleansers such as St. Ives. In addition, the cleanser is somehow non-greasy, although it contains a variety of oils. Now that I know Amazon sells this product at such a reasonable price, I will be purchasing it here from now on. I hope this review has been helpful to others who suffer with adult acne. Dead sea is my new favorite facial/cleansing product. I'm 22 now, and I have had acne since I was 13 or something. Throughout the years, I tried several products, at least three of those strong skin treatments with support of dermatologists, and several others of the ones you can find at your local pharmacy.However, this one is the best I found so far. It's very dense, so it lasts a LOT. I use it regularly, once a week, and it has helped my skin improve a lot. It's not too strong, it does not make my skin, which is very sensitive, itch or hurt, and it still feels clean and fresh after the shower.I recommend it a lot.Of course it's not gonna solve all your problems. You still have to use sunscreen, moisturizer, eat healthy etc etc, but for a exfoliant it's both effective and soft at the same time. I am in my early 30's and still suffer from acne.  It's most like I have to have a pimple some where on my face at all times.  I have tried everything, ProActiv, Clinque, all those store bought products, home remedies and nothing worked as quickly and effectively as this.  I found it in my boyfriend's closet, and have thanked him every day since.I have oil/dry skin, so it's complicated.  This wash works for both my dry and oily areas.  I have noticed now when I get a pimple if I just rub a little extra in that area the redness and swelling of the pimple go down in about 24 hours.  It is important to use it 2x a day, especially with my oily skin. It's not a soap so you won't have to worry about drying out your skin from overuse.Overall I am happy with this product.....I am just praying that my skin doesn't get use to it and stop working :(#fairskinproblems Yes. Yes. Yes. Great product. Works wonders for my skin, it is my new facial go to. I do facials once a week on Monday and I feel fresh for the whole week with this one I originally bought a tube from a vendor at a mall, paying a small fortune.  The gel works beautifully so I researched it and bought the next tube from somewhere in Israel online.  Finding it on Amazon for a fraction of the cost has been great.  This gel keeps my face clean and smooth and I would recommend it to anyone! I use this product once a week for more than three years now.It works just great, removing the dead skin cells and unclogging the pores, thus preventing any ""inflammation"" on your face. Smells very nice too. Only small amount is needed, so it lasts a long time.Very satisfying. Highly recommend. First bought this product at the mall, for me one tube lasted about a year. This was the first face skin care product I'd used besides proactive (didn't work), along with a water-based moisturizer by the Onsen brand (with a skin peel I never used, and they were expensive, but I figured I'd give it a shot.)The scent is subtle, and doesn't linger around which is good. My best time to use it is after shaving, as it soothes razor burn, and seems to prevent any shaving-related acne. I'll just let it sit for a few minutes before washing it off, not sure what it is, but after shaving it feels great. I follow up currently with the Nourishing Cream ""For Men"" also from Premier. It's a bit too oily, but okay in the winter. For the summer I'm still looking for a good water-based lotion.Good product. Definitely useful. This cleanser is gentle enough for regular use and leaves your face very clean. The product smells excellent as well. Everything arrived quickly and everything was as expected. Love this product.  Smells great.  Although gritty texture, feels good to face & neck when applied.  Leaves skin feeling clean and fresh after use."
B01MRVHFIA," Nice light sent.  Cleans without over drying.  Great for aging skin I really like this face wash because it doesn't leave my face feeling excessively dry after I wash it.  There's not a real strong scent to the product either and using just a little goes a long way. I don't even have to use a full pump to clean my face so I think it'll last me a longer time. I'm pretty sure I'll order another one once this is empty though. This is a very nice facial cleanser. I have oily skin and it helps control my breakouts and blemishes. It leaves my face gentle, clean, and my pores smaller. I have sensitive skin and break out easily.  This Kaiame Naturals Cleanser is great.  Love how it's all natural and organic.  Feels nice against the skin and leaves face feeling clean. Has a nice scent and feels soothing.  Give this facial cleanser a try. I've been using someone from my local Walmart, which has been fine, but I like to change up my facial cleansing routine. I saw this product, like the packaging, and decided to give it a try. I'm very happy with it. It cleans very well and it seems a little goes a long way. I'm so happy I decided to purchase this one and I'll be ordering again for me and one for my mom. I have been looking for a good organic facial cleanser that works well. I found Kaiame Naturals Gentle Facial Cleanser and gave it a try. I love the light scent . It smells clean and fresh, lathers up lightly, and rinses to leave your face feeling  perfect. It's nice because it leaves your face soft and supple and not dry like some cleansers that I have used before. I will continue to purchase this product. I really love this face wash! I try to use all natural products and had not found a face wash as nice as this! The secent is light and deliciate yet it transports me to the spa! A little goes a long way and my face feels softerthan ever ! I feel safe knowing the oranic ingreedients are good for me. Will be getting more when I run out! My first impression if KAIAME NATURALs (after the lovely packaging)was what a nice and gentle fragrance this had...not perfumey or medicinal...very nice texture and was very silky when I rubbed it between my thumb and fingers...it was very nice to use on my face..it gave me a good feeling literally washing away the days' daily grime from my face before bed... I have always used a cleanser,  but it always left my face too dry,  so that i needed to put a toner right away to hydrate.  This is  a great cleanser,  It already leaves my skin soft ready for my daily routine. And looking at the ingredients, I see all the benefits that this cleanser has over other ones.  A winner! This stuff really is gentle as the listing says. I really love this stuff. My wife has been teasing me about my new wrinkles. So I bought this and another product and it seems to be doing the trick. This stuff cleans my face, the other stuff is an anti aging cream I am using. they compliment each other well. My wife loves this.  She has sensitive skin and this is super gentle and effective! I'm not a fan of washing my face at night because I'm so tired when the day is over, however, I look forward to using this cleanser because it is so refreshing.  I love that it doesn't dry my face out and I'm super excited that it is all natural!  You owe it to yourself to give this face wash a try! This gentle facial wash is a must have, it includes organic ingredients. I have been using this for about a week. When you apply it to your face, you will experience a cool sensation and after the wash, your face will definitely have a clean smooth  and silky feeling. I am very satisfied with the product and will buy again. I'm really happy with this all natural, gentle cleanser.  I've always had problematic skin and had a difficult time finding a cleanser that would properly clean without drying out.  This one is effective and strong, yet sensitive enough to not irritate.  I've been having great results so far! This is a wonderful natural and gentle facial cleanser.  I use it every morning and the fresh scent helps me to wake up and start my day!  At my age, a lot of cleansers tend to dry out my skin, but this does not at all, instead  it leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth and ready for my morning routine. Love this face wash! It has a light pleasant smell and has a gentle exfoliating feel that leaves my face feeling soft and refreshed. It only takes a small amount so this bottle is definitely going to last.  I love that it is organic and free from all the parabens and sulfates.  Great product! This is a natural and gentle facial wash. It is gentle on the skin, the scent is sublte and not overpowering. I love the organic and natural ingredients. It leaves my face feeling refreshed and clean but not dry and tight as with some other products. Good product! I love that this face wash doesn’t dry my face and that it’s all natural! Works great!!! I really like this face wash because it doesn't leave my face feeling excessively dry after I wash it. There's not an extremely strong scent to the product and using just a little goes a long way. You feel nice and refreshed after using it. I got this for use by everyone at my house and its worked very well.  We all have different skin types and none of us has had any complaints.  It is a great gentle cleanser with some of the best ingredients, olive, chamomile and aloe Vera. My wife developed some acne after pregnancy. So she bought a cuple of acne face washer, however these product dried out her face in unaffected areas . So we found Kaiame and is been working for her excellent, because it's acting on her acne without drying her face . I have been searching for a face cleanser that wouldn't irritate my super sensitive skin....this one is great!  I love that there aren't any harsh chemicals....it smells really nice and leaves my skin feeling very refreshed.  Definitely recommend! We purchased this 2 weeks ago and have been using this daily. My fiance has very sensitive skin and this has been a godsend for him. It's gentle without irritating his skin and helps with his skin's oil control. I've been using this as well and it's help with my breakout control. I love how the cleanser doesn't emit a strong smell and it provides a good clean feel. this is a great face cleanser. My skin breaks out easily and this wash is gentle enough that it doesn't, but leaves it feeling clean. its very calming on my skin and helps reduce my redness. i can use it in the am and the pm and its very hydrating. smells wonderful too. I suffer from dry skin and decided to try this product as it has lots of natural ingredients. I have been using for 3 weeks and have been surprised that my skin has improved. Its kind to the skin and smells nice also This is wonderful! It feels so refreshing. Kind of wakes up my face and leaves my skin feeling soft. The peppermint in it is amazing! And I love that it is organic ingredients. Will definitely purchase again! I purchased this product a few weeks ago but I wanted to wait before providing a review.  I normally use a natural organic cleanser from a known line that is good but very expensive.  I have to admit not only did I like this cleanser but I actually prefer it over the one I used before this one.  It is good at removing makeup, it leaves my skin feeling clean but not dry.  A little goes a long way and it lathers very well.  I will certainly continue to use this cleanser in the future. Gentle and soothing wash, love the smell of it, refreshing and it leaves my face clean and smooth. I am enjoying this every day and it leaves my face feeling real clean and soft. Very good product indeed. This is definitely a good facial wash. I love how it contains natural and moisturizing ingredients like shea butter and olive oil, the peppermint oil is also a plus as its gives a refreshing feeling while cleansing your face. I plan on buying again! This facial wash is ever so gentle and has a sweet faint scent. I love the way it lathers. My face feels clean when I rinse but not dry. my skin feels refreshed and clean. It's perfect for my sensitive skin. I really like this face wash!  I was looking for a gentle face wash that would not dry out my skin, an this cleanser did exactly that!  It has a light peppermint smell to it, most likely from the organic peppermint essential oil.  It creates a very light lather, which is expected since there is no chemical foaming agent in this face wash. LOVE this cleanser. Smells great, very gentle and refreshing. Love how it feels on the skin. You only need a small amount to wash the face too so I think this bottle will last me for some time. Highly recommend! I love this Kaiame facial cleanser! Finally found something that has cleared up my acne! Love the fact that it contains natural product. This is my second bottle, will keep purchasing. This face wash made my face feel smooth and clean without the drying feel. It feels like it removes all traces of makeup making my skin feel really nice. It works without all the harsh chemical! My dad gave this to me recently so I gave it a try. Worked pretty well and as easy on my skin especially on my face.  I cannot find any fault with it so probably will buy it in the future. I absolutely love this product! I use this cleanser in the morning when I'm getting ready to start my day and it gives such a refreshing feeling on my face. My daughter loves it as well, her face is sensitive and because it is natural it doesn't affect her skin. Very happy with this product thank you! First time using this and I am totally impressed.  You only need a little and it goes a long way.  I have dry skin and this cleanser is very gently on my skin.  Will definitely order again. This leaves my skin feeling clean and is not drying. It does not have an overly strong scent either. I have sensitive skin and so far I have not had any issues using this particular product. Every time I use a cleanser. it is either causes over dryness or it leaves a greasy feeling, until I found this brand recommended by a friend. It is great product, has a great minty smell. it is the first cleanser I use doesn't cause itching My wife loves it. It is gentle on her skin which exactly what she was looking for. We will definetly be re ordering this. She loves it. Wife and I both used this product over the last few days. She loves it and I think it does a good job of getting my face clean of all the dried skin. Natural product is a key thing for us! My wife uses this every day, and swears by it!! She says it removes ALL her makeup, and leaves her face feeling ""As clean as its ever been"". She couldnt be happier with her purchase! My face loves this cleanser so much. I totally purchased it at random but I'm so thankful I did as it's cleared up my face amazingly. I'm not a huge fan of the smell but it's such a great cleanser that it doesn't bother me. And I love the cooling sensation it gives, makes my skin feel really clean. I will definitely continue to purchase this product! A great face cleanser. Comparable and slightly more refreshing than another more famous brand used before. None abrasive on my skin and keeps my face feel clean and fresh. Having roseacea, I have to be careful what I use on my face and this cleanser works wonderfully. I love the refreshing feeling it leaves afterwards from the peppermint oil! I don't like to post reviews but I feel that I have to. I hate my Very sentivie skin cause I can't wear any simple product and many times I spent money & dried my skin wearing other products BUT, this cleanser is awesome! Doesn't dry my skin, makes very clean and soft. Please do not change the ingredients cause it's perfect like that, I will keep buying it. Don't make me try an other product please. I live this one! I have a hard time finding something that does not break my face out when I take my makeup off. This is very good. No problems at all. This is very good. Smells good and light, not a heavy fragrance. Kaiame Naturals Gentle Facial Cleanser is smooth going on and gentle for my skin. I would defiantly buy this product again. Soo Happy to have finally found a great Organic Cleanser at a reasonable price that is gentle enough for my very sensitive skin.  Many others I have tried often make my skin turn pink and I often break out.  I have been using this one for a few weeks now and it has worked perfectly for me:) The customer service was great.  I received an email prior to my receiving the product, letting me know it was on the way and to let them know if I had any questions.The product is great.  I read reviews and the product description, so I was well aware it did not contain the chemical magic that produces a super foamy cleanser.  It removed all my makeup and my skin felt soft afterwards.  I tend to dry out easily, but this stuff actually helped my dryness.  I will definitely be back. Really nice gentle, slightly exfoliating face wash...feels fresh and cool on the skin and is very gentle!  I am on my second bottle...workd beautifully for ""mature"" skin! I really enjoy using this.

Great product My skin is glistening Best product of used on my face hands down!! Really good Excellent product! I've purchased many facial cleansers over the years and this brand has proven to be on the same scale as very expensive brands. So, for those of you that want the same results as the more expensive product, save yourself some money and purchase this! I am really impressed with this facial cleanser. My face feels great after each use and the fragrance is just right and not overpowering like many other brands. My wife is a wonderful wife and mother, and works so hard at taking care of our two young sons. I decided to treat her to some nice facial cleanser, and saw that this had natural and organic ingredients, which we are all about. My wife has tried a lot of different skincare products, with pretty ho-hum reactions to them. However, she absolutely LOVES this stuff. She came out of the bathroom after washing her face with it for the first time smiling and touching her skin, saying how good it felt. Good enough for me! Happy wife, happy life! Wow! I love this cleanser. Lately I have developed rough patches on my forehead and the sides of my cheeks, I used this cleanser for the fist time and couldn’t believe how the rough patches disappeared, no other cleanser has done this. I have also noticed the cleansers I used before caused redness of my skin this one didn’t. I guess I must be allergic to certain products.I will gladly order this product again. I'm not a big fan of facial cleansers bc my skin gets a bit sensitive with some of the ingredients. I tried this brand and I was really happy with how my skin felt afterwards. Living in Houston, between wearing make up and the daily humidity, my face always feels between sand paper and a slip-n-slide. I'll definitely use this again. I loves how my face feels after washed. My husband is a car salesman. His face got so dull from sun exposure and he never use any facial product. I kinda force him to try this one.  He was not gonna try at all. But he finally did it to make me shut up about it lol. He actually loves it.. and I find the bottle on his side of the sink now. I guess I have to give him this one and get another bottle of this gem for myself. This cleaner is amazing! I'm very picky about my skincare and this one is amazing...I have sensitive skin and need a formulation that is natural and gentle. It has two of my favorite ingredients inside which is aloe and olive and other soothing ingredients inside. I would highly recommend this cleanser to anyone looking for a cleanser that cleans well and gentle at the same time! I bought this for my wife and she's been saying its cleansing so much better then other products she's been using, I can tell her skin is allot smother and she's also saying it removes her make up pretty well...I've also been using it past few days and I like it as well cleanses really well and refreshes the skin....Need to get another one soon...Definitely a good product, I recommend it. I Felt the cooling effect of chamomile and other organic ingredients😊; its really refreshing and soft on the skin ! I used it  alone or / with my clarisonic face cleansing tool and it works perfect. It left my skin clean & smooth  ( (With only little amount ) works wonder on my skin. I Love this product ❤️ I have been looking for a gentle facial wash.  I really like this cleanser.  This cleanser cleanses the face without stripping the oils of the face so it is truly gentle.  I have used the cleanser with an electric brush and also with just my hands and both seem to do a good job of cleaning my face.  I enjoy the peppermint scent as well , it is refreshing.  I also agree that all you need is a 1/2 pump, a little does go a long way. I'm surprised to be writing a review for a face cleanser, but I really like this stuff. Feels and smells like something you'd find at a high-end spa. I bought this for my wife and so far she has used it everyday and says she loves it!  She says she absolutely loves the smell and how easily it removes her makeup. I bought this for her because of all the all natural and organic ingredients, I figured would help as we are getting older now. My wife suggested I give this product a try as well so will update you on that. I'm just happy she loves the product! Great Face wash! It doesn't leave my face as dry as other products when I wash it. It's great for my sensitive skin as it's not too strong and there's really no perfumes in it either. Just as small scent but nothing too much. It leaves my face feeling clean and I like it! Pretty good -- it seems like a good basic cleanser. I'm not personally fond of how it smells, it has a relatively strong herbal scent like tea tree oil. There's no tea tree oil on the ingredients list though, so it's probably just the scent of the chamomile+peppermint oil. This is a great product! I use this cleanser every day. It has a nice clean natural scent and hasn’t caused my sensitive skin to break out. My skin feels squeaky clean after washing with this. You don’t need a lot, it’s quite thick. I definitely recommend This cleanser feels good and really gives my skin and clean and smooth feeling. I use it in the shower every morning and I have incorporated it into my daily skin regimen!  I highly recommend you give this cleanser a try! My skin is very sensitive, so I was looking for a facial cleanser that with gentle, natural ingredients. This cleanser is perfect, and I really like the natural, botanical scent. Will purchase again. Face washes are hit or miss for me since I have really sensitive skin and rosacea. This one worked nicely and didn't irritate my skin! :) Really liked the smell too. Will buy again! My daughter convinced me that I needed to use a gentle face cleanser instead of soap and water.  I hate to admit this but she was right.  This fits the bill. Great size, like the pump dispenser for easy portioning.  Even like the bottle design, doesn't look cheap.  Product is gentle and has a decent scent. Nice face wash.  I have been using this for a month now and very much enjoy it. Very refreshing and not harsh. Absolutely LOVE this face wash. It leaves my face feeling so nice, clean and smooth. Would highly recommend!! I really love this face cleaner. It leaves a fresh feeling after using it. I have used many skin facial cleansers in the past, but I will have to say this is my favorite! I recommended to everyone wanting fresher, younger looking skin! Nice smell and it is a great gentle cleanser. I keep it in the shower and use it daily. Very nice! This cleanser is the best I have ever used. Leaves skin feeling soft, clean & fresh. High quality cleanser. Love this! Great soap. Love the smell. I have sensitive dry skin and this worked great for me. nice smell and feel. It works. I like it. Gentle and cleansing i love this soap Cleansing and refreshing <3 The Kaiame Naturals Gentle Facial Cleanser provides a gentle feel on your face after washing your face thoroughly. This is important to me since I am allergic to most facial product. It comes in a 6fl oz bottle, and it contains a minty fresh smell. Hopefully, as I continue using it, I will see wonderful results. This face wash does a great job of cleansing and keeping acne and pimples down. Since my gdaughter started using it, she has not had a breakout. Great product, washes without feeling greasy. Smells nice, too. Gentle yet refreshing love this. Leaves face feeling great. As a breast cancer survivor its very important to me that the products I use are free of parabens, sulfates and phthalates so I am always looking for great products that fit the bill. This facial wash is awesome. It is incredibly refreshing but very gentle. The fragrant makes it a perfect was for the whole family as it is not gender specific. I highly recommend  Kaiame natural cleanser and will purchase again! I like this. It is not greasy and leaves my face nice & soft. Love this face wash, it takes very small amount to wash off all the make up, smells really good too! Best Facial Cleanser!  I love, love love this!  Definitely gentle and leaves face feeling clean!!!! Gentle product on my skin and cleans very effectively!  Love that it does not contain harsh ingredients. I just recently opened it, so I haven't used it for a long time, but it is nice.  Good smell and feels good on my face.  Thanks!"
B01MFAELGC," Absolutely love Tula products. My skin feels so soft and clean afterward. It's like yogurt for my face... so cleansing! So far I have been super happy with these products!  I wanted to get the travel size to test it out before I committed to buying the full size and I love it!  Will definitely continue to use these products. I have tried many face products and spent lots of money.  I really do like this product.  I have only used it for five weeks, but I do see a difference.  My face has a glow that it hasn't had in awhile, and my skin feels a litter tighter also. I have really enjoyed these products so far. My face looks brighter and feels more clean and soft. I have pretty sensitive combination skin and so far I have no complaints..it is gentle but yet effective and doesn't break out my skin. I will be buying more of this product in the future Shin care that actually works! Bravo! I love this new line of skincare! The first thing I noticed was how moisturized my skin felt using the Day/Night cream. I love the science behind it too! Can't wait to see long term results! I would definitely recommend giving this a try! These products are amazing! Have been using them for almost 2 weeks and my skin is soft and smooth. The hydrating cream is great for winter time because my skin is normally flakey and this works  great. Can’t wait to try more products My husband bought this kit for me for Christmas! It's the first times in a year something hasn't bothered my sensitive skin😍 I woke up with my face looking clearer, brighter and very hydrated! Looking forward to loving my skin again! I saw a difference after the 1st day.  My skin was smoother and softer and I could tell my skin would love these products.  So far so good.  Now I've ordered other items in the line! Great ,my face looks wonderful Favorite skin care product!! I order straight with TULA now. You can normall find a discount code! Love how my skin feels with this product! My wife Loves the products. Especially the serum. Great product!  My face feels so much smoother and my skin resilient. The best line of skincare products I've ever used. Love it so far!!!! I have awful skin. Seriously awful especially for someone who is middle aged. Red, rashy, flakey, dry and all that. There was a noticeable difference after the first wash and it’s gotten even better. If you figure I was at 100 flakes on my skin, I am down to maybe 5. I will update after the first month is over.First month nearly over and my skin has been transformed. I have tried every product known to man...seriously; organic, regular, products for sensitive skin and prescription creams and none of them have really ever worked. I purchased the whole routine ( had to get it direct from Tula bcz Amazon doesn’t have all the products) and my skin is soft, flake-free and a uniform color. It’s balanced without oily spots and whatever acne I had on my nose is gone. I am convinced it has been worth every penny and once you get into normal sizes it really isn’t any more expensive than other products I have used.A lady working the ticket counter at the airport the other day said I had beautiful skin...no one has ever said that to me before. Thank you Tula products. Even though I'm not even 30 yet, I've noticed some crow's feet around my eyes and some lines on my neck and forehead deepening. When I saw this set I decided to give it a try! I have combination skin and tend to get oily in some areas with dry patches around my nose, between my eyebrows, and on my chin. These products give my skin so much moisture without leaving me oily!! Even as the months get hotter, my skin really is loving the formula. The wrinkle defense serum is so light and I especially see a difference on my neck and forehead, where my lines are deepest. I follow it with the day/night moisturizer (just a few dots go a long way for my skin in the morning!). I put on a little bit more of the moisturizer at night in areas that are more prone to dryness. The eye cream is pretty standard - I haven't noticed that much of a difference, but it totally is moisturizing and doesn't irritate my skin! Lastly, the face wash might be one of my favorite to date. I especially appreciate how it can take off my mascara, though for some waterproof formulas it takes a bit more rubbing it definitely still works!! Overall, I would definitely want a full size of the cleanser and the serum. Although I'd like to see if the moisturizer keeps holding up during the summer months, it's a wonderful formula that I can envision will replace my current night cream!! Every year or two my skin (unfortunately) gets ""used to"" whatever product line I'm using that works, and it's back to the same old nasty breakouts (especially when my hormones come into play).Recently, my skin started getting worse and the cystic acne I was getting when hormonal was painful and annoying. I decided it was time to switch skincare again.I read the reviews and wanted to try this out... I've been using it a few weeks now and so far it's been amazing. Hormones this month didn't give me ANY blemishes, which hasn't happened in at least 6 months. I love the smell of the face wash in particular but wish the sizes were bigger. I think I will buy the full size once I'm running low. Tried these products on the recommendation of a blogger Paleomg.  Went with the trial sized first because the products are a little on the pricey side.  My skin is in the best state its been in years.  It doesn't have any fragrance to it that I notice.  I didn't use the cleanser very often because I'm still very in love with my Charcoal Bar from Beauty Counter.  I will be ordering the full sized versions of these products and trying out some of Tula's other options. It's refreshing to see this new line of skincare emerge from a market that is currently oversaturated with brands touting themselves as ""all-natural"" or ""clean"". I'm consistently a shameless consumer of such brands (hey, how do you know until you've tried it?!), but I'm happy to say that Tula may actually be one of the few that are true to their word - with results to prove it. This particular set has a few perks - it's travel-friendly (perfect for a quick weekender trip), the bright packaging and logo is sleek and minimal (yes, I'm also a sucker for packaging), perfect for a trial test run of the Tula  brand, before you commit to the normal sized products, smell is fragrant enough, without being too overpowering - but my favorite part is how each product absorbs and transforms the skin. I've yet to find a line of skincare that feels like it's working, without feeling/looking overly greasy and oily, especially as I've gone from normal to oily combination skin with age. From the cleanser, wrinkle serum, eye cream, and day/night cream, everything in this set goes on light, weightless, and leaves you with a dewy, soft glow. Only downside is how quickly I'll fly through this set. For the last few months, I have been hearing friends talk about TULA and finally decided to take the plunge when I saw this set. I am 26 years old and have recently noticed that my skin is changing. Any moisturizer used to be fine for keeping my dry skin relatively hydrated all day, but recently I have noticed that the moisture isn't sticking around very long on my skin. It felt like every few hours I would need to reapply, and the increased dryness is making my fine lines more prominent. I tried the TULA set, and I am very impressed with the line. The moisturizer is my favorite. My skin looks so glowy (but not greasy) when I put it on and the radiance stays. I don't need to reapply after a few hours. I also have enjoyed layering the serum under the moisturizer to help disguise some of my fine lines that have been becoming more visible due to dryness. The eye cream absorbs quickly, and makes it so that my fine lines around my eyes are staying moisturized. The face wash was fun to try, but I didn't love it as much as I loved the other three products. Overall, I give TULA  5/5. Their products did what they said they were going to do. This skincare line is fantastic. I personally love getting travel sized products because it means my skin doesn't suffer when I'm on the road. This little kit is perfect because it's a high end line that's lightweight and easy to pop in a carry on bag. My favorite part of the set is probably the cleanser because it smells so fresh and clean and leaves my face feeling healthy and dewy, but the eye cream is really nice too. Not too heavy. Not too light. Five stars, definitely recommend if you're looking to try a new anti-aging face cream. Tula is my new fave!!!  I like the fact that there is one cream for day and night.  Many products for women of a certain age seem to focus on only wrinkles.  Retinal products tend to dry my skin too much making my skin feel older.  Tula makes my skin soft and and hydrated.  Very, very noticeable improvement!!!  Thank you, Tula I'm so glad I tried these out! I've heard lots of people talking about this brand and it definitely lives up to the hype. All of the products are very gentle and didn't irritate my skin or break me out. The eye cream feels really nice and doesn't make my eyes sting at all which lots of other brands do. The moisturizer is hydrating without being greasy, and the face wash is pretty basic, but I really like it so far. The serum leaves my skin with the best texture--super velvety. I haven't noticed any huge changes yet in my skin, but I've only been using the products for about a week. The bottles look like travel-size bottles, but it's actually a lot of product, since you need such a tiny amount of each thing to do the trick.  I'd say other than the moisturizer, they are full-sized products and will last a long time, so the price point is actually not bad at all. Before using this product I had tried everything I could think of to help heal and clear my skin.  I've used drugstore products up to trying Rodan and Fields.  All of which never gave me great results.  When I came across Tula I decided to try this travel kit and I must say I was truly amazed!  Within a week I started seeing results.  My face felt smoother and it quickly cleared my breakouts.  My redness from acne scarring has begun to lighten as well.  My skin has never felt better.  I would fully recommend this skin care line to anyone suffering from uneven skin tones, acne, and acne scarring.And if you are on a budget, like myself, and don't want to purchase full sizes, this travel kit can go a long way!!  So far each kit that I've bought has lasted about a month. Great sample kit--love all the products for my 75 yr old skin--enough moisture. What drew me to the product was the antioxidants & no damaging additives. great for travel I have loved these products!  I am 100% serious - I have tried nearly everything and never been impressed.  I am so happy I found something that I absolutely love and know is working for my skin.  I love the smell/non-smell.  I love how they feel on my face, I love the glow they give to my skin.  I still have a few acne breakouts but I think that is due to my nutrition.  I don't think you will be disappointed trying these products. bought this kit love it went back and bought the larger ones. Nice products. Face wash is awesome. Leaves my face clean and doesn't irritate my eyes. I know it's good when it washes clean from my washcloth and doesn't leave any residue or makeup behind. The other products are nice and non-fragrant, have to use them a while to see a difference. Overall, I recommend these products. I love the TULA skin care products. After using, your skin feels really soft, refreshed and more youthful in appearance. I do think this line is a good pick for anti-aging. I would buy the large sizes if I had the money in my budget to do so. I highly recommend TULA. Transformed my skin! I wanted to give this brand a try. I thought probiotic skin care? Sounds like a good idea and the color of the packaging is beautiful. My first night of using all four products left my skin soft and smooth and radiant. I receive more glow from this skin care line then I do from higher end sheet masks! Will repurchase and look forward to trying more products. Also, I use the day/night cream on my 11 year old son face and he actually liked it! Love it! I'm 30 years old and struggle with combination dry and oily skin which makes it difficult for me to find product that gives my skin the hydration it needs minus the oily look.  I've been hearing a lot of buzz recently about Tula so I decided to give the discovery set a try! I am happy to say that after a few days of using the product, I am hooked!  First of all, it smells amazing!  Fresh and not overwhelming.  I also love how it makes my skin glow.  I can't wait to see what my skin looks like in a month. Bought this kit from Tula.  It is a great product for me,  I have tried a number of products for many years and I am glad to see results after a short period of time, 24 hrs.  I have dry, mature skin with dark circles.  I take probiotics, exercise, drink water etc., nothing worked.  I prefer not to wear make up and just want a fresh look.  This line delivers that for me so I have already ordered more products because I am elated with the results! I've only used the products for 3 days but I am very pleased so far.  It is hard to find products for dry/mature skin that don't feel really greasy and heavy, but  I am finding these products to offer good hydration without the icky feel. I never write reviews, but this product is worth talking about. I started with the discovery kit and have since ordered other TULA products and was not disappointed! My skin is more balanced, smoother, softer, more plump where those fine lines are and glowing! The small sizes are also perfect for traveling so I will continue to order this kit. TULA is well worth the price, I promise you will love these products! I wanted to try Tula skincare without committing, so I started with this travel pack. This stuff is amazing!! I'm 33 with acne prone skin and this has not broken me out. My skin feels soft and it appears to be helping my breakouts. Would recommend! This product line is so amazing! I can't wait to purchase the entire line. The probiotic skin care is the best way to go! I will continue to purchase and gain the results. It's been a couple of weeks and I am already feeling a difference in my face. Thank you so much!! These products are great! I absolutely love them and I have seen such amazing results since I started using them! Totally worth it! Bought this as a gift based on my favorable results. A great way to try a really good skin care system. I purchased this discovery kit to try out the Tula line after hearing great reviews, I was hooked after the first few uses. I will be purchasing the full size products as well!!! Okay...these products are absolutely LIFE CHANGING. My skin has never looked and felt better. I saw results in only 3 days! <3 Thank you TULA :) This was a gift.  The recipient says that it is wonderful, so moisturizing.  It was a big hit and she plans to purchase it again. Love this stuff. It's the perfect combo of preventing wrinkles and keeping your skin fresh and breakout free. The products all last about a month in this pack but the eye cream lasts way longer. I've never really taken care of my skin until recently. I noticed my skin was really dull and I wanted to give it a little more life. I heard about TULA and decided to give it a shot with this kit. I only just started using it but I feel a difference already! My skin is brighter, clearer, and feels way smoother. I especially love the cleanser & day/night cream. I use a tiny bit of the cleanser and it takes off all my makeup. I love it!! I definitely recommend this for anyone considering TULA! I've been searching for something that doesn't make me breakout, that combats wrinkles, and that feels and smells amazing. This is it! This stuff is the BEST. I absolutely love this kit. There's a different product for every part of my routine, and each one feels magical on my skin. I wash up then use the night cream and eye cream before bed -- honestly I feel like I'm glowing when I wake up. Then I use the serum in the morning under my makeup. It keeps my face feeling fresh all day. The smell is lovely and not too powerful. Highly recommend. Great product. The cleanser leaves your skin soft and clean."
B007HNSBD6," Great product! I love this green tea antioxidant cleanser. I've being using it for 2 month and I see the results. Thanks! My skin is super fussy and this stuff not only cleanses, but also soothes. I like that you only need a little, since it lathers up well - so the bottle lasts a long time. Plus, the smell of it is heavenly. Definitely my favorite face wash. nice light smell. My face does feel clean after using it. I originally bought this from the doctors office where I had my facials/microdermabrasion  but they didn't carry it any longer.  I found it on line at amazon. This cleanser makes my face feel soft and clean.  I don't want to use any other cleanser. Best product for 40+ age group and makes my skin glow. Used in combination with mandelic acid cleanser. Excellent product. I have used for years. Glad to have found on Amazon. Much cheaper. I was using Dermalogica cleanser but switched to this after I received a sample through Birch Box. I love how smooth it makes my face and takes my makeup off very effectively as well as cleanses my face. Outstanding facial wash. Great Product! My skin is glowing !!! Very satisfied! Love this product Disclaimer: i got this product at a no cost to exchange my Unbiased reviewVivant Skin Care Green Tea Antioxidant Cleanser is a gentle face and body cleanser designed for all skin types to remove any impurities from the face and body without any irritation. It is formulated to...  from Vivant Skin Care, LLCFirst of all, I love Green tea products. it's good benefits to our health. I am a huge huge fan of green tea anything so I really wanted to try this product and I love it!  Smells great and doesn't dry out my skin. Absolutely love it! this is a very good for sensitive skin. i would highly recommend this to all my friends. This review might be a bit different from the rest, because I'm a guy, and who says guys shouldn't look good! :PI really don't care about my complexion that much, but as of late, I have noticed that my skin has changed a bit, it maybe because of the harsh summer sun, or it maybe just that I'm getting old. Whatever the reason, I thought I might try this product. I have a darker skin complexion. While the product does not change the skin pigment color, it makes you look really fresh! My wife noticed it even before I said anything about using the product, and that was only  my first use. The skin also looks a bit tighter, and there is a nice glow. The smell is good, and you only need to little but of the solution at a time. Great product. For all you guys, get this product, It works.I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased and honest review. I tried this face wash on the recommendation of one of your estheticians and love the product. It makes my face feel clean without drying it out and the texture is soft and creamy. And it has a hint of green Tea Scent into it which I really like.I have sensitive skin, rosacea and I think this product is very calming to my skin.I was having a lot of problems with my complexion after getting pregnant. Some of my face was super dry and others were broken out. This fixed EVERYTHING and it only take a TINY amount to wash your whole face. I've even used it on the baby -she has baby acne-- it's very gentle and cleared her face right up! I definitely recommend this Green tea Cleanser! ""I recieve this complimentary for my honest and unbiased review."" I use it more as a body cleanser because I have oily skin and tea tree oils are very helpful to maintain that oil level. I have used various products but tea tree oil works best for me. So, I stick to products that contain it. Use it on a small area to test it if its suitable for your body. I love it, its gentle and the bottle is sized reasonably so you don't get a tiny bottle with a few drops of product.Sample provided without any obligations. I received this skin cleanser complimentary to test and review. The first thing I noticed was the seal on the bottle is really tight I had to get it off with scissors which is a good thing as it is shipped! It comes in a plastic bag as well so you should receive it in good condition.The scent is a very pleasant tea tree/floral scent that isn't overpowering. I used the cleanser with my konjac sponge and noticed it does not foam a lot but it certainly does leave your face feeling clean. I noticed after that my face didn't feel dry at all which happens with a lot of cleansers I have tried. The bottle says it preserves the skins natural acid mantle, I assume that means it is not oily or drying.I really like this cleanser as I am allergic to a lot of fragrance in products and it makes me break out. This one I will try on my body I think it will be okay to use!My opinion is based on my own experience with this product. I hope this review helps you in your own buying decisions. It is great it leaves my face so soft and clean. All my acne cleared up!!! The texture is really nice and I love it! Would recommend! I was asked to review this product. this product was truly amazing. It worked so well with my skin and did not dry it out at all. thanks again ilovetoreview. amazing product I've been testing this Vivant Skin Care Green Tea Antioxidant Cleanser for weeks and my husband too so far were not disappointed at all, this product is a gentle face and body cleanser designed for all skin types to remove any impurities from the face and body without any irritation. It is formulated to dissolve dirt, oil and make-up while preserving the skin's natural acid mantle. A great choice for those with rosacea or after a cosmetic peel. It contains Green tea extract, Kiwi fruit extract, Honey extract, Grape seed extract with Vitamin C, Vitamin E and organic ingredients that gives you a smooth, soft and healthy looking skin and with a friendly scent that you will love.I received this for free in exchange of my review, and im still continuing using it at Day and Night for a better results. This is proven and tested by me great stuff. my spa recommends it. I love it. Its light and foamy - I don't like thick cleansers or milk cleaners that seem like cream. I love this face wash, I have rosacea and it has calmed my skin. Many cleansers strip your oils.. I have acne prone skin and wear makeup everyday.  I needed something that would clean the makeup off without drying out/stripping the oils.  I received a sample of this product and loved it!  I'm a fan of this product. I spend a lot of money on face washes and cleansers. This product has a great smell. It also leaves your face feeling fresh and clean. It is gentle to use daily. It makes my pores feel clean. It also makes my skin feel fresh. I also love the fact that it can be used on your body as well. It is a face and body wash combined. I am greatful I was able to try this product free to a review site because otherwise I might have missed out on a truly great poduct. It is not made with harsh chemicals so it's safe to use daily. I have slightly oily yet sensitive skin but this product does a great job of balancing it out for me. Gives a deep clean without leaving me dried out. Love the product. Gentle on sensitive skin. Have been using for years! Love it! This product did what it says it will. My skin is a bit oily and after washing with this, it removed the oil and left my face oil free without drying it out. It has a pleasant smell that isn't over powering. I can only speak to my experience with this product, everyone has a different chemical make-up and I can't say everyone will share the same experience. I will definitely consider future purchases of this product. I use this as a shaving cream and it keeps my complexion clean and my face shiny. Have used this for years. Great product. Expensive but worth it. I love this gel, and if the price scares you off - remember to look at cost per use.  Less than a dime size of a drop works lathers up great.  At this rate - it'll last a year! No idea how the other two reviews cam to the conclusions they did? First one, if your skin is THAT sensitive then youneed to look for other cleansers rather than over the counter. Review number two, really? Did yo unot know you were ordering a two ounce bottle when you cliked the buy button? Anyhoo, the produce is amazing. I have been using it for five years now and now have no acne. I alos use there BP cleanser once a week. I use to have bad acne and I do have rosacea, but Vivant is the only product that has produced any positve results. Used Vivant - over the period of a week my skin was smoother/softer to the touch. The scent is subtle and refreshing as well. Easy to apply - no fuss, and just a dab will do. Struggled to find a facewash I liked, stoked on the Green Tea Vivant. Would love to see them branch out into other scents as well. Would recommend. Gentle. Both my teen girls and I love it! So far I really like this product. It smells great and leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed. It's a very substantial amount for what you pay. I will follow up with another review after I use this product for a few more weeks. I have been using this cleanser for about 7-8 years.  LOVE IT.  Also bought the Vivant Buffing Grains to use ocassional also, which I also love. Great product! Very mild didnt irritate my sensitive skin. would recommend This is my favorite cleanser! Smells great and doesn't dry out my skin. Absolutely the BEST!"
B01N7G1YGD," Distinctive and eye-catching and the bottle has lovely aesthetics.  Natural goodness of its organic essential oils and retinol. Oh darlings if you never try you will never know right I have very sensitive skin I react every time with a new product but this oil is a true miracle I woke up every morning with baby skin so let's all shine Love it.  Makes your skin glow.  Feels great at night.  Skin becomes so soft. I'm not sure what I love more, the packaging or the product. I love everything from the smell, to how it works, to how it makes my skin feel. Most nights, I don't even need an additional moisturizer. I love this product. It makes my skin look great. Also, because I have a nut allergy I am so glad that this is nut free. I will buy this again. I work full time, and I don't get as much sleep and exercise as a I should and that makes my face looks haggard and too old from my age, so I searched for a product that can help me eliminate it, and I found this. Since I started using it, It instantly calms and smooths my skin and I see results overnight in my fine lines and wrinkles. I really love the scent on this. It is mild and fresh. Its is an oil and I have been applying it on my face. Since I have dry skin It feels great and my skin has been looking more nourished. Very happy with this purchase. I love this oil- plain and simple. It’s a dupe for a really expensive oil with almost the same ingredient make up. I have used both oils and I have to say I like this one better and so does my wallet.This oil is a beautiful green color with an amazing spa like scent that is very calming to me.I use this oil sparingly as my last step at night and I wake up to gorgeous skin. My skin is bright and glowing. I can even use this under my eyes with zero irritation. I use this even when I’m using my Differin.It makes your skin so soft and youthful. It really impressed me. I will definitely be a user for life.I can’t wait until I see the long term benefits of this oil. I definitely will update.Thanks for the beautiful product that I bought with my own money. I started using Sunday Riley products and loved them! This product is similar to the Luna oil. I alternate these due to the price. THis is my favorite Geneva Naturals product. Personally i LOVE the smell of it. Its very calming and great at night after the shower. I am a big fan of this night oil. Much cheaper than the Sunday Riley version. It has an advanced effect to my skin that visibly lessens lines and wrinkles, while correcting damage by the sun, time and exposure. And it does all this while you sleep, as it is an oil you want to use only at night. I'm completely in love with this product. It's not only been highly effective for acne prevention and anti-aging, it melts into my skin and feels amazing. For some reason I just like this product. It's like my skin want's it and I don't know why. Argan oil makes me break out but this one does't. Would buy it again and again. Makes my face so soft and it smells amazing!,, I bought this as a more economical substitute for Sunday Riley Luna sleeping oil. It works just as well! The retinol is gentle on my sensitive skin. Feels great on my skin although I have oily skin.. Wake up to a nice soft face in the morning. My holy grail product for glowing skin.  Whether you are a novice beauty/skin care enthusiast or well versed at what's currently trending this product really made my decision that I will stick to this I'd pass on this one -- I found a cheaper products out there that do the same thing (nothing) as this one.Earth therapy products are all the best and number one in my list!!"
B01N4G95LP," NICE Best face wash i have ever used and i have EXTREMELY sensitive skin. I have used this product for many years and have never had any issues with the product or the packaging. Rich, creamy lather - and yet easy to completely rinse off.  No scent (that I could detect).  Left my face feeling fresh, clean. I have been having trouble with my skin the last couple months. I was using another facial cleanser that did not help and switched to this. My skin cleared up within the first week of using this product. I would highly recommend this for anyone that has combination skin! I love this face wash. I have used many expensive face washes in the past with very little luck. This is by far my favorite face wash I have ever used. It is awesome for sensitive skin. It effectively gets rid of the oil on my face without over drying. I will continue to buy for many years to come."
B06XQXS7XC," Where do I even start. I have tried a few facial masks this year trying to hunt down the right one. This jar specifically is my 2nd jar, my MIL got me my first one as gift for Christmas. I use it once a week and this is the best one I have tried. It goes on nice and smooth and as thick as you want it to be. It smells good and is refreshing. My skin is noticeably brighter and clearer the first week of use. It feels great on my face as well. There is no residual oil left behind, my face is clean, clear, and renewed. The directions say to wash your face before applying the mask. I did not for the first pic because I wanted to see for myself just how well it works. The first pic was the first time I used it ever (about 6 months ago). The second pic was from last week when I was taking a comparison pic to show the difference it has been for me. I sent the side by side pic to my MIL who was inquiring and she was really impressed. This is a lifer to my beauty collection, I feel like it has really made a difference in my skin. I really love this brand's eye cream so I figured I would try this brand for my face mask. I am happy with the results as it has made my skin feel smoother and brighter.  Even more amazing is that while I was using the item, I noticed that the back of the box alludes to the product having a positive effect on skin spots.  Since I have a round red spot on my upper chest, I figured I'd apply some on there as well. I noticed a slight difference so continue to apply and now my spot has nearly entirely disappeared.  I have included a picture because it's actually quite interesting and I could not be more pleased. I love this clay facial mask!  It smells amazing like refreshing, cool cucumbers.  It is also very moisturizing surprisingly.  It isn't the type of clay mask that dries and turns rock hard on your skin making your skin feel uncomfortable,  This mask is purifying and moisturizing so it is great for dry skin.  It stays soft so it is easy to wash off.  After rinsing off, my skin immediately feels smooth and soft to the touch and very clean.  My pores seem smaller. My redness is calmed down.  This picture is after about 2-3 weeks of use.  It has brightened my skin tone and evened it out.  Can't wait to see how my skin looks with even longer use. I love how this mask goes on smoothly, hardens quickly on my face, and leaves my face super smooth. I have pretty sensitive skin, and I had no problems using this particular facial product. I love this mask, I use it every Sunday as part of my weekly routine and it tightens and brightens my skin. It shrinks my pores and is great for pimples or blackheads. Sometimes between my weekly use I'll use it just on my chin where I break out. It smells really nice and the tub is huge, I feel like it will last a really long time.I suggested the mask to my little brother who has been dealing with acne for years, and after one use he saw results. He started using it 2x a week as it suggests on the jar and within two weeks his acne was looking a lot better, less red, and less blackheads. Honestly the best it had looked in years. This stuff is awesome! The smell is refreshing without being overbearing and the mask itself is cool, gives you the feeling you are at the spa. All that is missing are some cucumbers for your eyes. After taking the mask off, I noticed my skin was less red and puffy. Working mom of a toddler so I definitely need all the help I can get! Sunday is mama's funday.  I stake out the bathroom for a lazy bath, treat my hair with something goopy, take the scales off of my heels, and give myself a facial.  I love facial masks....nothing you can do but wait till they're dry!  My problem comes when I try to take them off, though.  Somehow I get facial ick in my hair, it's hard to remove the mask completely, it's just a bad end to a perfect half-hour.  Pure Biology, however, has created a lovely, clean (and clean-smelling) clay masque that I thoroughly enjoy.  It has an extremely fine texture, no scent, and dries to a thin film on the face.  And what was really nice was....it washed off easily and completely!  My skin is highly sensitive, but it had a great experience with this mask.  I'm using it twice a week, and loving the results! I have never used a clay mask before and wasn't sure what to expect. I did my first application last night. It felt cool and went on smoothly. The smell is very pleasant. It reminds me of cucumber but my husband said it had a ""clean earthy"" smell. A couple of minutes after applying my face started tingling. It wasn't really all that pleasant but after a couple of minutes I didn't notice it any more. It was easy to remove and my face was a little red immediately after removal but that went away quickly. After drying my face it felt very smooth. This morning I worked out at the gym and just with rinsing off my face it still felt as smooth as it had last night. I'm going to use this a while to see if my face color evens out and will add to my review in few weeks. I'm really falling in love with the whole Pure Biology line. It works so well! This clay face mask comes in a decent size container for the quality product it is. It dries in a reasonable amount of time, then you scrub it off with a wash cloth. I've used it a handful of times, and my skin feels happier. I'm using it in conjunction with some of the other Pure Biology products, and I will just say - they work really well together.The clay mask works great on my sensitive skin - like the other Pure Biology products, which I love. Too often I cannot use products because they are too harsh or rough on my skin. Not the case here :) When I first opened this container, I immediately smelled the fragrance.  It was a clean almost citrusy scent.  It wouldn't be something I would seek out but it smells nice and It would be more perfect for a body lotion.  I decided to go through with using it as it was my intention to find a new product.  The texture was smooth.  It almost was like a thick lotion so it really made a good face mask.  It did spread on very nice and even as well.  After some time,  the scent wasn't so overwhelming, almost like I wasn't wearing it.  It washed off nicely.  It was refreshing.  My daughter says she's next to try it. I feel like I have the my skin back from before I had kids and was a young care free 22 year old. Even though I have extremely sensitive skin, my cousin recommended I try this to balance my skin tone and reduce my pore size. Make no mistake, this is not a relaxing kind of mask. This mask does the work of 10 of those, but you pay for it by being uncomfortable during the time you have it on. You will love the immediate benefits of the mask (tight skin, rosy glow)...so go for it!! I love it so much that I use it once a week and will update this with the long term benefits in a couple of months :) Wonderful clay face mask by Pure Biology. I have only have the chance to use it for a short period of time but in a few days I've noticed soon redness fade away. This face mask has a wonderful smell that reminds me of cucumber and fresh air. The best part about the mask is that it doesn't leave an oil type residue on hands or face. You definitely get a great amont and a little surely goes a long way. I prefer 100 percent natural products but sometimes I had to step outside of that to get the look and help I need. I appreciate the fact that it is cruelty free and is a non GMO product. I’m a sucker for a good mask so after falling in love with numerous other products by pure biology I thought no harm in trying this one and so glad I did!  My skin has been acting crazy this winter , after having my kids, getting older , who knows the reason but I can tell you I adore this! It goes on smooth and creamy (like any quality face mask should) and afterwards I was so happy. Any signs of blemishes and breakouts have disappeared , I have soft smooth skin, less oil and such a glow. My mother in law even ordered one for her after trying it. It’s definitely my new favorite ! When applying to my face it felt amost like it was working right away package says to leave on 10 to 15 min i left on for 10 minutes. I absolutely love this i felt like i was at a spa right from home. I washed it off with cold then warm water my face felt smooth and i feel like it made my pores smaller.  Will definitely ise as often as i can love the product especially if it will make me feel younger. I had to try this mask because I need something to help fade both my red acne marks and dark spots from older acne, and  skin has been feeling a little rough and dry. Ive noticed my dark spots are lighter now that I've been using it. A lot of the redness is gone from my acne and my complexion is finally more even-- something I've struggled with for years. Each time I use it my face feels much softer instead of stripped and dry.  An extra bonus is I've noticed my pores on my nose are smaller--hallelujah! I'm a complete sucker for anything that makes my skin feel plump and hydrated and this one does it all! I like the consistency of the product which makes it easy to apply, a little bit goes a long way. Smell earthy but is not strong in fact, it's so subtle that if you're sensitive to smell you can tolerate it. I love the feeling when I apply it to my face, it makes it super soft and feels healthy and tight. My skin didn't have a negative reaction to it so that's a plus as it is rather sensitive. This brand is a great buy for the amount of product you get. This mask is easy to apply and has really help clean out pores. Even my son that is a teenager and breakouts on face bad has been using and he is happy to have his face clearing up! Great product will keep buying and recommend it to all! i am always afraid to try new things on my face, but i needed something different than what i was using because i have started to randomly break out for no reason.  This clay mask made my skin red and i could feel a tightness when it was on, but once i rinsed it off completely, the redness did not take long to go away.  My skin felt lighter, not sure how to explain it, but it felt almost heavy before I used this mask.  It seems to have cleared out my pores somewhat which may be that feeling of lighter.  I overall liked it and will use it again. I received the mask a few days ago, and decided to use it last night (since today is my Birthday and I went out). After rinsing, my face felt tingly (in a good way), and it felt refreshed. I am extremely picky when it comes to what I put on my face, but I have so far been very pleased with what my face looks like today and how great I feel. I am hoping that wit using it once or twice a week it will help clear some break outs!*My friend also used the mask last night with me, and LOVED it. A+ mask, to start is has a very nice smell and soft smooth texture.  A little goes a long way so the 9oz jar will last me a while, great value!  Very easy to apply, cool soothing feel when putting it on and washes off with minimal rubbing with cloth.  I've used it 6 times now and almost immediately I had a huge improvement in the oiliness of my forehead, which is usually really bad, and the redness in my cheeks!  I'm really loving this stuff, really looking forward to continued results! I try to treat myself to a clay mask twice a week - weekends and Wednesdays. I recently ran out of my Arbonne mask and thought I’d give this a try since the reviews were good and it cost significantly less. I was not disappointed. The mask has a light scent and feels cool to touch. I use it along with cleanser, toner, and moisturizer to keep my pores small and my skin bright during all seasons, but especially during these cold upper Midwest winters! I really like the Pure Biology product line! I have tried several of their products, from shampoo to this clay face mask, and I've never been disappointed with the quality of their products. This mask has a light, pleasant scent. It doesn't irritate my skin and leaves my face soft, smooth and looking dewy. I feel that my makeup goes on more smoothly after using this mask. I really like the way my skin looks after using this clay face mask! I love the feeling I get after using this mask.  I have very open pores so I have to use a mask weekly to maintain them.  So far this mask has made my skin look a little more porless (if that is a word).  My skin is much smoother and I have not had a breakout yet.  I have been using this for a short time, so I will be providing updates as needed, but as of now this works well.  I have sensitive skin and have not had a irritation. Adding another Purebiology to my beauty collection. I'm amazed on how much product you get in this jar. This product does have a floral smell but not too over powering. I tested the product on my hand first to see if there's any allergic reactions. Again, these products haven't given me any problems with my sensitive skin. It takes about 10 minutes to dry and washes off fairly easily. It left my skin smooth and refreshed. LOVE. I am a huge fan of facemasks. I have tried so many and have spent more money than I care to admit on skin care products. I love using the product because it does not irritate my skin nor does it cause excessive dryness. I usually do this mask 2 times a week, with a coconut oil mask in between. The two masks combined have helped tame my mild acne and help cut out the redness around my nose and cheeks. I have a big collection of face masks and am happy to have this as a new addition. I love using this product for my personal spa days, I’ve used it a couple of times so far and it leaves my skin softer and smoother. Definitely gets the dirt off my face . The fact that it’s vegetable based and non GMO makes me feel better that I’m not putting chemicals on my face. I would rebuy this item and would reccomend . Product was delivered on time I like to use a clay mask 1-2 times a week to detox my face and this just might be my favorite clay mask I’ve ever used! It goes on so smooth (I can never get the homemade mask smooth 🙄) and smells so spa like. It comes off easy with warm water and then my face is so soft. I like to use at night after kids go to bed and after washing my face and meditate while it’s on to take the self care up a notch, then after the mask I put my night serum on my face then PureBiology eye cream. Toxins be gone!  I purchased this to do a deep cleansing mask to help with the immense amount of stress & deep cleaning my face needed the past few weeks.  I simply brushed it on, sat in the tub to soak for 30 minutes and then rinsed it off.  My face was smooth and soft and the top layer of dead stuff sloughed right off!  I will definitely incorporate this into my weekly routine! I purchased the Vitamin C serum first then seen they also had Clay Mask so I wanted to try it since I loved the serum- So I have had  it about 2 weeks now and I love it too. When I used it the first time it tingled my upper lip for about 2 seconds but no where else, when I used it again no tingling, I love the feel of my skin after I take it off. Will definitely purchase again. I personally lobe how easy this product is to wash off. Makes my skin feel a lot softer and less oily and dry. I have also noticed a reduction in blackheads and breakouts. Product is also easy to apply. My other mask just ran out so I was looking for a new one and this was what I ended up choosing. I have heard great things about probiology in the past, and really wanted to give them a try and I finally pulled the trigger. I tried this out for the first time last night and it felt amazing! My skin felt so soft afterwards, but it didn't feel like it took anything good out of my skin while taking the bad. I really really like this mask, and it will be my go to from now on. It left my face so soft, I just want to keep touching my cheeks! I like this brand a lot and this mask from PB is no exception. WOW, what a large amount for the price compared to a lot of the other similar masks I buy. I feel like I always get a great value from PB. The scent is nice and not too much while its on your face and the mask itself dries quick and rinses off easily. My skin felt soft and clear and exfoliated after. Came completely sealed and full. People keep saying it burns so it must be allergy related for them. Go get allergy tested and stop leaving bad reviews for perfectly good products! I only felt a slight need to itch my face just like I do if there's food on my face or when wearing unfamiliar makeup. I look forward to see what it does to my black heads long term. Pure Biology Clay Mask is a wonderful product I'd been using it for almost 3 week's and I notice my face was a lot cleaner & fresher, and ofcouse the more time using the product better results. I do have acne but it doesn't make my skin dry or breakout more. I have a healthy face with a little acne that's life. Amazing pure biology product's like always. From my wife: This clay face mask smells wonderful, like cucumbers.  It's thick and easy to apply.  Once on your face, it tingles but does not burn.  It's refreshing for the 10 minutes you wear it and it washes off easily.  I use it roughly two times a week and have had great results.  It's help clear my pores and it is actually noticeable by others. I love my new face mask!! As soon as I put it on I could feel it going to work. A nice tingling sensation, and a wonderful smell. It washes off easily and I noticed my face felt smooth and my little blackheads I get around my nose were gone!! My face has a glow after using, like it took a few years off.... I need to use more than once a week lol!! This really does a nice job at cleaning your pores, and so easy to use.  This is a clay face mask that you apply to your freshly washed face, cover your face and allow to dry about 15 mintues,  Simply wipe off with warm water.  You skin will feel like you just had a great fresh skin.  Very soft and renewed.  Very pleased witht the results. I used this face mask as soon I got it, and found it to be very beneficial to the look of my skin in just two uses.  it smells great almost like a cucumber and has a soothing effect on me.  my skin will just get better the more I use it, but also it doesn't irritate my skin, as I don't have sensitive skin.  I liked this product very much. I have used this twice since I got it. So far I really like it. The fragrance didn’t bother me at all. It tingled a little when I first put it on. But that was probably because I never use anything on my face. I am looking forward to seeing the results after more time has passed. I have bought many other products from pure biology and I have yet to be disappointed. I'm always looking for quality clay skin masks because of how it's supposed to help your skin. And now I finally found it. You get a nice big jar, and don't need to use a lot because the consistency is just right. It's easy to remove and doesn't leave a chalky residue feeling on your face and leaves no stubborn streaks to remove. Nice consistancy and a pleasantly fresh scent. Reminds me of a spa! A little covered my whole face, so I'll have this jar for a while. I saw a lessening of the redness from my acne spots, and the large pores on the apples of my cheeks were noticably smaller. My skins was bright and refreshed. I'll be adding this to my rotation of skin masks. This is my 2nd time to apply the clay mask. Its really hard for me to find something like this that doesnt burn and helps with my break outs and oily skin. Once applied the first time i had tingling in the areas of my breakouts. This time ot was even less tingling in those areas. Real easy to apply and take off. It smells AMAZING and it left my face feeling soft and clean. Highly recommended. I have sensitive skin and have had trouble in the past using masks.  But this one is great. It felt great on and did not irritate my skin,  it left my skin super soft and smooth.  My face did not feel dry after use. Ive definitly added this to my regular skin care regimen. Love this mask! It smells super fresh, but not overwhelming. The consistency is great, and easy to spread over your skin. I had a mask brush, but my teen daughter used her fingers just fine. It had a slight tingle for me, but not for either of my daughters. Note, I'm 37 weeks pregnant, so my skin is kind of out of wack right now. The mask left our faces feeling super clean and fresh. Not a lot of moisture or anything added, but more of a crisp feeling with no residue left over. I am a believer in the Pure Biology brand, as I currently use several of their products. This one I decided to try because I have had dry spots and blackheads re-occuring especially around my nose and eyes. I LOVE this because it's not dry and hard, but soft on the skin. Absolutely love the smell too! A+ I’ve purchased Pure Biology products in the past andbthey never disappoint.  Love this mask!  Smells very pleasant, almost cucumber scent, but light.  Drys well and tightly on the face yet seems to draw moisture to surface so after rinsing off my skin is glowing.  At 63 years young I am very pleased! I've been using this once a week for the past month and I have noticed a big improvement on my face, I haven't had any issues with it drying it out or redness only soft clean clear skin. I was alittle nervous reading some of the reviews since I have sensitive skin but I have a bunch of awesome products from pure biology and wanted to give it a shot. It worked great for me. No burning or redness. My face felt so soft and fresh afterwards!  Another great product from this company!! I absolutely love this clay mask! It dries smooth and when you wash it off your face feels so smooth and soft! I had a few pimples and it pulled them up and dried them out and made them easy to remove! I used to us a clay mask from clinique but I think this one is going to replace it! I love all of the pure biology products but I especially love the clay mask. I have sensitive skin, which isn’t affected or irritated by this mask. And my pores and blackheads looked smaller within a week of use. I can’t wait to continue using this product for even better results. I LOVE this mask. When I put it on I sAw results straight away. I’m always looking for products to get rid of my massive blackheads. I think with some religious twice week work, this product with certainly do the job! My face felt soft, not tight and hydrated when I washed it off. I love this sooooo much!!!! This is a great face mask. I LOVE face masks, they are my favorite thing to do when I am stressed out, so I am kind of picky. This tingles when you put it on, which I love, because I know it is working. My skin feels cleaner after I use it. It also works awesome as a spot treatment. what is there to say oh yeah this stuff is rather good... it works wonders for my skin and makes me feel refreshed.. It works a lot better than i expected and keeps me going thru out the day.. it is not heavy like other face mask and is the only one I have not been allergic to. I have several Pure Biology products so thought I would try this mask. I Love how this makes my skin feel.  It really gets rid of some of the winter blah and dead skin. I've always had problems with blackheads and this really helps loosen and remove those. I would buy again. This face mask makes my skin so soft! I'm using it in conjunction with the other Pure Biology products and have loved them all! Leaves my skin hydrated and super silky. I've been using the products together for about a month and can tell such a big difference around my eyes. Bought with total eye cream. I love how this makes my face feel so soft and clean. I have large pores and I noticed them diminishing which is amazing to me. The scent is refreshing and the container is huge so this will last a long time. Definitely love purebiology products. I love facial masks that let you know they’re working. You can feel your skin tighten slightly as this mask dries. Once removed, my skin was noticeably smoother, felt refreshingly clean and looked great. I have sensitive skin and this left no redness or tenderness anywhere. Product is smooth and refreshing to apply, works as promised and expected.  Nice packaging - it looks OK sitting on my counter.  If I put it away, I forget to use it!  Generous size jar, will last a long time.  Love to combine this with their eye cream - nice pampering!  Maybe a face cream with sunscreen will be next for them?? I’ve used this mask several times already and I love how clean my skin feels after using it. I also like how firm my skin feels after washing off the mask, and it’s like I feel my pores shrinking after each use. I have tried other Pure Biology products and none of them disappoint. I have been on a Pure Biology kick and have been trying out quite a number of their products.  (So far, I have loved all of their products!)  The clay mask is refreshing and makes my skin feel very soft and clean.  My pores are smaller and my skin seems less oily.  This has been a great product for me! Loving Pure Biology!  Tried the shampoo (great!) and just tried the mask...! Does a great job of cleaning your face and leaves it feeling refreshed and tight.  I have just discovered Puee Biology and life it based on the products I have bought so far.  Plan to try more! I was a bit skeptical reading other  reviews, I used it last Friday as soon as I received it and love it, left my skin so soft and smooth, but I wanted to used it one more time before typing a review .  No burning, no redness, just beautifully soft skin.I recommend this mask ! My face feels incredibly smooth after using this clay face mask. I have sensitive skin that is acne-prone and sometimes dry with flaking and I felt a slight tingle but no irritation. I'm very pleased with the results and my skin feels wonderful and not tight and dry. Nice clay mask. Doesn’t have a strong scent. It does take a little work to get it all off if you leave it in too long. My skin feels smooth after using. WONDERFUL. i read about some other mask that “clay” was a great way to detox your skin. I used this and my face was SOOOOOO smooth after. It was noticeably brighter (per my fiancé. If he noticed them it works). I use it 1-2 times a week when i need a perk up. I got this mask because I had tried another product from the company.  The clay feels light, cold and amazing.  It spread evenly and had a mild tingle. 10 minutes later, it easily rinsed off and my skin feels and looks great. This is better than any clay mask I've ever used :) I was so excited to receive Pure Biology Face mask! I've tried many face mask and have never found any that I like, But I'm absolutely in love with this face mask! I've noticed a huge difference in one use, my skin is so smooth! My pores look smaller and my skin tone is even! It reduced the redness ! I cant wait to continue to use this product! I used less makeup after using it also ! You get a lot so it should last you awhile! you only need to use a little bit. It applies nice and wipes off easy. It smells good but it isn't over powering! I recommend this product to everyone. I promise you'll fall in love with it just like I did! I literally just finished using this product. I love It! The smell is cucumber. Fresh and relaxing. I really can feel this work after just one time. my skin feels tighter and smooth. I followed up with the night cream.. Really like these products. you can't go wrong for the price either! Another awesome product for pure biology. I have extremely sensitive skin and all of these products are soothing and moisturizing without any burning sensation. This mask smells amazing and my skin feels so soft afterwards. A great product line to pamper your self. Used the mask for the first time last night since I had some free time while cleaning, I applied it after a quick face wash and left it on for about 15- 20 minutes before washing it off. For a clay mask its pretty easy to wash off which is something I was weary of when I first purchased it because a lot of clay masks just take forever to get off. After I applied toner and honestly forgot to apply moisturizer which is usually bad news for my skin. What was great is that when I woke up my skin actually felt moisturized and I didn't see any signs of irritation or blemishes from using the mask. Great product and for the price, the size of the jar is a great deal. I have very sensitive and dry skin and nothing weird can touch my face or I break out. but this works great for my skin. I cleanse my face with warm water and let the steam from my bath soak in to my pores then put this on, leave for 10-15 mins until hardened and dry and wash off gently with clean wash clohlth. my skin looks and feels great after using once a week! Love this mask. I will admit I have only bought cheap dollar store masks before. I am working on upgrading my beauty routine and so glad i found this line. This mask smells so good I almost want to eat it lol. But besides that, this mask made my face feel as smooth as my two-year-olds face. I love it. Highly recommend it. Can't wait to buy more items from this manufacturer. I bought this product for the great reviews. I received it and started using it, the first day i used it, it left my face feeling so clean. I used as directed and my face has not broken out in pimples so that means it's really getting down to the pores. I will be purchasing this again. I've tried clay masks in the past and they never really made my face feel clean. I decided to try this one due to the excellent reviews, and I'm so happy I did. A little goes a long way and it spreads nice and evenly. It has a pleasant scent, which is a nice surprise. It left my skin feeling refreshed and very clean and it evened out my skin tone nicely. I'll be buying this again once this jar is finished. I got this the other day and me, my kids and my stepmom all tried and and had phenomenal results. After a couple minutes it starts to tingle and I love it! After washing it off, my face was softer than ever! The tub is big enough to get many many uses out of!! I have used this mask twice now and so far I have had no issues with using it. It has a clean earthy scent to it. It's a nice smooth textured mask. I apply my masks with a brush and I can apply it nicely. I put mine on a little thicker and it still dries nicely and washes off easily. Leaves my skin with such a nice smooth finish. I am a mua by profession so high quality skin care is a priority and somthing I know quite a bit about. This is an amazing quality mask! I feel supwr clean after using aND love the gentle way it exfoliates leaving brighter skin immediately . Perfect for sensitive skin! I have tried other clay masks and they were hard to get off, and that only agitated my face. So I decided to try this one since it seemed different. I love the scent and how it feels going on your face. It's easy to wash off and leaves my face feeling soft. This mask is so refreshing! I really like that my teenage daughter and me(I'm in my 40's) can both use it! It makes my face feel so clean and fresh. It is helping with her blemishes and at the same time doesn't dry my skin out! I love Pure Biology products! I am 12 weeks pregnant and My normally clear skin has been horrible since week 2-3.  I am conscious of what I use on my skin always but especially when pregnant and this company seems clean. I am pleased with the results of my first use and will continue to use this weekly. Bonus: it’s a huge bottle that will probably last 6 months+ I really liked Pure Biology Clay Mask.This is a very nice clay mask. My skin feels incredibly soft and smooth. After applying it i waited for it to dry and then washed it off with my fingers.. My skin feels great,my pores are not clogged I only needed to apply a small amount of mask,a little goes a long way. I love how this Pure Biology face mask smells. It smells just like cucumbers to me. It leaves your face feel refreshed, smooth, and fresh. Just apply to your clean face and wait about 15 minutes and wash it off. Your face will look bright and refreshed. I have other Pure Biology products, so I figured I'd try out this mask. I absolutely love it! It has a cooling, refreshing smell that makes me feel more awake. I use it about once a week in the shower, and it's amazing. My skin comes out feeling soft and smooth as ever. I would recommend this product and brand for anyone looking to improve their skin care routine. So with all the hype on the reviews I could not wait to get this mask and try it. I’ve been looking for something to help refresh my pores. So far I received this Monday, that same night I used the mask and have used it twice this week so far and my face feels so refreshed and soft... I can’t wait to order more You will begin to love this mask as soon as you open the container because it smells great.  I know that is not the biggest concern when you are getting a facial mask, but no one likes to wait while a mask dries when it smells awful and your eyes are watering.  A watched mask, never hardens.  This mask left my skin feeling hydrated and clean. It went on smoothly without bumps or clumps and came off just as easily.  A great mask to add to your skin care regime. I'm a huge fan of pure biology products and this mask certainly didn't disappoint! It feels cool and refreshing going on, rinses off easily and leaves my skin feeling amazing afterwards! I'm excited to continue using it as part of my skincare routine! This clay mask is great. Comes in a awesome package. I've used it a few times and it leaves my skin soft and smooth. None greasy formula.  I've tried other brands but this is better than other brands I've tried. It smells like cucumbers and I like that. I purchased several things from Pure Biology and have been using them together for about a week (clay mask, eye cream and night cream). My skin feels amazing and looks brighter. I have some dry spots that seem to be clearing up as well. Great products! This mask is great! It goes on smooth without burning. When it dries it isn't too itchy either.  I usually have to take a mask off before its totally dry  because it itches so bad.  My skin felt really clean,  fresh,  and glowey afterwards! It was really nice! I am loving this mask! It is so smooth and silky right out of the container that I keep rubbing it on even after my face is coated. And where other clay mask I have gotten have had some harsh smells, this has a more subtle light smell I just love. It makes me so relaxed. Lol. And the results, awesome! I am now a fan girl. :) This mask has surprisingly fresh, light scent. It went on easily and didn't get cakey as it dried. Easy to rinse off and my skin immediately felt smoother. After 2 weeks, I've seen a great improvement, excited to keep using. Definitely recommend. This is a wonderful product!! I have used several different clay masks before but this one makes my skin feel like silk! It has a very pleasant smell and isn't sticky or greasy. Very easy to apply and rinse off as well. It isn't gritty yet it gets the impurities out of your face. I highly recommend this clay mask from Pure Biology. This product was much larger than I anticipated so it’s a great value. It smells really nice but not too overpowering. I have super sensitive skin that tends to be oily in some spots and dry in others. This mask really helped even out my skin tone more. When I put on makeup the next day it went on smoother and easier. My pores look smaller as well. This is an amazing mask at an amazing price. It has the same texture as most clay masks I've used. It has a slight tingling feeling letting you know it's working. There was a noticeable difference in the size of my pores around my nose area. I have oily skin so thats a big concern. The mask is easy to wash away. It left my skin soft and smooth with no tightness that comes with most clay masks. I love the way this makes my skin feel. The first time I used it, I could almost instantly feel it tighten my skin. I feel like it has helped even my skin tone as well. My skin feels more moisturized since starting this line of products. I have bought a few face prodycts from this company so I decided to try this mask out. I think this mask is very effective I have used it twice this week . It made my skin tones seem more even and soft . Exactly what I was looking for ! Luxurious face mask! This mask feels so creamy on my skin, not drying like other masks. I have rosacea and sensitive skin and used this with no problems. My face felt so soft afterwards and pores appeared minimized. Very happy with the products I’ve ordered from Pure Biology. This Clay Mask is truly amazing!! I began using it a couple days ago and I am beyond impressed. I never thought I would find a facial mask that would help reduce the appearance of my pores and dark spots that tend to linger the more I age. It also smells amazing and the texture isn't sticky like others I've tried. In just 20-30 minutes after applying, my face feels so refreshed like I've just left the spa. I highly recommend this Clay Mask to everyone! My face feels so much cleaner after using this product. I love how it tightens my fave, grabs all the dirt and impurities, and leaves me with a fresher feeling. I’ve been trying to stick with more of a skincare routine to help with my adult breakouts and this is my favorite part of my skin care routine! I've been needing a clay mask for blackheads that won't dry out my skin. This mask fits the bill. It hink its fue to having some glycerin in it. It smells like cucumbers, and there is a cooking effect.. I used a silicone mask brush to apply. I ordered this after trying the night cream and the eye cream and I'm just as happy with this as I was the others. My first clay mask, but I felt very clean and soft after removing the mask. I now use it twice a week, as recommended. Works great, easy application. Mask went on easily, when I removed it washed away great,  left my face feeling clean no leftover residue like most do.  I have noticed a difference in my face, been using for awhile now.  Works great! This clay mask has bentonite clay and I heard good things about this natural ingredient so I wanted to try it. After using the mask, my face felt clean and illuminated. Mask itself smells good so I will be using this now once a week. I am in love with this mask! The packaging was pretty and super easy to read. It smells wonderful and my husband even said my face was glowing. I am super happy with the quantity you get for the price. I will definitely buy this product again. The summer is over and it shows on my face. This mask gently clearing sun spots from my face without a irritation. I only used 4 times:1 week so far so if I use about 3 more weeks it'll be great. This mask is gentle enough so I can use it more often. Smells great & dries fast. Leaves my skin with feeling clean but not red. Some products are too harsh on my sensitive skin & this is not. My skin feels smooth after I use. I like that it dries quickly because I don’t like waiting I can't get enough of this skin care line. Pure Biology is top-quality product and I know that I am really treating my skin when I use it. I love using this mask on my face every week or two, revealing super soft and smooth skin. I am soooo happy with this face mask...it makes my skin soooo soft...it seems to be evening out my skin tone and my face looks great for days after using it...I have been using it twice weekly and my skin is noticeably improved! This is a great face mask, it leaves my face feeling soft and clean and rejuvenated. I've ordered quite a few of these pure biology products and they have all been really amazing and I will continue to use them! Love this stuff! I love trying new products and this one did not disappoint.  Goes on very smooth.  Easy to wash off.  Makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.  I do have sensitive skin and this hasn't bothered my skin at all.  Definitely a winner. The container was bigger than I imagined it would be, which is always a plus.  I've already used this a few times and I love how cool and smooth it is when it goes on. My skin has bee super dry and it made my skin really soft afterwards. Very pleased. I found this clay mask to be extremely moisturizing.  Clay masks usually dry out my skin, so that was a nice surprise.  I put it on my neck too.  The smell is mildly floral and very pleasant.  PB products are great in general. I love this line of products. I began with the night cream and now have all but the eye cream. They apply so nicely and do their job. No weird smells, no clumps, professional packaging. These are awesome and half the price of Obagi. Definitely comparable though! I think this is my favorite Pure Biology product thus far. I look forward to pampering nights with a hot bath, candles, and this face mask. The mask goes on smooth and it smells amazing! My skin feels so soft after use and y skin looks so healthy. I love using clay masks on my face and am always trying new ones. This one is amazing and makes my skin feel so soft!! Definitely recommend. This face mask is amazing!

Highly recommend! Love the way my face feels after a mask! You can feel it working it magic. Face was smooth and clean feeling. I have used many types of mask, this one removes pretty easily no scrubbing needed. No residual feel after removal. Will definitely keep this one in my beauty routine! This is a very smooth mask. It is white in color, no real fragrance. Upon drying onmy face it washed off easilyand left by face smooth. Non Gritty in nature and not as thick as most  mask are. One jar should last several months.Recommend Wow, this product is really effective.  My skin is pretty sensitive so I have to watch what I apply on it but this stuff worked really well, didn't irritate my skin and it was the smoothest it has ever been after using it. I just started using this product line and I love it! The mask smells great and is easy to use! It had a little tingle when i first applied it, but no burning or rash marks, just great looking skin when I was done! I'm excited to continue using it and see even more results! I am a sucker for masks. When I saw that this was a clay based product, I knew I had to have it. I’m so glad I tried this. It brings out the little imperfections in your skin, and then the next day, poof! They’re gone! It’s like an at home facial...seriously....get this and pamper yourself. I absolutely love this mask!  Like my other Pure Biology products, I love it.  My skin feels amazing, I can tell a huge difference since I have started using these products and I could not be happier with the results.  I highly recommend this mask!! First thing I noticed when I opened the jar was the calming smell. It smells so refreshing! when I put it on my skin I felt a cooling effect. My skin didn't feel tight after using like alot of other masks, it felt so soft. I have used this product for a few weeks and it is cool and refreshing.  Our home is heated with the cold winter and so we have dry air.  My skin had been drying out too and this is keeping it hydrated and looking calm. I was so excited the day I got this! I haven't found a mask yet that wasnt clumpy or didn't dry out my skin. Immediately upon using I felt a huge difference in my skin. Its softer and I can see my pores look cleaner! Great clay face mask.  My skin feels deep clean and so smooth after I use it.  I have combination skin and it really works for the dry and oily parts.  Kind of tingles when you first put it on.  I love the way it feels. This is my favorite of all the masks I have used. It goes on nice and smooth and doesn’t smell bad at all. My face is so soft and smooth after I use it. My complexion is smoother and my pores are less noticeable. I love the texture of this mask.  It spread easily and covered beautifully.  I quickly felt it start to dry and my face begin to tighten.  I will definitely keep using this as part of my New Year’s beauty routine.  Treat yourself. Another pure biology product for my wife. She seems to like this line of products. She says her face feels refreshing and clean and notices smoother skin after just a week of use. She said she will be getting more. I love that this mask is thicker than what I’m used to. Using this twice a week I’ve seriously noticed improvement in my skin texture. It is well worth the price, I’d even actually pay more for this. Thank you! I love mask. I am 41 and know the importance of skincare. When I find something that makes my skin feel great and has a good formula I stick with it. The price is worth it and along with a face serum it’s a perfect set. This product leaves skin feeling tightened and smooth.  My favorite thing about this mask is the delightful smell. It smells like cucumber. Light, crisp and clean.  That’s exactly how your skin will feel after using this mask!

I have always suffered from acne and since I began using my face is clearing up. It feels very refreshing when I wash. It is easy to put on and I love my face looks so much better. My face feels so smooth after using this! It's very smooth to put on and doesn't take forever to keep on your face before taking it off. It seems to have a tightening effect as well, in a good way that is. I like this mask alot. Its smooth and easy to apply. I could feel it getting tingly, which, to me meant it was working. Its easy to remove and left my face so smooth aftwards. It even shrunk my large pores on my nose area. I'm fast becoming a fan of all the Pure Biology products! I got this in and immediately tried it today!! I love it! It smells awesome, and feels even better! It smoothed my skin and it feels super clean. I think I’ll be addicited to this! It’s also a large jar-not a tiny one! LOVE these products! The Pure Biology products I have bought so far have not disappointed one bit! This face mask feels very cool going on and washes off very easily. Leaves my face feeling smoother than ever! Before I even opened the container I could smell the cucumber. This mask goes on so easy! Its not thin like other masks i have tried. It goes on smooth and comes off smooth. Leaves my face feeling refreshed and ready. This is the best clay mask I have ever tried! It leaves my skin feeling so clean. When I started going to the gym I noticed my face started breaking out more. After using this clay mask I have noticed that my acne and black heads have cleared up tremendously! It also has made my face less oily which I've been trying to do for years. No other product that I have tried works as good as this one! I love masks, and this is the best one yet! Going to buy another to give as a gift. This clay face mask works great.

It feels really nice right away when you apply it.  A little goes a long way. Can't wait to use it again. I used it with the vitamin C toner. I HAve tried other brand mask before. This one is the only one I have seen amazing results. My skin feels refreshed. My pores are no longer clogged and seem to be shrinking.  Definitely will buy again. I like how this mask makes my skin feel after use. My skin feels soft to the touch and very mositurized, I have also noticed that it has helped diminish the size of my pores - they seem to be alot smaller around my nose - a plus for sure. The smell is amazing, I love how my skin feels even the day after.  It has a great consistency, but I do recommend using a brush to save product and make it easier to apply.  I discovered this brand by accident and can't get enough, I just got the eye and face cream! I love it . It work's so great. My face is tighter , smoother and just feels so much better. I have purchased several of the pure biology products. They all work great ! I highly recommend this product ! Leaves my skin feeling smooth with a healthy glow. I have combination skin and this works well to remove excess oil without drying my skin. Will definitely be getting more when this tub is finished I love this mask.  I have super sensitive skin and this mask is so gentle on my skin.  I love that it dries quickly and is easy to remove.  It leaves my skin feeling soft and does not irritate it at all. I absolutely loved this face mask! I've been searching for an effective mask and was so happy to have this one. The texture is so soft and it smells so good (a little citrusy or maybe cucumber). It left my skin soft and oil free- which is a big thing because I have very oily skin. I recommend this to anyone and everyone. i was worried i wouldn't like this mask as much as the last face mask i was using, but it's really nice! it smells great, it makes my skin feel clean and smooth, and there's healthy nutrients in it I love pure biologys products and never been disappointed! This mask is phenomenal, my face feels softer and hydrated right away! I can’t recommend this product and other pure biology enough! I Used this as soon as it came in, because my skin has been in need of some TLC. It smells like a spa. To me anyways. Cool and refreshing, like cucumber and aloe. It went on smooth and easy. It burned a little at first, but that went into a cool refreshing tingle. It wiped off easily, and my skin is SUPER soft now and it pulled a couple of blemishes to the surface so they can be dealt with. I look forward to using this regularly in my routine. I don't have blemishes, knock on wood, but my face does tend to get oily. This product makes my face feel super clean and oil free. No more oil shine. Definitely a re order item. I love it!!! This is a great mask! The container was larger than I was expecting, and it has a nice consistency. I have only used once so far, but it left my face feeling so nice and it was a great price! This Pure Biology face mask is so refreshing, when you open the jar is smells so good you almost want to taste it.  Really thick, it only takes a tiny bit to cover my whole face, and when it dries it washed off very easy, no skin peeling.  This is a great skin care line. I have really sensitive skin so I was a bit concerned,  but I used this several times now no issues. It does seem to take a bit of time to dry but it’s better then most clay masks I’ve used. I have been using Pure Biology products for about a month now (various ones ) and I just love them! My newest I've tried is this mask and I love it! It doesn't dry super stiff like some masks and my face feels so clean and smooth after. Such a great product line! My skin feels amazing after using this clay face mask! I can't get over how soft it has left my skin, and the decrease in the large pores I typically get on and around my nose. Def a fave of mine! The clay is soft and goes on skin smoothly. I use it at night as my mask to cleanse my face. I leave it on for about 10 minutes and it's very easy to wash off. It has a good smell as well. I really like how this mask doesn't dry your face out like other clay mask I have tried in the past. It leaves your face feeling deep cleaned, easy to apply and is exactly what I was looking for! Have been using this item for a few days now and am very happy with the results! I wanted to remove my blackheads and my face became more clear and the difference is really shown. Very happy with this purchase! I totally love this clay mask! I've used it every day since receiving it! The mask is easy to use and leave my skin feeling and smelling so good 😊 I'm recommending this item to my friends! I got this product to go with a couple others I got for my truck driver boss. He wants to lose the old skin and bring out the young. So far he's seem really good results. Good product. Ladies this is a must for a spa night with your girlfriends. Your skin will feel so fresh and rejuvenated after this mask Is washed off you will be counting down til the next ladies spa night! This mask makes my skin feel so so good. I have very dry skin and yet after I take the mask off my skin is so soft. And it smells so fresh which really surprised me. I left it on about 15 minutes. It was easy to put on and take off. You can tell when it's time to take it off because your skin will feel tight and the mask changes colors. I'm very happy with my purchase. This smells amazing!  I feel like I've just left the spa!

I read the reviews and decided to give it a try. I am 46 years old have large pores on my nose and upper check bones.  This mask tightened my pores so well that I have been telling people I work with that they should check it out.  Love it for its results and for the price.  I also bought the night cream and I love it too!!! When I turned about 17 1/2 I swear I went through a second puberty or something. Among other things, I started getting a lot of acne. For a year I have struggled with this until I got this mask to make my pores smaller. My skin is actually clear for the first time in forever!! And just in time for a really fancy date I’m going on!

I would definitely recommend this to people who are going through the same thing. Thanks pure biology😘 This mask feels awesome.  It smells like cucumber, which is so much nicer than other masks I have tried.  It dries quickly without being uncomfortable. It comes off easily, and my skin felt so good after! This is by far one of the best clay masks I have tried! It has a wonderful smell. I was amazed at how soft my face was after the first use. Most masks like this bother me during the drying process but not this one. It firms up but does not harden like most so it does not leave you with that uncomfortable feeling. I definitely recommend this mask!! I purchased this with the night cream. My daughters and I have been using and love the face mask. It is working miracles on the large pores on my 12-year old after only 2 applies. I also love the way it makes my face feel after each apply. This is a great mask for all ages and a must have!

It has this mild tingling effect to it and if you have sunburn our dry skin, it'll be a cool burn effect lol This mask is amazing! My skin was soo smooth after trying it. My skin feels tighter and smoother after using this. Smells really good and didn't have to use very much to cover my entire face. Great product! The Pure Biology line is wonderful, and this clay mask is no exception. It rivals one I used to get from Sephora that cost over 3 times as much. Feels good, smells good, and I see results after using this. Great product, the first thirty seconds had a very intense cooling sensation so I wouldn't recommend for very sensitive skin. Besides that it really cleared up my skin and my pores looked visibly smaller and clear. This is also really good as an overnight spot treatment on stubbirn pimples. I have drier skin and it didn't leave my face feeling tight. Overall I really like this product and plan to use it weekly. I previously bought the Aztec Clay you see all over Amazon, but have been loving some other PB products so gave this a shot. Same results but my face isn't fire engine red the hour or two after using it, like AC. I am loving this mask! It leaves my face feeling so soft after using it!

I use it twice a week and it lasts for months! I am so in love with this mask. I've been using for about 6 months, I've bought 4 jars (although I use more often than it suggests because I love it so much). Completely cleared my skin up from acne and dark spots. My skin is clear, feels fuller, I get so many comments from people. Since it is a clay mask and can be drying, I use along with a hydrating mask or just a good moisturizer. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a good clay mask. I decided to try this after other reviews showing how it helped the redness on their faces. I have only used it twice and my redness is already getting better!!! Plus it’s smells really good This mask is magic. Very effective. Will snow try the creme as well. Burns a bit when you apply but becomes better after a couple of minutes. Wow! There is SO MUCH PRODUCT in this container and a little goes a long way. This thing will probably last me a year with regular use. The mask feels cool and refreshing. I don't feel dried out after and it instantly smoothed my skin. The smell is fresh and great and its got the classic green/white/gray look for all your silly face masked snapchats. LOVE! I love this face mask! I have never used any type of mask on my face, Its nice because applying the product on my face feels nice and smells wonderful. It leaves your skin really soft and refreshes.

This is a really effective mask for cleaning your pores and diminishing any dark spots on your face! My skin definitely is noticeably brighter and looks a lot fresher! It also smells really strongly of cucumbers (which makes me want to use it more and more.) I like using it in the morning but either AM or PM application should be fine. I highly recommend this mask and will be trying other products from their line. I had never tried this brand before and decided to give it a try.  My face feels so clean and soft after using the mask.  I will definitely buy this again.  I also bought some of their other skin care products and really like them all.

B073X4GYRV," I really like this face wash.  It has tea tree and I like the way it smells.  It’s not too harsh on my skin and it helps with my breakouts.  I’ll buy it again. This is a great product. Very cleansing and refreshing. Has a great scent as well. The face wash feels relaxing and satisfying. It lathers well and smells good. It doesn't leave skin feeling oily, makes my face feel fresh and clean. Good for my sensitive skin. My skin tends to be oily during the warm months. But like others, does not make my skin feel tight or irritated. Smells nice, cleans and rinsed well. I love how gentle it is. Reminds me of cetaphil in a sense. It’s not meant to remove a bunch of make up. But definitely works great for me in the morning as I start my day! This facial cleanser does a really good job cleaning my face!  I have big pores and, because of that, I have quite a few blackheads on my nose.  I have noticed that the blackheads have been completely cleaned out! Love this! The grapefruit seed definitely helps with eczema or any candida related acne. Before this I was taking antibiotics for skin. Love the way this makes my face feel.  So fresh and clean.  I love this product! Excellent product.  Provided proper PH balance for my skin.  Left my face bright and tight after each wash.  I will buy this product again. Tea Tree Oil is amazing for so many things!It's incredible for the skin to help with inflammation,  bacteria, acne, and debri.The ingredients combined within this bottle do a good job for my 16 year old sons skin. It's not harsh but I wouldn't use it daily. I'd suggest no more than every other day at the most.It is a thick, creme like lotion that spreads on smoothly and rinses easily and completely. He's very pleased with the results he sees. Another great product from Era Organics. I've been buying a lot of their stuff and so far i like everything. I have oily skin so their products doesn't make my face become overly oily. This product is up to par with delivering the same quality and performance for my skin. I don't get rashes, breakouts, and my skin doesn't become even oilier. I love tea tree oil and any product with tea tree oil in it. This prodcut is amazing. I had a rash on my upper arms and legs and with two uses it cleared it right up and I don't itch anyone. It feels nice and cool and smells so nice when you use it in the shower. The scent Is soothing and calming and washes your entire day away leaving you feeling relaxed. I would definitely keep using and buying. I have struggled with acne since I was about 15, I'm now 23 and it's safe to say I've tried just about everything. My acne was a combination of cystic and just plain old hormonal as well. I think the reason this works so well is because it truly is an all natural product. While other washes and moisturizers have ingredients you can't even pronounce this line has natural ingredients that you not only have heard of but can easily be researched as well without running into brick walls.I wish I would have taken a before and after picture to show the results not only has it cleared up my acne but I believe it has helped fade my scars as well!  And I love the smell! This is a great cleanser. You only need a tiny amount and it lathers and cleans your face. It's not harsh and leaves your skin feeling so soft.The customer service this company has is terrific. Fast and very friendly. I will buy from this company again! Trying to use more organic products.  This cleanser works very well and leaves the skin feeling wonderful.  Have been very pleased with the results so far. Smells good, my skin feels great, and I would definitely recommend this! The cleanser is creamy and you can smell the tea tree oil. It does not leave your skin dry. You get antibacterial and antifungal properties to help fight your acne. I love it because it's gluten-free. I am a huge fan of tea tree oil based products.  This one does the job - all natural I’ve tried multiple products and my acne just kept getting worse, but I found the best products for my acne and is making a big difference in my life. I am 35 years old and I was fighting with Acne for 7 years and nothing was working until the day that I started using this amazing product in conjunction with the cream. Gentle. Lathers well so you don’t need to use allot. Bought a second one because my teenager stole mine. This is truly the best stuff Great Product!  Super quick shipping! Really like this cleanser. Does not dry out my skin. My blemishes seem to be less frequent. I plan to purchase again. Made my face feel very clean and soft. I love this cleanser! It smells and feels nice on my acne- prone skin ☺🤗 Amazing product tea tree oil has long been a favorite of mine, for all kinds of uses (mixing a few drops into vapo-rub makes a phenomenal treatment for toenails), and it's cooling, so I bought this tea tree oil face wash. it's an ""a little goes a long way"" product! all I need is a nickel-sized drop and I'm good to go. I've used it with a gentle-exfoliation mitt and with a sonic scrubber. it would be good if using fingers, alone, though.this wash is very creamy. I like to leave it on for a couple of minutes, for the tingle. my face feels fantastic after washing. ""fresh"" would be another apt description. I always thought of tea tree oil as being something for acne, but it's been wonderful on my skin, which would be extremely dry were it not for the high humidity (which doesn't make my skin oily, just extremely moist). so it seems this would be a good face wash for any skin type.I used to think these washes were way too expensive for my budget, but because it takes so little to do the job, the bottles last a long time, making them not very expensive, at all. I'll still sometimes do a quick scrub with baking soda and/or coffee grounds, but now I use a face wash regularly. it's good to mix them up (in my experience), but this tea tree oil wash will most definitely be in my rotation, now. I love era organics products, in general, and have many for both myself and the cats (their anti-itch and diaper rash creams work wonders on pets' summer skin problems). Product works great to help with acne! Excellent quality. I received my order on a timely manner, its as i expected or better. It is definitely up to par. Great face wash! Really clears the skin up. I have acne under my skin. So it just looks irritated but this cleanser definitely helps. This stuff is pretty amazing. I have been struggling with spontaneous oozing blemishes on my face since August and literally nothing the dermatologist gave me (including antibiotics - topical and oral, sulfa-based face washes and lotions, acne topicals, etc) made any real difference. After months of frustration I did some of my own research and came across information regarding demodex and tea tree products. I tend to lean toward natural products anyway, so I purchased this and started using it twice daily to wash my face. The blemishes have gone from 2-3 new ones appearing weekly and persisting, to now maybe once a month and they are smaller and go away quickly. This wash also seems to help balance my skin in general - I usually have a very oily t-zone and dry cheeks. It did not magically cure my skin, but it is making a noticeable difference. I never have dryness or adverse reactions when I use it, and it seems to be lasting. I am just getting ready to re-order and have been using it faithfully for about 2 months now. Definitely worth a try if you are struggling with skin problems and don't want to pile chemicals onto your face. So well done. Clean, nonstripping, and healing. The size is so generous...well worth the money. I am so thrilled Era has a new cleanser and hope to see more for skin concerns. This is gentle enough for ANYONE to use and better than any acne system I've ever had. Well done Era: another masterpiece. I have used Proactive from many years. I wanted to try a natural face wash. My skin is very sensitive and I breakout easily so I was a little nervous. I started using it last week twice a day, Along with Era Organics face cream. I did break out as I knew I would, but it stopped and my skin started to clear. So far my skin looks great. The redness on my nose is fading and my skin fells smooth. I am definitely going to keep using. I have all oily and bad dry skin..a mix of both. It's always been a terrible inconvenience, but this has changed everything for me! Instantly I noticed a difference to smoother skin..less oil..less flakes.. then over time after a couple of moths, I have no oil or dryness after using it. Im at the point now where if I forgot to wash my face for a day, I can just rub this around on my face for 20 seconds, wash it off, and I'm good as new again. It's helped so much! It's really cleared up my skin too. This is a very effective face wash!  I have always had a hard time finding a face wash that washed the oils away without severely drying out.  I have one extreme or the other, and this ash helps a ton!  The essential oils in it are great for skin care.  If you haven't smelled tea tree oil before, the scent may throw you off a bit but it is low key and it grows on you! I love the smell of it for sure. Gentle Cleanser. I recently tried out a new face cream and it made me break out like a teenager so I purchased this in hopes that it could help me clear up. The Cleanser has a nice refreshing smell and it gently cleans my face without over-drying. I noticed that my pimples are starting to dry up which means I won't have to cancel our family photos.Two Thumbs Up! Finally! I have been searching for such a long time for a face wash that doesn’t irritate my skin and gets rid of acne at the same time. As someone that suffers from minor adult acne this is a godsend! The smell is a little off putting but combined with the face lotion this is a great duo! Highly recommend. Great for acne or breakout prone skin. The smell of this cleanser is mild and not too over drying. Great with the Era Organics tea tree oil moisturizer, also. I felt like the cleanser was gentle but helped clear up small breakouts from clogged pores This face/body cleanser is creamy, smooth going on, and leaves a fresh but soft feeling afterward.  I noticed within two days that the mild rosacea in my cheeks diminished after 7 days it is so minimal that I had to use a magnifying glass to see if I still had it, I don’t!  It has a nice smell and you don’t need much to use.  I have had a couple of skin issues over the last couple of years and E raOrganics helps me cure or fight them. Thank you! This stuff is literally my holy grail. I get more of the hormonal cyst acne on my chin which if you suffer from cysts you know they are sooooo hard to deal with. This stuff will take the swelling down the very next day. If I can resist picking at them (lol) and just wash with this twice a day then it’ll be completely gone in 2-3 days which is a god send. I’ve only gone through about 1/4 of the bottle and I’ve had it for I think 4 months now. A little goes a LONG way. And it has a silky, smooth consistency and a clean tea tree like sent. I love this stuff so much! Absolutely love this product! It has really helped clear up my rosacea! My rosacea typically consists of bright red scaling skin. I have used this for a week and it has calmed my rosacea down significantly. It is really gentle on my skin! Love ERA Organics products and this is no exception!  I do not have oily skin nor blemish problems but I do love tea tree oil and this wash leaves my skin so soft and fresh feeling!  It only takes a tiny pea sized amount so this bottle will last quite awhile !!  Excellent product.  Looking forward to the other new products coming out !!! This cleanser smells pleasant.  It feels creamy.  I only use a tiny bit of cleanser to wash my face so the bottle seems huge.  It seems natural and s hood value. Cleans face without drying it out, smells great Well, this is magic. My skin loves it. I use a small amount morning & night and my skin cleared up, it's glowing & hydrated, its soft and healthy. Yes its on the pricier side, but you can make it last a while.Love this company- customer service is the best !!!! I actually use less and less make up because my skin glows and i feel like i need less ! ❤️ thank you EraOrganics for this awesome-ness !!! I have been looking for a good face wash for sometime and have tried many different kinds looking for a organic product that works for oily skin. This is working great! My skin feels good and not greasy at all. Would recommend and will buy again. Excellent! There is plenty of tea tree oil in this cleanser, as you can smell it mixed in with other pleasant aroma's. The salicylic acid gently removes dead skin cells. You only need to use a tiny amount and apply it to your damp face. I leave it on for about a minute after smoothing it around, so that it can soften the dead skin cells clinging onto my face. After that, the dead skin cells rinse off easily (I have dry patches mixed with reddened areas due to rosacea). There has been a distinct improvement in the condition of my skin since using this. It has some scent at first but pleasant. You don't need much and love the texture. Use many of Era Organic products for quite awhile and rate them all 5 stars. Ingredients are organic and natural. I like this face wash but I have to mention that it has an unusual consistency, it's a little slimy. I have soft water so on my face it feels even more so. But I feel like it's covering my face in a protective layer and doesn't strip my skin like most face washes. Yet i feel like it cleans my skin, even cleans off my makeup, everything except my eye makeup cause I don't really use it around there. Overall Love this product!!! My daughter is an athlete and struggles with acne.This has made a huge difference in clearing her skin. This is a great cleanser.  I get oily skin and this takes care of the oiliness.  It doesn't leave your skin dry like other cleansers I've used though.  Afterwards your skins feels fresh and hydrated.  A little goes a long ways too. Once you add water it expands and goes over your whole face. This is the best face wash I have ever tried.  The aloe vera makes it silky soft and feels great on my skin. It cleanses very well and leave my skin refreshed. Another great product! Tighten pores, doesnt over dry. Whole family is using my bottle, have to buy more...lol Smells AMAZING and it is made with natural ingredients.  No weird burning sensations, just a clean feel. This face wash is great. It is creamy, but in a good way. It also removes all of my makeup at night, unlike most natural cleansers! I have hormonal acne along my jawline, and this has helped to clear that up. Love this.  Has cleared and smoothed my face.  It is helping my teen son as well! This is branded as a Face/Body Wash. I'm using it as a Face Wash and I LOVE it.It is a very nice size bottle for the price considering it contains many Organic ingredients. This was the selling point for me as I've been trying to move towards chemical-free/organic personal products.It's velvety smooth and creamy and makes my face feel soothed, smooth and clean after I use it. In my opinion, it's really improved my red blotchiness and small patches of eczema.I will say, if you do NOT like the smell of Tea Tree Oil, you MAY not like this product. However, combined with the other ingredients, I think the scent is more subtle than in other Tea Tree Oil products I've tried. Because of this, I feel the scent is quite pleasant actually!Really Loving This! Silky, soothing and smells very nice. My skin felt wonderful after using this cleanser. love it, cleans well, great for sensitive skin,cleans deep I'm always a little scared to try new products since I'm allergic to so much stuff.  I've tried a couple of products from this company so far without any issues, so I thought I would try this face wash out too.  I love it!!  My skin is so soft after using it and just feels wonderful!!  I don't have any reactions to it either!!  This is the best face cleanser I have ever used, it's amazing!! I wanted to use this for a while before leaving a review so I have been for a few weeks already.I have rosacea and there is really no product that helps me with the readness , the only hope I have is to find products that don't cause flaring . So I didn't really have hopes for this face wash either but I am so excited that it actually makes a difference. Not a huge one but I can see it when I'm not using it compared to when I do use it and I'm so thanfull. I love all era organics products that I tried so far but this one is my favorite. I've been using this for about a week now and so far it seems to work great with my Rosacea. My skin hasn't been breaking out as much and the redness has calmed down a lot! I wish I had before and after pics but unfortunately I do not. I recommend all Era organics to anyone I know with skin issues. I even told my doctor so he could start suggesting it instead of prescribing meds. Such a clean feel! I love this brand.  I already use the cream  my this company.  The cleanser feels gentle and refreshing.  It smells good, too. LOVE ITI use this one when I'm breaking out more. doesn't cause irritation. my bf has sensitive skin and this doesn't irritate his face which is wonderful!! I use Tea Tree Oil Cleanser & Body Wash on my face, neck and chest.  I have been using it for a couple of weeks and feel my skin is smoother and less red. I also feel it is fading the two dark spots on my face.  I like the clean smell and natural ingredients. I use this every day with Era Organics moisturizer too and I love it! It's gentle on the skin and the only time I break out now is when I forget to use it! Love this face wash.  Makes my extremely oily skin feel nice and smooth without drying it out. I bought this and the vitamin C face cream together. I have been using these on my face for he past few weeks and I love them! My face truly feels so clean after using this face wash. It also has a good smell! I basically can only use era organics face wash. Any other face wash. No acne, no redness, no issues! This also removes my makeup too. Love it. I've been a loyal Era Organics customer for a while and they never disappoint! I have combination skin and this leaves my face clean, fresh, and brighter. Also, you don't need a lot of product. A little goes a long way. Very pleased :) This stuff works great for my 9 year old I normally use the natural face wash and I have been for a little over a year now. But I've always felt with acne, my face has improved dramatically since using these products, so when this face wash came out I had to give it a try. Again another awesome product. I use this for when I have breakouts. But I still use the natural one for everyday. I was very excited to try this cleanser as I have had such a wonderful experience with the other Era Organics products.  I do have oily skin, and I do occasionally use tea tree oil, so this seemed like a great choice for me.  I find the scent very refreshing.  This leaves my skin with that same smooth soft feeling as did the Cleanse and Restore, but also seems to be more refreshing for my skin type. I can't wait for the tea tree moisturizer!  All I can say is my skin is happy. Another winner in an already amazing lineup! :) This bottle is fantastic! Never met a product I didn't like from Era Organics.  Purchased this for my daughter to try. She has dry and oily patches on her face and suffers occasional  breakouts.  This seems to be helping so far, and at the very least, her dry patches are not aggravated and her oil seems to be less.  :)  That's more than previous products have delivered, and I love that it is all natural.Customer service with this company is also always top notch.  =) I am excited to have a new face wash!  It smells very good and makes my skin feel very clean. Purchased this face wash for my Aunt as a gift set I put together (with the Tea Tree Face Cream) and she loves it!  She definitely has oiler skin-- and though she has got her acne under control - it is only with great diligence of using quality products like these she has been able to do so! (and will continue with these items purchased!) Very nice face wash! Improves the skins look! I've been using this face cleanser for a couple of weeks now. I love it! It is thick and creamy, and makes my skin feel soft and clean. I have very fair skin, so also have trouble with redness and rosacea. This cleanser has reduced this somewhat, and helps my skin feel a little less ""angry."" I love that the formulation is sulfate and paraben free, organic, and contains great ingredients like tea tree oil, aloe vera, and pomegranate seed oil.  I only use it as a facial cleanser, although it would be a great body wash, too.  I have used several different products from Era Organics and have loved every one of them! I really like the ERA Organics line of products. They leave my skin clean, refreshed, and hydrated.  My daughter gets acne on her back and I been using it on her and to wash my face.  Tea tree oil is good at reducing and healing acne. Smells nice too.  Does not dry out your skin. My teenage daughter has just recently began to breakout.  I wanted to get her something organic for her face.  I don't like to use lots of chemicals and struggled finding a good organic face cleanser for acne breakouts.  She also has sensitive skin which makes finding facial products challenging. ERA is a perfect fit!  A little goes a long way.  It has a light scent of tea tree, but it is not overwhelming.  She uses it at night and says her face feels refreshed. It has helped her breakouts tremendously.  It is a large bottle and the cleanser is pretty thick.  The bottle should probably last about 4-5 months (totally not kidding). She messages it on her face for about 30 seconds and then uses a ERA gentle moisturizer.  Love these ERA organic products!! With it being summer (increased perspiration) and with me being pregnant (hello crazy hormones) I've been breaking out a bit more than usual, especially on my body. I have a few other products from Era Organics and I love the care they take in choosing their products ingredients, so deciding to give this cleanser a whirl was a no brainer for me. What I also found unique to this cleanser is that it's dry skin friendly, I live in Colorado and with our altitude and lack of humidity it can be a real battle to keep my skin well hydrated. This cleanser smells so amazing (basically like straight up tea tree, so if you don't like the smell of tea tree this is prob not a cleanser you'd want to try), the smell actually lured my husband into trying it for himself too haha! We both love how soft and clean our skin feels post cleansing and a little bit goes a long way (which is good because we're now sharing the bottle). I am in love with Era Organics products.  And this exceeds my expectations.  I have had red blotchy skin for the past 20 years.  I have tried so many different lines from department stores, infomercials and QVC.  I have tried the oil cleansing method and my own DIY cold creams, too.  With that said, I kind of have given up on having consistently nice skin.  So when I bought this, I looked up  every ingredient on the EWG site, and found all the ingredients are toxin free. I thought, well, I can't hurt to try it. After only one week, my skin looks and feels so much better.  I only use it at night, and only need about the size of a dime, or smaller. (The amount in my picture is way  too much) I don't need moisturizer anymore either.  In the morning I just wash my face with water and go.  Thank you Era Organics.  I'm looking forward to trying out all of your products. I love this cleanser. I have been using it for about a week and it does help decreass the redness. It leaves my face feeling clean and soft. Usually I either get a clean and tight/drying experience or a soft and oily experience. This gives the best of both worlds. I love the natural ingredients, especially the tea tree. The smell is nice and you only need a small amount to wash your face. It should last for a while. I bought Era Organics tea tree face cream & this cleanser. They work so well together! I love using an organic line & I’m very happy with the results! Im sitting here almost in tears.. I recieved this lastnight i bought it thinking it just going to be a fail lile all the other stuff i have bought in the past. I have really bad redness and inflammation on my checks that has got so bad over the last year. I used this stuff lastnight woke up and its 70% gone! And the redness that is still there is so light. I highly recommend this stuff. It also makes my face sooo smooth and the smell is decent This is a great face wash. I bought it for my teenage daughter. She doesn't really have a problem with breakouts but doesn't do a great job of washing the makeup off her face at night. She has been using it about a week now and already she is getting into a better habit of keeping her face clean, especially at night. You only need a small amount for proper coverage, lather, and rinse. It leaves skin feeling soft and clean (not greasy). It smells nice, but not an overpowering smell. We definitely recommend. Tea Tree Oil is one of my favorite things.  I've been using in on my scalp for a long time but never thought about how beneficial it would be for my face.  I love the fragrance when I'm using it!  It's great that it is a gentle cleaner - I don't feel dried out like I do when I use so many other acne washes.  My face feels fresh and the skin feels and looks healthy!  The price is very reasonable considering how much you get and how little you have to use for an effective wash.  It's so great - keep it up! I just received this and I like it!  It has a natural tea tree essential oil smell.  I have used it twice and it leaves my skin feeling very smooth.  I am excited to continue using this.  It doesn't ""bubble"" like soap.  It is a very smooth texture that feels very soothing to my skin.  I always use moisturizer after washing my face, but when I use this face wash my skin is so smooth, I wonder if I even need it.  Thanks for a great product. I purchased a tea tree oil bar soap for my sister over a year ago and she loved it but when I went to buy it again, the company discontinued it and I have since been on the hunt for a replacement for her favorite cleanser.  Era Organics has done it! My sister absolutely loves this tea tree oil face cleanser and actually likes it better than the bar soap she previously loved.  The natural tea tree oil is great for those with stubborn acne like my teenage sister has.  She has used it for a week and her face is noticeably smoother and clearer.  It has a nice creamy consistency and a little bit goes a long way when it comes to this wash.  She primarily uses it on her face but I tried a little bit out as a body wash and it was a really nice moisturizing experience (and it smelled great too!).  I will be buying another one for me and will continue to get my sister some! Thank you for finally allowing me to stop my search for the perfect face wash for her...I found it in your product! Very nourishing face wash. Smells like Tea Tree which has a variety of cleansing properties. Helps with overall redness and cleanliness of the skin. Easy to dispense lid. Fits great in the shower to lather up and cleanse. Era Organics makes wonderful products and this one is great for face and body. I am a swimmer, and every summer I seem to contract patches of ringworm that plague me all summer long. While I bought this product for the patchy redness on my cheeks, and as an overall gentle, healthy cleanser on my old-people skin, ha ha.... I decided to try the tea tree on my itchy patches. This really helped soothe the pain and itching, which of course helped me from spreading it. Felt so much better, I ordered the cream as well! This face wash is great so far.  The only complaint that someone might have is that the tea tree oil scent is really strong.  Which, is most likely because it's tea tree oil.  I like that this is cruelty free and it's all natural.  I think it's important to follow the directions on it too.  They say to wash your face in a circular motion for 30 seconds.  The cleanser is kind of thick and slippery, so if you don't take the time to rub it in to your face (in gentle, circular motions) it's just going to come straight off without thoroughly cleaning your face.  Overall, I think it's a great product and I like the way my face feels afterwards! This is a great product, I have tried a few products from this company and been very happy with them all. The tea tree scent is mild. It's a smooth and thick consistency. A little goes a long way, so the bottle should last quite awhile. I've noticed a difference in the amount of blackheads I have, as well as an overall decrease in the oiliness of my skin. For some of us skin regimes are something that we take very seriously. I don't add a product to the line-up unless it really brings something to the party. There are plenty of tea-tree based cleansers, the thing is that though some of them have a strong tea-tree scent they don't have much in the way of the actual essential oil. This one does,, and you can tell by how clean your skin feels. Made with only natural and organic, food-grade ingredients, and without chemicals, toxins, paraben, perfume, or SLS I am not worried about the ingredients. Plus it's cruelty free and made in the USA. I have a new obsession with Tea Tree Oil and this is now my new favorite face and body wash. I mainly use it just for my face and chest and once in a while if I get a breakout on my back from the summer heat. After the first time I washed my face the tiny white dots I had on the tip of my nose are gone. I have oily skin with dry patches and this makes my skin smoother. I know the smell of tea tree oil could bother some people (not me) but once you rinse it off the smell is gone. This is a huge bottle and a little goes a long way! Although it looks like a pearly soap, it actually feels more like a lotion cleanser when I put it on. It feels fantastic and I love the light scent! My husband used it as a body wash and said it works great. It's organic, which is important for my family. I'm lazy and don't like to use a separate makeup remover and then wash my face. This is a great facial cleanser that does both! It is gentle, but cleans well. I never feel like my skin is left dry. I used to be really oily but after my kids I'm more normal. This cleanser truly is great for all skin types! I just used this stuff and it's so silky smooth. I love the smell because it's not over powering and you actually get a lot of product. The product goes a long way. I always open my bottles to see how full they are as well and it was filled to the neck so they don't really jip you. It really just smells like a light tea tree oil. So far this is working great for my nightly routine. I love that it is gentle yet effective. The directions warn to try a small area on your to check for an allergic reaction. Great advice and I'm loving the results so far. My face feels fresh and clean after a gentle wash. I have been having some summer breakout issues happening and my regular cream cleanser hasn't been cutting it. I love that this face wash is still creamy enough to be gentle and not overly drying.... but the great ingredients help with some of the oily breakouts I have been having. It has a fairly strong tea tree smell (not surprising given the name of this product) which I love (the smell doesn't linger if you do not care for it). As with other Era Organics items, I am loving the natural ingredients and quality product. It is so silky and creamy while gently cleansing my face. It feels luxurious! I tried this brands face wash and moisturizer. I tent to have oily skin and was looking for a product to help cleanse, and provide nutrients to help with balancing my skin and minimize breakouts. This face wash is a little different than most, it doesn't lather like some do, however it still does a great job cleaning. It leaves the skin feeling clean but doesn't leave the skin feeling dry. I highly recommend trying out the moisturizer with the face wash, both paired together have really helped my skin. Leaves my face feeling clean, but does not strip away the natural moisture. I have not had any pimples since I have begun using, and the smell is wonderful! The bottle is good sized and should last a good long while if only used as a facial wash (as opposed to using for body wash). I have not tried using it as a body wash...it works so well on my face I want to save it for that! This is an excellent cleanser for combination, oily or normal skin (we have all three types in our household, and everyone loves it). i LOVE the smell of this face wash. It brings back memories of my childhood when my mom had Tea Tree EVERYTHING!!! My skin feels smooth and clean after using the facewash. I am prone to breakouts on my shoulders too, so I also use it there in the shower. A little goes a long way.  This cleanser suds up very well, so I only need a small dab to wash my face.  I use dermablend, which is a waterproof makeup, to conceal spots on my face, and it even removes that!  I like the mintyish smell and the creamy consistency.  It doesn't dry out my face either.  I am 45 and have combination skin.  I believe it contains salycilic acid, which is great because I occassionally get a small pimple in my nose area... prob from the makeup. this is a really nice facewash!  It has a great smell, cleans my face very well, does not leave any greasy feeling or residue.  It does not lather like soap, but goes on nicely and washes off very easily.  The Tea Tree Oil is the main smell but is not overpowering.  I use about a dime size drop and a little goes a very long way!  I end up wiping the rest off on my chest & arms after washing my face with that amount.  I would definitely purchase this product again. Smooth  and silky. There is a light clean scent of the tea tree oil but not overpowering. I have sensetive skin and was able to use this with no problem. I was esantly suprised that it left my skin feeling soft and had help where I had dry skin. Mark's wife here. As my skin has changed over the years, I've tried to find face wash that will be effective during all times of the month. I finally have. I've used it for a month and my skin has noticeably calmed down on the breakouts throughout the month. The scent isn't overwhelming-as tea tree oil can be sometimes....at least to me. It suds up wonderfully and only a small amount is needed. Super easy to wash with and rinse off, no weird residue, just clean feeling skin. Love this face wash. I am an origins addict, but looking for other options. I have tried many different brands of essential oils, but I can tell this is REAL tea tree (melaleuca) oil which is excellent for acne. When you use it, it is thick and strongly scented due the concentration of the oils. You can tell it will be effective. I do not use it to take off my eye makeup, just to clean my skin and help prevent acne. My skin feels great afterwards. This product made my face feel wonderful! It wasn't all dried out after using but it felt tight and clean. It is a large bottle and a good amount for the price. A little bit definitely goes a long way. It also smells really good! I recently received this product and I love it.  I use it along with Era Organics facial moisturizer and mud mask.  My face feels amazing after using these products.  I am not a fan of the scent of this face wash, but because I love the product and how it makes my face feel, I can tolerate it.  It doesn't require more than a dime size to clean my face.  Era Organics has quickly become my favorite, natural line of care for my face. I am a huge fan of organic face cleansers and this tea tree oil face cleanser is now one of my favorites.  My face feels so clean after I use it and it uses tea tree essential oils to make it that way.  Ocassionally I used to get slight breakouts, but after starting to use this cleanser with my regimen, I haven't had a single break out (fingers crossed).  I most definitely recommend if you are looking for a better, organic face cleanser. Great price for such a large bottle. Leaves my face feeling very clean, but not striped to the point it feels dry. Going to try on my make up brushes as well, will update. Will buy again. I started using this and immediately fell in love.  It makes my face feel so clean and well polished.  It smells great and doesn't leave my face feeling oily or dried out.  Give this a try! Very Nice Lather. Scent is most like that of Tea Tree as advertised. So far it has made my complexion stay clear and blemish free. I love the natural ingredients, and no harsh cleansers. I've only been using a few days but so far I really like it. I have super sensitive skin so I'm excited that it is gentle and not upsetting my skin. Smells great like I'm in a spa LOL. I've struggled finding a face cleanser that clears up my acne without drying out my face terribly. This natural tea tree oil not only works great but also smells amazing and leaves my face feeling so clean. I highly recommend it! One word LOVE!!! It smells good,it cleans good, doesn't burn your eye! It's perfect!! Mild cleanser for the acne prone face. Smells clean and mild, not overpowering like some tea tree oil products tend to. Doesn't foam up, but you only need a little bit to cover your whole face so it is cost effective. It is a good size too! Will last quite some time if you only use it for your face. My face feels clean but not dry afterwards. Definitely a good product. I've been using this cleanser for over a week and love the way it makes my skin feel.  It doesn't feel tight and dry after using like some others do! My face isn't oily or acne prone, but as I was reading about this product I noticed that it also stated that if you have dry skin this could work. I have been using it now for about a month and in combination with their repair cream, my skin has not felt healthier in a long time. I will definitely continue to buy this. Now if I could just get my teenager to try it. This face wash has been great for my family. Since we all have different skin types it is perfect for all of us.Especially for acne and sensitive skin. It is sulfate free and I can actually recognize the ingredients. It makes my skin feel soft and super clean.  I also reccomend using a good moisturizer afterward. I would give this 10 stars if I could! The green tree scent is nice, powerful but not to burn your nostrils out. It makes my face feel CLEAN and cleaned up a few blemishes that I had going on that day as well. I am careful not to use around the eyes in case of irritation. This removes my makeup, leaves my skin clean and clear! My face has never looked better! I love how clear my skin looks since I started using this face wash. The cleaner smells like tea tree oil, and feels great on my face. After using it, my skin feels firmer and looks clearer. I would highly recommend you try this product. My tween uses this as her daily face cleanser. It is gentle enough for daily use. It's natural ingredients have been great for acne prone, hormonal skin. I use it occasionally and find it cleans well. My skin is soothed by it. The smell is refreshing, particularly if you like tea tree oil. This cleanser goes on smooth as silk! All I needed was a small amount and it spread over my whole face. As I rubbed it into my skin for the 30 seconds that they recommend, it lathered up some and felt wonderful! The smell was very soothing and relaxing as I breathed it in. My skin felt cool and refreshing while rubbing and even after rinsing the cleanser off. When I dried my face off my skin was so soft! I absolutely love this cleanser!! I do like this moisturizing, natural face cleanser.  I use it in the shower every night to wash off my makeup.  It does a good job getting all makeup off.  I like that it's all natural.  My acne-prone skin has been softer, clearer and smoother since using this. I would use this again. I purchased this product because I was looking for a great cleanser for my son. He is 15 years old and gets the occasional bumps and outbreaks, and we wanted something light and sensitive for his face. A little dot goes a long way! You don't need alot. It is creamy and makes the face feel refreshed after cleaning it. This face wash is great.  It leaves my face feeling clean and soft.  I have been using it for about a week and I have seen many of my existing blemishes clearing and haven't had any new ones pop up.  It has a very nice scent. Love this cleanser. Strong yet gentle. Great ingredients. A little bit goes a long way so use sparingly. The more you massage into you skin the better, so take the 39 seconds to rub in circular motion to get the full benefits. Neutral smell. I LOVE this product. I have been dealing with roseaca since I was 16. I have tried everything eventually gave up and asked my Dr. for medication. Since using this face wash I was able to stop the medication and manage my issue with a simple face wash ❤ I have very sensitive face with rosacea. This cleanser is very gentle but gets the old makeup, dirt, and sweat off my face with ease! It goes on like aloe vera gel and is actually very soothing. I'm very impressed! Thank you, will order again! I've used this cleanser twice, and I can already notice a difference in my skin. Its usually so oil, even with minimal product. This cleanser has been amazing. Im so glad I decided to try it This cleanser! It's my favorite! It's so luxurious! I feel like I'm cleaning my face with satin slime- which sounds unappealing but its actually very relaxing! I love that its so smooth and smells great too! I will be reordering more when Im out! Been using about a week and it has my face feeling cleaner and less ""acneish"" than previously. I love the natural ingredients and small company attention you get. This tea tree face cleaner is a great cleaner to clean out the pores and leave your skin feeling fresh and clean. Tea tree has antiseptic properties that will prevent and heal blemishes. Trust the reviews! Love this product, and would recommend to anyone. It's a nice 8 oz bottle that should last a while so don't be cheap when it comes to your face, this product is worth it.  The company will give you a 60 day money back if you don't like it which goes to show they're confident in it! Smells nice and makes your face feel nice and smooth not overly dry like everything else I've tried. I am in love with my new face wash.  I have very sensitive skin so always worried about using a new product.  I can say that I have been using this wash just on my face for the past 2 weeks and I have had no skin blemishes or breakouts.  I love the smell of tea tree oil so I was not worried about the smell.  It is a very light smell so that is a plus.  The bottle is a good size so I can see this lasting me for months because a little goes a long way.  Since I have had great success with the wash I am looking into buying the cream that goes with it. Love this stuff, my face feels so clean and oil free after using this! Moisturizing is important tho because your face will dry out a little. Smells good, and a dime size drop gets my whole face I have super sensitive skin. My face is red and easily irritated. I noticed a difference in the softness immediately.  I would recommend This is a great cleanser.  It leaves my skin feeling clean but does not over dry it.  I even forget to put moisturizer on some days and my skin does't feel tight or dry at all. Good Lathers up very nicely. It has a nice clean smell & leaves your face feeling fresh & clean. Love it so far! I am 38 and have more problems with my skin now than I did as a teen. I have combination skin, so where other cleansers have left dry patches around my mouth and nose, this one has not. Been using it for over a week and haven’t had any new breakouts. My skin feels better, looks better and old reddened areas from past breakouts have improved quite a bit in a short time. I will definitely be repurchasing! I tend to always have a broken out face, since I've started using this I definitely can see a difference. Has a slight smell of Tea Tree to me not as strong as I would like LOL. Great product I like the smell of this face wash.  The texture was interesting...it reminds me of a hand soap more than a foamy face wash.  This lets you use less, so the bottle lasts a while. Arrived right on time as promised! Works great and I love the price point. Left my face feeling super soft and reffreshed I will definitely be ordering from this seller again. Thanks so much! This cleanser is very creamy and I love the smell of tea tree oil. I have been a fan of tea tree oil for years and am glad to have a facial cleanser that contains this. I've been using this for the past 2 weeks, great product.  Doesn't irritate my skin, got rid of all my blemishes I had, and makes my face smooth.  Highly recommend it! I have really gotten into Tea tree and its health benefits.  I really liked this body wash.  The scent is no too overbearing, which can happen with tea tree and it is a good body wash.  I highly recommend it. This cleanser is great! It really makes my face feel clean. It has a pleasant scent and rinses off well.  I use it daily and it doesn't dry my skin out at all. This face wash really cleans but doesn't feel like it strips my face. Natural ingredients so you know what you're putting on your skin. You don't need much so will last a long time. This is a great cleaner. It has a mild smell that is slightly floral. but it is very light. If you are after bubbles this foams up nicely but not over the top. For my combination skin it has been working well. I have not had any breakout due to changing cleansers. I have not had any problem with is drying out my skin or leaving it greasing.. I'm trying to go as natural and organic as possible with the products I put on my body and this face washer works well.It also helps controlling the brightness of my oily skin. I love it. I'm sensitive to most fragrances but this was mild and pleasant. My face didn't feel dried out after use and was nice and clean. Realy good face wash, gets rid of tge oily skin amd works great. Love love love this cleanser! It removes my makeup as well! Refreshing light tea tree scent. Works well for my combination/sensitive skin dry/oily/rosacea. I've been searching for a cleanser that doesn't exacerbate my facial redness. It's worth the purchase! I'm hooked! I bought this for my acne prone skin. Very oily but harsh cleansers would strip too much moisture out of my skin. Two weeks into using this and I’ve noticed a huge difference. My face is so much clearer. Truly appreciate it N will be repurchasing. A little goes a long way! It is lightly scented and my skin did not dry up! Looking forward to using it daily. This is cleanser is just awesome.  The price that I got for was great.  I will be reordering it Like the natural ingredients. Very smooth wash, doesn't suds much if that's what you're looking for. Seems good for sensitive skin. Lose this item. Washes off make up great and smells nice. Helps my skin against redness I really like how it makes my face feel so clean without drying me out too much and how my skin is less oily in the mornings after sleeping. Awesome stuff!! My sensitive and acne prone skin loves it. It also smells pretty good and the texture is so creamy. I use it as a body wash as well! Luv it!! A little goes a long way too!! I LOOOOVE IT!!! PIMPLES BE GONE!!! IT WORKS SO WELL I SWEAR!"
B0081E6X2Q," Love the wipes & always timely. very gentle on the face This is the only makeup remover wipe that I have found that does not bother my skin. 1-2 swipes of an area can easily get rid of my foundation and eye makeup. Very effective and nice smell. Arrived damaged and amazon took care of it anyway. Great product. I really like these.. they have a great smell and gentle . I rolled my eyes at these and the costs when I can just use babywipes far cheaper. Til I was visiting my niece, didn't have baby wipes, and tried it. I could not believe how incredibly well these work. I came home and ordered 3 packages. I only use when I have makeup, because.. well, they are not cheap. But they really are wonderful. These work great to gently take off makeup, and they do a much better job of it than just trying to use a washcloth. They also get mascara off easily without smearing it all over my face. I've also used them to take off face paint. They are gentle and smell nice, and I haven't experienced any skin irritation yet. No more skin issues since I started using these.  I use the calming lotion after cleaning my face.  The combination has solved all my sensitive skin problems. I switched from another Aveeno Cleansing Wipe.  I have been buying Aveeno Wipes for years. So far, these seem good.  They do not have a scent which is a bonus.Recommend. These are great. Take everything off, stay moist.  I ordered more.  Aside from Nutrogena's makeup wipes, which can be a little to harsh and expensive, these are my new go to. Love these! They leave my skin feeling great and some acne actually cleared up after using these for a week. I switched from Olay lavender wipes, which I thought were super gentle. I've never used a makeup remover this gentle before! I have super sensitive skin and eyes and I loves these! These work great at removing make up without feeling too greasy. They smell fresh and stay moist if the pouch remains closed correctly. Great to travel with! These wipes are great! My skin is so soft after wiping away my makeup. They are even better than some of the higher end wipes and of course other drugstore face wipes. No harshness feeling to the skin. No dry feeling either after your face cools off. Great product! These feel so good on my super sensitive skin! I have rosacea and so most things irritate my skin.. These are also bigger and thicker and more cloth-like than other make-up wipes. They do a great job removing my make-up; even my eye make-up. I feel so fresh after using them. By far the best make up remover wipes. Neutrogenas made removing make up unpleasant-stung. These are so great and smell good. I have tried many makeup remover wipes.  There is a softer feel to Aveeno that is so  much nicer than many of the other brands and the size of the towelette is larger than many other brands.  I originally purchased these for a trip and liked them so much, now use them at home. I've tried a lot of different facial wipes and these are now going to be my go-to. The light scent is awesome!! Not overbearing or chemically, which is what has turned me off from a lot of other brands. It also actually removes my mascara and most other wipes don't do that without ripping out my lashes. Great product! 10/10. Calming and very effective, even for waterproof make-up. I love the smell too!! My new go-to Makeup removing brand. Some wipes leave residue on my face or are rough on my eyes. These wipes are truly so gentle that I'll never go back to the Neutrogena wipes I've used always. I am a loyal Aveno-ist. I use the Ultra Calming lotion daily and my rosacia symptoms disappear! Highly recommended! I've tried many different brands of makeup removing wipes and these are by far my favorite. They don't leave an oily residue like almost all other wipes do, and ONE wipe gets my entire face clean with no problem. Even waterproof mascara is no match for these wipes, which again, I haven't found to be the case with almost any other brand. Doesn't hurt your eyes, doesn't sting, and has a fantastic scent. Love love love these. I really like these wipes. My skin is very sensitive and prone to painful redness. I originally tried Yes To Cucumber wipes, which left a weird film on my face and burned. I use the Aveeno Ultra Calming lotion, and really like that, so I was excited to find these wipes. The smell is pleasant, it doesn't leave a film, and it doesn't irritate my skin. I don't wear tons of makeup, just a light powder foundation with eyeliner and mascara, and one wipe is enough to take all my makeup off. Happy with my purchase, and I will order again! These wipes leave my skin clean, smooth, and completely makeup-free. All of the dirt, oil and makeup on my face comes off completely with a gentle swipe. Other makeup removing wipes I have tried require using 2-3 wipes, but you only need 1 to do the job with this product-- very cost efficient. Plus, there's no harsh fragrances which makes it great for sensitive skin. Highly recommend for clean, glowing skin! My wife said that the Aveeno Ultra-Calming Makeup Removing Wipes that I bought for her -- had a smooth cloth-like texture to the wipe, which easily cleaned the skin oils and makeup off her face and left her skin feeling smooth and soft.  She also said that the Aveeno Wipes were lightly moist with a faint melon-like fragrance, they never burned her eyes, and they kept her skin from drying out for many hours.  Excellent product. Gentle and doesn't leave any residue feeling on my face. After years of searching, finally a product that doesn't burn my skin. I love these wipes. I tried the product to compare with Garnier.  I love this product better because it cleanses better and leaves my face moisturized. I have sensitive skin and zero tolerance for a makeup removal routine. These are made just for me. They remove my makeup well and don't irritate my skin. I love these wipes. I have sensitive skin and roseacea. They're the best I've found. These wipes were wonderful! I used these through out the day during work (I work with kids so I’m constantly running around, they were awesome when I needed to freshen up my face!) and I used them after heavy make up and a night out. They leave your skin clean and moisturizer without and dryness or irritation! Very gentle on the skin and removed make up very easily! Love the product. these remove make up really well and smell amazing. I love these wipes. I loved this Make up remover, it doesn't damage my face and smells Good. Best makeup wipes I've ever used! I love these. They smell great and are very calming on the skin. They're soft and don't irritate my skin one bit, but get makeup off very well.  They're also very moisturizing, but never greasy. I have oily skin and it gives me the perfect amount of moisture, whereas many makeup wipes will dry my skin out or make it super oily. Bottom line, I looovveee these! Great makeup removing wipes. They clean makeup off with ease and smell great. These are great for removing makeup, but also oil removal before bed. They not only help remove all my waterproof make-up but also help relieve my skin from sun burn pain! Gentel on the skin. One wipe goes a long way and is usually all I need to get all the make-up of. Leaves skin clean and soft. Aveeno is a great product there is no scent with this one Smells clean, works well and my wife seems to like them. Great cleanser.  Perfect for sensitive skin (in my case). I have eczema so my skin is extremely sensitive, especially on my face. After trying many different soaps and cleansers that would remove makeup without irritating my skin I've finally found a winner! The dirt and makeup come right off without excssive rubbing (even eye makeup). I just wished I would've tried these sooner, but now I'll never use anything else. I'm a lazy person when it comes to things like making two extra minutes to remove mascara before tumbling to bed. I keep these on the bedside table and it's a breeze. I've tried going back to other wipes (Burt's Bees, Simple, Neutrogena, CVS brand), but none are as soft or pleasant smelling as these. Plus the ""click"" closure (rather than one of those lame sticker tops) keeps wipes fresh til the last one. Freshness!No need to wash after.Perfect for travel bag. This product I love and use daily...excellent packaging...superior product...good packaging and delivery on time.  Thank you. I wrote a review a while back blaming this product for an allergic reaction that turned out to be an infection.  My deepest apologies to Aveeno, and anyone who read that review.  I was wrong.I'm now on my third package of these wipes.  I use one on my face every night, and most nights, that's all I use.  My skin looks and feels great, and if I do use a serum or cream, it seems to be absorbed much more quickly than if I used soap and water to clean my face.  I'm delighted by Aveeno's effectiveness and ease of use. Love it! So soft on my skin and smells great too. Love it!  Takes off makeup easily and quickly Easy to use and really gentle on your face. My face feels really clean and fresh after. These are the best for sensitive skin. They don't cause any redness or burning (which ALL other makeup wipes do to my skin), they take off all my makeup with no problem and they actually have a very pleasant smell! Love them! Removes my entire face of makeup with just one wipe (primer, concealer, foundation, blush, shadow, eyeliner, waterproof mascara, lipstick!). The most gentle wipe I've used. I purchased this on a whim and I'm glad I did. I like this even more than my neutrogena wipes because they don't burn my sensitive eyes. Light smell is pleasing as well. This is the first wipe I've bought in a while, and I have to say I was completely impressed. Super effective and left my skin feeling remarkably soft and refreshed. Had just gone for hike and it was amazing how much cleaner I felt afterwards and just how much it removed from my face. Will definitely be purchasing again! This is the only product I've found that removes -all- of my makeup without irritating my skin, bless. These are my absolute favorite cleansing wipes. The scent is subtle and calming and they feel very gentle on the face. I only use them on my lazy days, and they go a great job of removing my makeup, including my waterproof makeup. I used to use Neutrogena, which I find too chemically now after using Aveeno, and have also tried Ponds, which do not remove my makeup as well as the Aveeno ones. Will definitely continue buying these! The best towel to removed makeup With very very sensitive skin it is hard for me to find something that doesn't break me out. I was pleasantly shocked to find that my skin handles this so well. I don't feel it adds to the breakouts and they are moist enough to really get the makeup off, even mascara.Your face will feel oily afterwards and it does take a bit to go away, but if my skin likes it, I like it! Amazing!! Love these! I have extremely sensitive skin and have no irritation with these. Removes all the makeup every time! This product definitely works to rid your face of makeup. These work great even with waterproof mascara. It's a quick and easy way to get all makeup off. These are the best makeup removal wipes I've used! (From Neutrogena to Clinique!) Unlike other products, these do not have that chemical/alcohol smell, and they removed my waterproof mascara so easily! My favorite make up removing wipes - I've been using this for probably 5 years now.  It cleans better than yes to cucumber and burt's bees, but does not sting like neutrogena.  I use liquid waterproof eyeliner, so I really need something comfortable for daily use on my eyes, and these are great!  They are a little pricier than others, but it is worth it! This smells absolutely amazing. Whenever I use these cloths, my boyfriend sniffs my face for the rest of the night. It's ridiculous. It removes make up just fine. You don't even have to rinse your face off with water after use. The next morning, my face is extra soft and feels super moisturized. They just work to get all the makeup off. Have repurchased many, many times. Always come timely and as promised. love Best Ever wipes Love this item use them every day. A must have and love the fact that I can get it drop at home by Amazon thank you Amazon! Smells & works amazing Other wipes have irritated my skin.  Not with these.  After washing my face with a cleanser, I decided to try this out and it took even more makeup off my face.  Overall I am very pleased with this product.  I keep a package in my car for after the gym as well. I absolutely love these.  I've tried a lot of makeup wipes, including expensive boutique brands.  These are my favorite, hands down.  I have very sensitive skin due to rosacea and these do not set me off.  I still get better results by doing the whole traditional makeup removal routine, but for lazy nights, I don't feel a bit guilty using these.  Subscribe and Save makes it a bargain and completely effortless. My wife loves this product to gently clean her face. The wipes are effective, and the dispenser is easy to use. What more to say. Unlike other packaging, Aveeno has a plastic lid that securely closes which keeps the cleansing cloths moist.  They thoroughly remove make-up and are gentle on the skin. These don't ""sting"" as much as the other wipes I used previously (Yes to Cucumber brand.)  They smell nice and do the job!  I recommend them for those with sensitive skin. I was skeptical about buying this product since I tend to have allergies to certain make up products. This wipe works well. I deeply cleans the pore and reduce the effects of clog...awesome. It leaves a nice glow to the face.I would recommend this to anyone. good I love these makeup removing wipes. I have extremely dry sensitive skin and use these nightly before I cleanse my face. They take off my makeup easily and do not leave my face dry or irritated. They are also great for late nights when all you can do is get your makeup off. The smell is also amazing. easy to use, and for traveling, loving them best make up remover Mild for my sensitive skin.  Use them daily.  Best product ever. The only thing that calms me down. Best face cleansing cloths that I have found.  They remove all your make-up, don't dry out your skin & smell nice. These have literally saved my post-40 skin from breakouts. Since I switched to using these exclusively, my breakouts have virtually disappeared, even the hormonal breakouts. Love these. I have used a lot of makeup removing wipes and these are by far the best. One wipe easily removes all of my face makeup including all eye makeup and mascara. They smell nice and leave my skin feeling clean and refreshed. I highly recommend them. Perfect for face. I developed rosacea as I aged and other make up removing cloths would burn my face if it was in a flare up mode. This does it, it is gentle and had never once caused me further skin irritations. I love it! These are the only makeup wipes I use. They can get all my makeup off totally effectively. I can even rub them all up in my eyes without any stinging. What are these made of? Witchcraft? Anyway, definitely recommend them. They smell nice too. I've tried other makeup remover cloths but nothing compares to these. They are very gentle and glide across your skin but are super effective in removing  makeup and dirt. I use them to remove eye makeup and even waterproof mascara. Awesome product! I leave these by my bed and use them at night which helps my skin stay clean. They def. take makeup off also. I was really surprised how strong the scent is on these beings that they are made for sensitive skin. But after using them, i immediately looked past that.They do a amazing job at removing all of my make up. I was surprised to see how much makeup came off on the wipes. I would recommend these to anyone! These are great. They remove the makeup without being too harsh or leaving my face feeling dry. Plus they smell great!The packaging is really nice because it has a hard top close, which keeps the wipes wet instead of drying out. Doesn't burn my eye lids after use. WOOHOOO! These take off all makeup (including eye) with one sheet.  Maybe not waterproof mascara, but surely regular.  They are soft and pretty good sized.  The pack is resealable so they stay moist.  Not necessary to rinse and face feels clean and soft.  Very convenient.  No or very subtle scent, nothing offensive. I have extremely sensitive skin and yet needed something to remove my ""last all day"" type foundation, eyeliner!, and lip stain.  This product gently but fully removes all those products and leaves my skin feeling moisturized and clean.  You may still want to follow it with a quick cleanse, but in a pinch (long, long day at work & just want it off your face before you crash) this works just fine. Best make-up remover wipes I have ever used. I have sensitive skin and often in the past, make up remover wipes always left my face dry and irritated. These leave my face feeling refreshed and with out an annoying reaction. These wipes are great!  They take almost all the make up (mascara is always a little harder to remove).  I used the ones from oil of olay but those have alcohol and hurt my eyes.  These smell great and are soft.  They also leave my face feeling soft.  I recommend, I use these daily and they work great to remove make-up. I do make them smaller as then I can get more uses out of them. Great product for the price. Doesn't dry out my skin and I have less acne breakouts. Removes makeup, leaving skin soft. I don't wear makeup much (maybe once a month) but I do use this to take off sunscreen and whatever gunk is on my face before my shower.  It does have a scent though, I have super sensitive skin and have purchased these many times. One towelette will clean entire face, even waterproof mascara. Wish they sold in travel size!!! I loved them when purchased at the grocery store.  One towelette, which comes perfectly moist, completely cleans off my makeup and mascara without making my face feel dry.  It also has the snap-close top to help the wipes from drying out.  Buying them from this seller saves me two - four dollars per pack, so great deal! I love these makeup remover wipes!  They smell much better than other brands that I've tried, they are gentle on my skin and they get the makeup off my face with ease.  5 Stars!!! These are the only facial cleansing wipes I have tried that DO NOT sting my eyes! These are perfect for quickly removing face and eye makeup without irritation or a strong smell. I have purchased these for myself many times and have gifted them to friends who have also loved them. Love how fresh it smells and how soft it is. smells great, leaves skin feeling smooth and moisturized. my new favorite I use these every day!  They do not dry my skin out and the wipes are very soft, yet exfoliate just enough.  I have been using these for years. Best make up removing pads that I've found!! I love the clean scent too. These are great and work well. I bought the cheaper kind by Aveeno before and liked them but this style doesn't dry out ever thanks to the plastic flap. It smells awesome!!! & work wonders These are my favorite facial wipes. They are very calming and take off all of my make up. The formula they use doesn't tamper with my dry skin. It helps soothe my face and leave it make up free. Love these gentle wipes.  Do the job very well without any scrubbing.  For allergy prone me, this is a product I'll keep using. Very satisfied This product removes all my make up without causing me to breakout. It takes the redness and soothes it for breakouts. This is on subscription for me. Great price, quick shipping. Does the job, plus it doesn't dry my skin out. I'm a big Aveeno person; so to be able to get these shipped to my house is a bonus. The best makeup removing wipes I have ever used - love it.  This is what I will use from now on.  Just purchased it again. I just bought the makeup removing wipes, and I've been very pleased with them. The makeup comes off so easily and I don't have to sit there and wipe for ages. It's easy around the eyes and leaves my face feeling clean and hydrated. I have used Aveeno products for YEARS. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Them!They are priced extremely well onAmazon compared to what I have paid in the past, and what is still advertised, at Walgreens or CVS. LOVE THESE. My favorite face wipes. Makes me feel good and works great on my face to clean and moisturize. My sister has sensitive skin and after trying out so many brands this is her absolute favorite. They won't leave your skin feeling dry or too oily. They work well in removing the makeup and they don't irritate my sensitive skin My absolute favorite makeup removing wipes of all time! It's extremely gentle and effective. Been using this for the past 2 years and I refuse to use anything else. My daughter uses these to remove her stage make up after dance competitions.  She loves how well they work.  They even easily remove fake eyelash glue. The fragrance is the best. My skin gets clean without getting irritated.  Even with my allergies I can use these with no problem. Love anything that is Aveeno. Always great products, good for skin, no irritation, just perfect. These are wonderful! They take off my makeup, and my skin has broken out less after using these. These makeup removing wipes are great. I like the light fragrance and the fact that they remove my makeup without feeling harsh. I will definitely be buying these again! Removed my makeup including mascara as well as, if not better than the Neutrogena makeup wipes I was using. Did not irritate the rosacea on my nose and cheeks like the Netrogena ones. Definitely will continue using! I have used many makeup wipes but none as good as these.  That pink label is plastic and you can open it,  remove the wipes and it clicks back shut so the wipes stay moist until all are used.  No more dried up wipes.  They are very gentle on sensitive skin and still do a great job of cleaning.  You won't go wrong with these . These wipes are amazing These wipes are great. I keep them in my gym bag for a quick on-the-go face wash. They smell really nice, and are excellent for sensitive skin. I really like these wipes because they even get off your eye makeup including your mascara. The smell is a little strong so after I clean my face with them I take a wet wash cloth and get the residue off. They are worth every penny because you don't have to wipe hard to get your makeup off. Does exactly what it says. Removes makeup without drying-out my skin. I don't need to moisturize and it doesn't have a perfumy fragrance. good I am allergic to a lot of ingredients and don't like perfumes, so I thought I would try these and I really like them quite a bit. They are very gentle but do an excellent job of taking off eye make up. They are soft too. I plan on buying more. Easily removes my waterproof clinique mascara.  I cut them in half to make them last longer, but I do like their effectiveness. I've used these for years. They lubricate my lashes. Some other wipes pull and break them. Don't burn my eyes. Keeps my skin soft, the scent is really nice and soothing and it really does a great job removing all of my makeup.  Love this one! Love the calming effect I always have a hard time removing my foundation, no matter what I try.  So I keep trying other products.  These wipes do a great job.  Finally a winner! These wipes are great! They're so gentle on my skin. I recommend I have very sensitive skin these are the best thing I have found. Thank You useful I use these make up wipes each night.

Great product Loveeeeeee it These are the best makeup removing wipes out there.  Gentle and calming to your face but does the job well.  What more can you ask? Takes the first step of cleaning my face so much more convenient.  I will continue to purchase them.  I wish they would make one especially for the eye area. Best wipes iv used ever.... I love this product! its soft and gentle, and leaves a soft feel to your skin! These are awesome. Take the makeup off & have a great smell :) I used to only use Biore. I thought Biore was the best until.... About a year ago I started having a hard time finding the Biore wipes so I went online and still had a hard time finding them in stock anywhere.  So in a hurry and desperate for some wipes, I decided to try a few different brands and ""test"" them out. Aveeno was one of those I tested. All I can say is I'm glad I ""had"" to find an other solution because these Aveeno wipes are the BOMB! I love them. They do the job and they do it ""gently"". I love the scent too.  I feel like my skin is so ""refreshed and energized"" after using them! Thanks Aveeno! Moist, soft, cleansing.....super price and convenient sending.....with subscribing great These are my absolute favorite! I've tried a few and these are the best. Love these wipes!  Super gentle, light moisturizing, but clean well. WORKS GREAT! Only product that doesn't burn my eyes Gentle on my sensitive skin. To start, I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin all over and the skin around my eyes is particularly prone to swelling and redness. Before buying this product, I had been using some all natural pre-moistened makeup removing pads, which occasionally caused issues and eventually stopped being produced. In frantically searching for a replacement, I came across these Aveeno Ultra Calming Makeup Removing Wipes. I purchased them for a few reasons: the wipes are pre-moistened, completely disposable, and they are said to remove makeup without irritating sensitive skin. The third point was key and I have yet to be disappointed. Everything about these wipes is as expected and great with one minor caveat that they do leave a slight residue. I'm not bothered by this as all removers leave something and it is easily cleared off with a tissue.Pros:DisposableWell sealed packaging/doesn't dry out (I used one package over the course of 3 months and it didn't dry out)No reaction on my sensitive skinWipes are soft and not too roughRemoves 95% of my daily makeupCons:Leaves slight residue on skin (but I just wipe my face with a tissue after and this resolves the issue) Love these and they smell delicious. These are great for sensitive skin!! Love it! Arrived on time! Love them--very convenient Love Vernon. It calms my skin as well as removes all my make up. They are large enough that 1 wipe does your entire face my favorite nightly ritual is removing the debris of the day with these Aveeno pads. I've been using these for over a year now.  They work the best, especially for dry skin.  I would recommend to anyone with sensitive skin. My go -to make up remover. Gentle, and smells nice. I have eczema so i can vouche for the gentle part. :) These feel so good on your skin and remove all my makeup before bed. Thanks! I like. Love it! Removes makeup well. Smells amazing, work very well. Very effective in removing make up, leaving soft and clean feeling skin. Works well. Sturdy cloth, gentle on skin. Great. the wipes clean well and are soothing - yes I would recommend them. Love these for my sensitive skin. Except I love these. I have to say I've only tried one other brand. These make my skin feel wonderfully soft and clean. Simply the best facial wipe. Love them. Very best eye makeup remover! gentle and effective for eye makeup removal I have been using Aveeno Ultra Calming Makeup Remover Wipes for almost 2 years now and I love that it only takes 1 wipe to completely remove all of my makeup! I use one side to remove my eye makeup and the other to remove my foundation and blusher.As they come 25 to the package, and I do not wear makeup if staying at home, I am only having to replace them about once a month.They leave my skin feeling clean and fresh and I have had absolutely no issues with breakouts.I have tried a few samples of other make up remover wipes, but I keep coming back to these Aveeno Ultra Calming Makeup Removing Wipes, because the overall results are so wonderful.The dispenser pouch is sealed with a tab which Aveeno instructs me to remove completely, however I have found if I leave it in place after removing a wipe, the wipes tend to retain their moisture for a longer period of time.A+++ Recommendation! Excellent and Soft Really nice thank you nicely and sof It does not dry out my skin like other makeup removers do.  It makes my skin feel so soft and clean!! Excellent for rosaira on face. This review is for Aveeno Ultra Calming Makeup Removing Wipes. Many of the reviews associated with this product on Amazon are reviews for a different Aveeno product. Maybe Amazon can get this straightened out. Anyway, I gave this product (the makeup removing wipes) 5 stars because it works very well for me. I have itchy, sensitive, very reactive skin on my face. I have tried many different brands and this is the only brand that doesn't make my skin go into over-active itchy mode. For me, this is an excellent product and I am so happy to have found it. Great for removing makeup or refreshing your face on a hot, steamy day. A+!! These are my favorite face wipes.  I have 2 teenage daughters and all three of us use these every night to wash our faces before going to bed.  To be honest, we are just too lazy to wash with facial soap and water (and I hate that water get in your hair and down your shirt!).  We just pop these wipes out and get the makeup off in seconds.  All three of us have sensitive skin and these wipes don't make our faces turn red like other brands do. Aveeno Ultra Calming wipes are the best for sensitive skin. They don't have any alcohol in them so they don't dry out my skin, they remove heavy make up like a champ, the towel quality is soft and thick, and they have the nicest soft scent! Wonderful product by a wonderful brand.  My wife uses these daily and is happy she doesn't have to run to the store and can have these in 2 days with Amazon Prime. These are great. They're nice and soft with a really pleasant scent, but also get rid of all of my makeup and seem to exfoliate too. The best makeup removing wipe I have ever used. It leaves my face moist and relieved. Nice and convenient.  My skin looks good when I use these.  Good for after workouts, too. I bought these because I'd been using my children's wet wipes to wash my face every night because I was so tired I couldn't bring myself to actually wash my face. I have a 3 year old, 2 year old, and 6 month old. Evenings are not my best time of day.Originally, I bought the Neutrogena wipes. I liked them, but I hated the packaging. The little top part that is supposed to stick back down to keep the wipes moistened lost its stickiness about 3/4 way through the package, leaving the final few wipes less than sufficiently moist. I saw these as an alternative and figured I'd try them out. I like them even more. They leave my face feeling soft and the smell.... I HATE almost ANYTHING scented (I never wear perfume or scented lotion) but for some reason, I love this. I guess it's subtle enough to not overpower. I have pretty sensitive skin and this has kept me from breaking out. Much better than Huggies wet wipes. :) I've been using these for over a year now and its sooo perfect. I wear waterproof liquid eyeliner and waterproof mascara and it gets both of them off great. It has a light smell which is fine, I'm sensitive to strong smells. I tried other wipes like Elf and they aren't any good. Sometimes if I don't wear that much makeup I can cut the wipe in half and save them cause they are kind of pricey. Cheaper than Target though. These are great makeup removing wipes. I used to get these wipes from my local pharmacy, but it was getting expensive.  I found these here on Amazon for three bucks less.  I grabbed two this shipment. I will definitely get more because I love taking off my makeup with these wipes. I need two to remove almost everything before I wash my face, but that's ok.  These smell nice and they do not burn my skin.  Some of the leading brands say for sensitive skin, but they burn my face and sting.  These are perfect for me and now I can get them as an add on when I order Prime eligible items. I absolutely lol love these wipes. I usually use my daughter's wipes and they would leave my face red and irritated. These Aveeno wipes were soft and moisturizing. I did a full look with foundation,concealer, eye shadow, eyeliner, etc. The only thing I forgot was mascara. I only used 3 wipes and didn't have to scrub my face during removal. They weren't drenched in some funny smelling liquid. They smelt amazing and had enough solution in them to get the job done. A must buy.Photos attached These wipes are amazing!  I have sensitive skin with eczema on my forehead and around my eyes, and these wipes do not irritate my sensitive skin or my eczema.  Every other cleansing wipe or cleanser either irritates my eczema or my sensitive skin or both, so I was beyond excited when I found out that these wipes don't irritate my skin.  The scent is mild, without a floral (thankfully) or strong cleanser smell.  They are gentle, non-exfoliating wipes.  The packaging keeps the wipes moist unless they aren't used in a timely manner.  They take makeup off really well, though there are some waterproof makeups that can be a bit more difficult to get off with these wipes because they are gentle.  I would recommend these wipes to anyone thinking about them for sensitive skin - they are great!! Absolutely incredible make up wipes. I use a lot of wipes, because I wear a lot of makeup daily. So, I will usually wipe my make up off prior to cleansing with a wipe. I've used Neutrogena, Burts Bees, Oil of Olay, Murad, baby wipes, dollar store brands, And Yes to Cucumbers to name a few, in the past.These Aveeno wipes may be my favorite so far. I like them because:1.) It takes off all of my Makeup with only one wipe!!! I usually have to use an average of 2 wipes from other brands I've tried.2.) My makeup come off confortably with minimum effort. It glides off easily and even takes off stubborn mascara that is usually more of a challenge with other wipes.3.) It leaves my skin soft, and does not leave a residue. Sometimes I skip cleansing afterward. My skin feels fresh and clean with little to no risidual feeling.I'll be switching over happily to Aveeno wipes from now on. Hope this helps. :)"
B00P1JNZUW," Love love this skin care line. A little pricey for products that don’t last long but I love how my skin feels. I’ve been trying bareminerals skin care line and it just isn’t the same. Once I’m out of it I’m going back to verage if I can wait that long. My skin loves this stuff. Love the prouduct  and the smell of all of them, I will purchase more. Excellent product and Service. G-G-Great products! Love this product. Timely delivery It's gentle on your skin and it smells amazing. It's worth the price. It is a natural product. It feels good on my skiin. It absorbs right away. No oily residue. great product So far, so good. Have only been using it for 1.5 weeks and my skin is looking more hydrated! Love these products absolutely awesome product! Highly recommended. Great line of skin care. A must in my routine. that is very good. I love it Love this great product you won't be disappointed I love this product but I am very into essential oils! I wish that the proportions were the same for each item. It seems one item doesn't last as long as the others. But overall this product is outstanding! My daughter gave me this for my birthday. I am 61.  I've been using it less than a month and I've had people stop and ask me what I do to keep my skin looking so healthy. I have had to get used to the smells of the essential oils but I now find it pleasant.  The difference the hydrating serum makes is worth ALL of it! I will buy it next time. I absolutely love this product, however, due to the price, I will not purchase again.  The serum fills only half of the bottle, the other half is taken up by the dispenser.  I wish it weren't so expensive. I purchased this set directly from Doterra as I am a member.  I received this set just a few days ago but already I can see a change in the smoothness and vibrancy of my complexion.  I also suffer from adult acne and this seems to have calmed my skin to where the areas around my jaw line are now smooth and show no signs of new pimples.  I also use foundation every morning but try not to use too much as my skin gets oily; however, with using these products my face does not have that sheen that usually happens a few hours later.  It smells a little mediciny but I'm willing to deal with that to have a clean complexion free of blemishes.  I'm very pleased with these products and if these results keep up, will be my new skin care regime. I've been using Verage for about 6 months now after a good friend who is a doTerra rep recommended it to me. I was really hesitant to try something so expensive because I honestly have never been sure about essential oils, kinda thinking the whole thing was some new age BS. But I tried it anyway and was shocked, my skin has never been better! Before this I was using proactiv and retinol products for years which was pretty good but I still used to break out a bit, but with the verage I don't break out anymore at all, I can't believe it! It is very expensive but it's been totally worth it for me, plus it smells so good! I will never stop buying it. I only use it at night so that it will last longer. During the day I use a vitamin C toner and moisturizer. I don't think my skin has ever looked better. i became a doTerra consultant and immediatly started on there vitamin set, what a miracle doTerra is, love there entire vitamin lines, my hair has changed to a healthier appearances and is easier now to style, i have tried there shampoo & conditioner, LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!! Now i have there facial skin care collection of this Verage, My skin looks healthier and more brighter in appearances, my skin is very sensitive and using this entire skin care system didnt cause No itchiness, and no dryness...love there toner especially...its very gentle and little sudsy when you put it on your face...but dont rinse it out, continue using the moisturizer and there serum..LOVE all 4 of there products,!!!! next one im going to try is there 1 and 2 facial scrum system!!!!! Love doTerra!!!! I LOVE this product! My skin has never looked better. I don't have to wear foundation anymore because my complexion is Fantastic! There are SO MANY skin regimens on the market these days and I've heard some horror stories about many of the ""high end"" anti-aging products... I can honestly say that this skin care line ROCKS. I started using it at age 30 so I didn't have big problem areas that needed immediate attention, however, now I break out less, my skin is smoother, more vibrant & so much healthier! The best part? Knowing that I am healing my skin with the essential oils & preventing future damage...NOT ruining it like some of the awful chemical infested products on the market that promise miracle results. :) Found this product as I live in a dry climate.  Skin is revitalized."
B00BFWAZ2K," After using this for a few weeks I'm finding that I have fewer breakouts.  As this cleanser can be somewhat drying, I often substitute a mild cleanser like Cetaphil every few washes.  Because of the exfoliation, I no longer feel the need to bring out the Clarisonic, which is a real bonus for me. I have been using this Mandelic Acid exfoliating cleanser for over 3 years. I love it! It cleanses my skin and gets rid of dead skin, leaving my skin soft and luminescent. I recommended! I have been using this product for several years and am very happy with the results.  It exfoliates my skin without drying it out. Great product. Great seller I have used so many products to treat my acne. I have been to different dermatologists and have tried their products but this is the only product that worked wonders! I stopped getting acne when I started using this. The price is very reasonable too. A bottle would probably last more a month. Works great, repeat buy. Mandelic is the hidden greatness in skincare products that needs to get out there. Vivant products are reliable and good quality. Love this line. Absolutely fan-freaking-tastic!  This is miracle stuff.  Whenever I'm having a breakout I use this and it works like a charm.  It's a scrub and is too harsh to use daily, which it states. It helps remove any flakiness and makes my face baby smooth.  I really like the smell of it as well. I am a fan of Vivant's products for a couple years now.  Pretty good stuff and last a while.  I alternate this with their exfoliate and my skin is very clean and clear.  I am a guy so I like simple and this seems to do the trick. Recommended to me by an esthetician, I used to buy this at the facial salon, and then from the Vivant website, but Amazon is the cheapest place I've found that carries this product. I use it every day and I love it! The exfoliating beads feel very nice. Sometimes I use it on my back. This was amazing for my skin! Smells good and the exfoliation isn't too rough. Love this product. I swim outside and use zinc oxide on my face, and this is really effective in removing it and keeping my skin smooth and clear. I've been using it for a couple of years, and I really like it. Where was this when I was in high school?! LOVE This stuff! Helped clear up any active acne! Great brand! Definitely buying more products! I bought this product together with the wash to try to treat my recalcitrant acne.  Use sparingly as it can be very, very drying.  I use about once every 2-3 weeks and sometimes go longer because of the drying effect.  It helps, but then again, I have not found anything that completely clears my acne yet. I use this along with the cleanser and toner. My acne spots are still there but are clearing up slowly. My acne however is gone!!! These products are drying therefore its best to follow up with a good moisturizer i used avocado oil and it works like a charm. My only problem was that I fell asleep with the exfoliator on my face one night and work up with horrible dry dark scales on my face, It eventually went away and that was obviously my fault in the beginning. Not an everyday cleanser, but great to add in 2-3 nights a week for exfoliation. I found it too drying when I used it everyday. Wonderful product. There was some dryness as my skin adjusted but nothing a good moisturizer couldn't handle. My go to/favorite facial cleanser, I break out and pick my skin and this helps with pigmentation and also keeping bacteria at bay. Yes Excellent Amazing cleanser! It makes my face feel so clean!!! It is worth the price. You will se great results! Best acne treatment I've ever used! Best product for 40+ age group and makes my skin glow. Used in combination with green tea antioxidant cleanser. Great scent that was light. Amount and size of micro-beads really helped to exfoliate and deep clean my face -especially around the nose area. Some initial (light) stinking the first few times of use which quickly subsided as my skin got used to the Mandelic. I was using this in supplement to a weekly 25% Mandelic Peel which in combination did wonders for some hyper pigmentation I had from post-acne scaring. It's almost time for a new bottle, and I definitely plan to incorporate this into my weekly skin regiment. I swear by this product, my face is clearer than with any other cleanser Within a couple of weeks I can see a difference in my skin. I definitely plan on staying with this product line. Love it! So far it has been effective in treating my oily acne prone skin. My skin feels so refreshed after each use. My favorite cleanser. It helps fight hyperpigmentation. excellent product! This stuff totally works on my combination skin.  I've searched high and low for something that wouldn't dry out my skin but also take care of sporadic deep acne + black heads in the t-zones.  I only use this stuff once a day, at night, and my skin is looking fabulous. I've been using it for about a year. LOVE this product!! I have combination skin and am prone to breakouts. I've tried several very expensive face washes in the past and really liked Murad but felt like it just want working after using it for so long. Was introduced to Vivant by a Nurse Practioner and LOVE it! I break out like crazy when off of this stuff. My esthetician recommended this to me to help with my adult hormonal acne. It doesn't clear them up completely, but it definitely helps a ton. It smooths out my skin, and my skin tone is the kind that scars with dark spots for weeks and weeks even after a blemish has healed, and it helps even the skin tone of that too. I will never go without this stuff. I've been using this product for about 4 years now. It has changed my life. I was actually lucky enough to have known Dr. Fulton, the creator, before he passed.Of course, when I first became his patient, I thought he was just trying to push his product on me. But I bought it any way, because I was desperately dealing with adult acne and cysts. This was together with the mandelic pads, completely cleared me up. I have had a few cysts since I started using the problem, but I would say 1-3 a years, which is a big improvement from cysts every month. The best part? It doesn't dry your skin, even for us sensitive types. I've tried all those other infomercial types, and they all just left me red like a tomato.What's the difference? After I got to know Dr. Fulton as his patient, I realized how dedicated he was to testing and research in an effort to make his products the very best to serve his patients. I remember walking into his office one day and he had these large bandages on his face. I asked him what had happened, and he told me he was testing some products on his own skin. That's how passionate he was. Forever curious.I highly recommend this product, especially if you're frustrated with acne and feel there's no hope for you. There is. And you'll find it in Vivant products. I have had little red bumps on my thighs for decades. I recently read it was an actual condition and that this product treats it. 3 showers in and they're almost gone! Started to use it on my face and my skin looks better than ever. I'll be trying their other products I purchased this to replace a similar but proprietary product from my aesthetician, who is no longer in business.  I'm in my early 50's and I went to her for my hormonal adult acne problem and loved her products.  This face wash is almost identical and works just as well.  It's an amazing wash.  I use it twice a day and have no break outs whatsoever. I have had some form of acne my entire life (or at least as long as I remember). Recently, at ate 38, I started to experience acne that was different for me. It was more prevalent along my cheeks, jaw line and neck. They were deep under the skin and took WEEKS to heal only after removing the hard sebum plug. I immediately noticed a difference after starting with this cleanser. I did have to take a day off in between washings at the beginning or else it would drive out my skin but not after just a little over 2 weeks, I can use it daily without over-drying. I had mild purging for the first couple days but now those appear to have calmed down and I haven't noticed any new break-outs. My existing closed comedones appear to be coming to the surface quicker and drying up. The exfoliant makes my skin feel smooth and clean. This is the ONLY thing that's made this big of a difference in my skin. I am a believer and I will be looking to work more Vivant skin products into my regime. ONLY product that works for my keratosis problem! Amazing!!!! The only skincare products I use. I slept at a girlfriends house and my skin would always clear up the day after using her facewash so I tried it and haven't looked back since. I've tried La Mer, proactiv, murad, etc. and none work half as good at these do. I really loved using Vivant Skin Care's Mandelic Acid 3-in-1 Exfoliating Cleanser.  I had never heard of mandelic acid, so I'm thinking there are others who haven't heard of it either.Mandelic acid is an aromatic alpha hydroxy acid.  And, alpha hydroxy acids, of which the most common of which are glycolic acid and lactic acid, have been used for centuries for skin rejuvenation.  This mandelic acid cleanser contains exfoliating beads used to cleanse away dead skin.  It's a great product for oily and acne-prone skin.  It can be used to restore healthy skin on the face as well as the body.  It's also enriched with green tea extract, kiwi fruit extract, honey extract, and grape seed extract.This cleanser has a lovely gentle scent that doesn't smell like medication or chemical.  It's easy to use and great for men, women, or teens.  Anyone who is concerned about gently buffing away dead skin and cleaning problem skin will find a that they love this mandelic acid exfoliating cleanser as much as I do.I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. I use this product every once in a while, when I feel my skin is not as clean feeling as I'd like it to feel after washing it with soap. It exfoliates and helps make scars less noticeable. It has worked well for me"
B00GSSDHCG," This is a gentle face wash for all types of skin. I highly recommend it. Even for those with auto immune disease. (Do a skin test first) I have sensitive skin it did wonders for me! I absolutely love the bcBud product line, especially this facial cleanser.I am young guy who struggles with some stress pimples and dry skin all the time, and this stuff works amazingly well. It never dries out my skin, and after using it at least once daily it has helped keep my face clear of breakouts and leaves it feeling fresh, clean and noticeably healthier. These products are the real deal, and their organic claims feel authentic and not just an exaggerated selling point. I seriously cannot recommended this facial cleanser enough.Although a little does go a long way, I do wish this product had options for a larger bottle size, or if it came in a pump bottle. But otherwise, it's a rich, subtlety-scented lather that feels great on my skin and NEVER makes me feel dried out. The more I use it over time, the better my skin looks and feels. It is so worth the price and repeat purchasing as part of my daily routine for skincare. Recently I've developed a sensitivity to fatty alcohols (benzyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, etc.) I'm also sensitive to SLS. Trying to find a cleanser that contains neither of these was near impossible. I ran across this one while searching literally every single cleanser sold on Amazon. The price was much better than other cleansers suitable for my uppity skin, so I ordered it immediately. OH. MY. GOD. This stuff is fantastic! You only need a small amount to create a nice, creamy lather. It really cleanses the skin well, and rinses easily. My skin is left soft and smooth, never dry or flaky. The best part is that it absolutely doesn't make me break out or irritate my skin in any way. I hope that they never stop making this stuff, because I will be forced to buy cleansers that cost twice as much but work half as well. Love this facial cleanser. It has a creamy consistency and feels amazing! As someone else commented, it is not the best to remove make-up, so you do have to remove make-up prior to washing face but I don't mind at all. My face feels clean after using this cleanser. I have a combo oily/dry skin and have not had any issues or redness with this product. The bottle size is a bit small for the price but it is a natural product so just keep that in mind. gentle cleanser face feels clean I've tried so many different products to help my skin post-pregnancy, even the expensive department store brands.  Couldn't control my breakouts.  Went looking for a more natural approach and found this.  LOVE IT!  Breakouts almost eliminated, no over-drying, and my face just feels clean.  Highly recommend! I just purchased my second bottle of this. It's lightweight creamy and ever so slightly foamy so that your face feels clean not stripped. The sent is light and I overall love it. This product was just awesome it makes my face feel so healthy smooth and soft thanks will definitely buy more I have tried other products and they seem to dry out my skin even when they are not supposed to.  The facial cleanser works great, does not dry out my skin and even smells pretty nice.  I like hemp products and this one did not disappoint. Second time I've bought this. Works great for my 50+ year old skin. This face cleanser is very good for sensitive skin. I've been using this product for almost a year now and iI luv it!!! Just order my mother and I another bottle. denfinitely a 5 STAR!!! Love this cleanser! Leaves skin soft but not greasy; does a great job cleaning while moisturizing. A little drop goes a long way. Sometimes I add a drop of aveeno skin brightening daily scrub for a bit of exfoliation without drying. Good stuff; great value! This cleanser is the best. It cleans and softens my face. It smells nice too. Repeat order.  I like the way it cleans and feels on my face Great product!  A little goes a long way.  Ive been using this for several months and wanted to wait to give a review. It is gentle and does what it says. Love this product! My skin was a bit bla from winter and lack of sleep.  within one week, I was back to my glow. Priced well for amount received, really a great find. Love this facial cleanser..rinses off great, I use a BufPuf with mine and leave your skin soft and supple. Love that it natural and made from hemp.... This facial cleanser is great..doesn't dry my skin and the scent is wonderful. I plan to buy more once I'm ready. Very good product.  Gentle yet cleanses the skin very well.  My skin has improved since I started using it. Love this cleanser,it really helped with my dry skin. My favorite cleanser so far This face wash is amazing, no weird smell or residue. My skin feels extra soft and vibrant. Best face wash I've ever used. Ot did meet my expectations My wife loves this. feels amazing makes your skin glow! Good Product Best face wash I've ever used! I used to use the Boscia purifying cleanser, which also works well for me, but I think this one is even better. Gentle, refreshing smell, for a good clean feeling. My skin is pretty clear, but when I had sudden unusual breakouts (due to moving to a different climate) I tried several natural, gentle washes, and this one was perfect for me! Ordering my second bottle now! I feel like this product cleans without being too abrasive and leaves my skin so soft and clear.  Thanks for a great product and great service! My wife uses this facial cleanser and she loves it, much better than the cleanser from the body shop with tea tree oil. She has oily and sensitive skin. I was hesitant to introduce ANOTHER cleanser to my ever changing, skin of a 16 y/o pubescent boy, annoying FACE! I did a ton of research before accepting the discount in exchange of my honest testing a review of this wash. Here's what I found:DescriptionNatural formula with creamy texture and mild foaming action, gently washes away skin impurities without drying out your skinSoothes, tightens and brightens your skin with a blend of natural hemp oil, aloe vera, chamomile, cucumber and Japanese green tea extractCalms skin inflammation and irritation; prevents redness and breakouts with natural healing properties from the botanical extractsGentle on all skin types, effective for removing makeup, leaving no greasy, unpleasant residueMade in Canada with natural elements, paraben-free, alcohol-free, harsh chemicals-free, cruelty-freeBC Bud Hemp Brightening Facial Cleanser, Gentle for All Skin TypesThis unique natural facial cleanser gently but thoroughly whisks away the surface oils, make up, dirt and grime buildup from the day. Infused with a potent botanical blend, this facial cleanser works hard to hunt free radicals and calms redness, without drying out your skin.Specially formulated with hemp seed oil, which is known for its natural anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and emollient properties, this facial cleanser leaves your skin radiant, soft and smooth.The effort to achieve a clean, glowing and younger-looking complexion doesn't just stop there. We have also included aloe vera leaf juice and cucumber extract to soothe and tighten your skin, chamomile flower extract to calm irritation and redness, and our exclusive Moisturizing Complex, to nourish and hydrate your skin.A few dabs of BC Bud Hemp Brightening Facial Cleanser, a splash of water -- nothing can compare to the clean, refreshing, residue-free feeling on your face; and the firm, glowing, healthy complexion in your mirror!This is the exact product that we sell to high-end spas, and now you can use it in the comfort of your own home without paying spa prices!- Ingredients: No sulfates, no harsh chemicals. Compare our ingredients to your regular brand!- Scent: This product has a light, fresh green tea scent, made from natural ingredients.- Lather: This product may not lather as thickly as a store-bought product. Most products use sulfates (a detergent and irritant) to produce rich lather. Lather does not cleanse; it merely looks and feels good. This product will cleanse as well (or better) without excessive lather, and without irritation.My face feels great and more of what I feel like a 30 y/os face should feel! Very satisfied so far. We will see how it works over the next few weeks! Awesome cleanser! I have very sensitive skin, prone to being too dry after a wash. This cleanser comes in a pretty bottle, smells lovely, and is creamy white. You only need a little bit. It accomplishes something really simple, that other brands just can't seem to get right; It cleans your skin without irritating it. It's very gentle, and I don't even need to use a moisturizer afterwards. It reduces redness and flaking and breakouts. Love it. Big ups, BcBud. I have never tried a hemp seed oil product before so I really wanted to try this out. Upon arrival I was caught off guard with how small the bottle was. But in all fairness the description clearly says and shows a 4 oz bottle. But when using this product it only takes about a dime sized amount so it will last a while.It does have a very strong fragrance smell. I personally like it but those sensitive to strong scents may not be happy with this product. I would also like to note this product does have added fragrance other than the natural ingredients. It is clearly listed in the ingredients.The cleanser is a lotion like cleanser. It does not foam but that is to be expected and actually to me a positive. It rinses easily and for me it removed all traces of makeup. I would like to note I do not use long lasting or extended wear products that are offered by some companies so I am not sure what the results would be with those products. When I use toner afterwards I have zero traces of makeup left. Also this product is not near as drying as many facial cleanser I have tried and used in the past. In fact it is very comparable to a facial oil cleanser that I use often that works amazing for me. Shocker - I have combination acne prone skin and oil cleansing works amazingly for me. Back to the BCBud cleanser. This product has not caused any problems with break outs or caused skin to be excessively oily. Overall in my opinion this product is a good product and one that I will continue using in rotation with my oil cleanser. I did receive this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I am completely honest in every review because I myself look to reviews for input on making purchases. I review every product as if I paid full price. And if my opinion is changed after I post a review I do not hesitate to update and change my product rating."
B0164I75QS," Tea Tree Oil has been used for ages by Australian aborigines as a cure for many skin diseases including scabies.  I used this for redness, probably Rosacea, and it is very effective.  A skin mite called Demodex is known to cause Rosacea, and Tea Tree oil can kill Demodex.  I leave the lotion on my face for about two minutes before rinsing it off.  Watch this youtube video: ""Demodex killed by tea tree oil - Yong Ming Por"" and you will know why.P.S.  On my second order, I ordered three of this Facial Wash, but received 2 Facial Wash and 1 Toner instead.  The Facial Wash and Toner packaging look alike, but it is easy to make such a mistake.  Maybe they should redesign the Toner package to make it different from the Facial Wash. Really foams nicely, not over-drying, but naturally one requires a lotion afterward. The facewash makers have a lotion in this same line so I also purchased that with the toner. It smells really nice. Does a number on acne bacteria. I've been using this face wash for about a month now and I really love it. I have oily skin and hormonal/hereditary acne and while I can't say it has helped my acne (nothing has, I've just accepted that I'll grow out of it eventually), it leaves my skin feeling very soft and not totally stripped of oil. The scent is really nice, refreshing and clean. I just really love this face wash. My only complaint is that the top of the bottle has broken somehow and now doesn't go on straight, but there's no leakage or anything, so it's really not a big deal. So far it's the only thing that has helped dry up and prevent new breakouts for me!!! After 6 long frustrating months. I bought this for my teenage son and he just started using it. So my review so far only covers shipping (fast) and customer service which was excellent. However, I have high hopes as the product is made in Germany and I trust it won't disappoint. Love this product!! My face cleared up after a few weeks. I use the lotion too and they're great! I only need a tiny drop for this nice facial wash. This product arrived within 24 hours with Prime. So far I am very pleased with it. I have used tea tree oil from other companies but suspect I will stick with this brand because of the quality. I do recommend it . I freaking love this tea tree oil vegan face wash. It leaves my face feeling very clean. I do recommed using a moisturizer and various other products to see improvement but this is a good product and it has lasted for a while now. I will definitely will be repurchasing. Does exactly what it should. I like that it is cruelty-free and it works well without being drying. I'm using this facial wash for more then a year...and I just love it.. Will buy again. Washes face well fresh feeling and smell Fantastic product - I wish I had this as a teenager!! My esthetician recommended me a tea tree oil face wash for my acne-prone skin (mostly blackheads). I found this one and I absolutely love it! It works wonderfully and my skin is looking more beautiful than it has in a long time. After a life time of bad skin, this wqsh has been the best product I've used by far. And I promise this is an authentic review from a real user. But it NOW! The Germans got it right! This stuff is amazing my skin loves it. I have extremely sensitive skin tha'ts also acne prone this works great. I liked it a lot! It smells fresh, clean and it's soft for sensitive skin! Excellent product. Very smooth and doesn't have an over strong smell. Works great! The best! I'm very impressed by this face wash. I keep hearing how great tea tree oil is for your face, so I decided to buy a face wash and I came across this one. I love how it is vegan, paraben free, and cruelty free, and that it is imported from Germany. I've had other German items that I REALLY LOVED, so that was part of the deciding factor with this purchase to be honest. The packaging is very nice, and the bottle has a little pump to use the product. The smell is not very strong either, so that is a plus. It also removes my makeup, surprisingly. Even the eye makeup. Great product; great price, and I will be buying this again. I also bought the moisturizer, Tea Tree Oil Face Cream for Oily Blemished, Acne Treatment & Sensitive Skin Imported from Germany Infused with Pharmaceutical Grade Tea Tree Oil by Alkmene® so I'm excited to try that too. I have very sensitive skin with adult acne. I felt the difference of this product within one day. My face did not itch after washing it and the cream goes on very easily without leaving residue. EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!!! I LOVE IT! DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT 100%.you see the difference since the first use. Great I have both sensitive skin AND oily skin, and finding something that can minimize breakouts while not inflaming my skin or aggravating it is hard. Add to that, I wanted something cruelty free and vegan and my search is even harder. I have been using this product for about three weeks now and I LOVE IT.  I've had zero breakouts, even at that time of the month, when I almost ALWAYS have breakouts. My skin is noticeably clearer and softer and I love the way it smells. I like the way it makes my skin tingle when I'm washing my face - as if I were at the spa. Such a great price for this amazing product. I'll definitely be buying again and again. I bought this face wash along with the tea tree toner and the face cream/moisturizer of the same line. Hands down, the absolute best product line I have ever used in my life! I always cleanse my face with olive oil first to melt off any makeup and I remove with a wipe or cotton round. I use this as my second step to cleanse my face and this is the product that leaves my face feeling extra squeaky clean but not dried out. It's not extremely foamy and it feels almost like a watery gel when you first pump it out. This tea tree line really does draw out impurities deep in the skin. At first when I started using the 3 products, I started getting small white pimples on my cheeks and my nose. I couldn't believe that this was making me break out so I kept waiting and using it normally (twice a day) and after about 3-4 days the small pimples stopped. Additionally, I haven't had any occurrences of cystic acne in months which I would get one or two regularly and I also do not get blackheads like I used to. My face has never felt clearer! And my biggest pro about this brand is that a) I found a product extremely efficient without breaking the bank and b) its vegan and cruelty free! I could not be happier with my purchase and experience with Alkmene Tea Tree Oil product line! 0:330:00This video is not intended for all audiences.

It has a very nice scent - a combination of a floral and a minty scent.  I have been using it for 10 days so far and it cleans well without drying out my skin.I like the dispenser on the bottle.  It operates smoothly, the top is rounded so it feels nice under my finger, and the amount it dispenses is consistent from time to time.This face wash is made in Germany. It comes in 150ml bottle (which is about 5.07 fl oz).I received this face wash for testing and review. Getting a sample product does not effect what I say, as always I covered both pluses and minuses based on my personal experience: I like how my skin reacts to it and I like the scent.Ali Julia review I've been using this for about a week and have seen a HUGE change in my skin! My complexion is glowing. It makes my face feel really clean, which was a nice change from my old cleanser which just felt like it stayed on the surface of my skin. It smells like tea tree oil (as to be expected) and lathers really nicely. The product and packaging is great quality, and it's such an affordable cleanser. The first two days, it made my skin feel a little dry, but I do have dry skin anyways. I just make sure to moisturize, and it's fine! I use it twice a day with African Black Soap (from Raw Apothecary on Amazon!), Thayer's Witch Hazel and Rose Petal toner, and Pond's for dry skin. I wish I found this product sooner! I really love this face wash! It's probably the only one I've tried that doesn't leave my face feeling dry. I've only been using it since September so I don't see much results with my acne or oiliness in my skin yet but I'm super hopeful! I use usually one pump or two if I forgot to take my lip and eye makeup off the night before. The smell is also really nice too in my opinion. It's just really refreshing to use in the mornings. Hopefully will update when I run out of this stuff! This facial cleanser comes out like a clear gel, and it does not suds up at all, since it is made with all natural ingredients. It smells like tea tree oil, which is a plant-like smell. It does not linger on your skin after rinsing it off. It did not dry out my skin, but if feels clean.I like that this is a really affordable vegan skin care product, so I would recommend trying it out if you are vegan.I got this for free in exchange for my honest review. I have really sensitive skin and have been graced with perioral dermatitis in early adulthood. This is one of very few products that is gentle/non-drying but also effective. I also love that it's vegan and natural. I will keep using this! Did an insane amount of research for the perfect face wash and this one has been treating me well. It’s been 2 months of daily washing and it’s kept my hormonal acne at bay and it’s super gentle. Not harsh and drying but I do recommend adding a serum and a moisturizer after using. Good stuff! I loved that!! Amazing product! Perfect!"
B00NQ2K7B6," Love, love, love this stuff! I find myself turning to it again and again.When winter strikes or consecutive use of another product I've decided to try leaves my skin dry, I know it's time break out the Burt! This really is my go-to.It is a fairly thick, creamy cleanser. Unscented, too!It does not foam, but it leaves my skin clean and soft without overdrying it. I also like that it doesn't make my skin look shiny. I can just wash and go! No make up here other than some occasional foundation--my skin really is sensitive! So far this is the Best product I found on the market. I am so impressed with Burt's Bees Face Cleanser! My face feels so amazing during and after using this gentle cleanser. Thank you Burt''s Bees for selling this amazing product! Works good, feels like a mini massage on my face when I leave it on for a few minutes before I wash it off. Clean without drying the skin, washes off easily and leaves your skin feel smooth and clean. My favorite face wash, soft smell, and my skin feels amazing after cleaning it up. I use this cleanser (plus water) to remove my eye makeup. It has never irritated my eyes and doesn't leave any film on my contacts (I use night and day contacts i.e. I sleep in them). Cleanser also works great on irritated face (wind burn, sun burn, dry skin) since it is gentle and doesn't burn or cause additional inflammation. Great for my combination sensitive skin. My skins feels soft after using it, not tight and dry with most cleansers for combination skin that I use. I was afraid that it might not work well enough for my oily areas, but it does, and I haven't broken out since using it. It's cheaper buying it on Amazon than in local stores (if I can even find it in local stores, which is not easy.) Really like this. Gentle on my sensitive skin. No strong smell. No irritation. More good stuff from BB's! Not too strong or abrasive.  No fragrance or harsh chemicals.  Removes makeup and dirt without over drying. Makes my face very soft and cleans great! I have very sensitive skin, and face wash I've used in the past has given me very dry skin and left my face red and blotchy.  Ever since I started using this particular Burt's Bees Sensitive Face Wash I have had ZERO problems!!  So, I keep using it and keep my fingers crossed, but after about two years my face is still happy every day.  I am a very happy, repeat customer! (and when you have Amazon Prime, why not order the stuff online?!  I've seen plenty of pharmacies and drug stores that didn't stock this particular cleanser). love this product. gentle on my skin. Just right for my sensitive skin. I have had a challenging time with my skin (iOS and downs with fertility drugs) and have used various expensive products trying to find a solution. A friend recommended the Burt’s Bees Sensitive Skin line and it has made a dramatic difference in my skin. I would highly recommend this to anyone who struggles with skin issues. great for sensitive skin This is the good stuff. Love it so far gentle on my sensitive skin I love the texture and subtle smell of this face wash. It does a great job helping me feel clean and refreshed. I've started stocking up 3 or 4 bottles at a time. Highly recommend. This facewash is my favorite, I haven't used any other kind in a long time! I love this cleanser. It makes your face so soft and is so gentle. I use stronger cleansers for after makeup, but I continuously buy this especially for the mornings or anytime I want to treat myself. I really love it and it lasts a while. I have this on subscribe and save, and I've used it for years. Anyone with very sensitive skin should try this cleanser. It is not soap. It does not foam, and your skin will not feel squeaky clean. Your skin will be calm and unirritated, though. I love it. Great face cleanser. Definitely will buy again! I love this cleanser!  I have really sensitive skin and I've been using this cleanser for a few weeks without irritation! I like this cleanser because it doesn't feel like a soap, doesn't foam up like a typical cleanser, and leaves my skin moist. I'm 53 and I didn't want and don't need a cleanser that cleans deeply and might strip my face of moisture. The natural ingredients are an added bonus. good Best moisturizer there is. Period.  Non greasy and very effective. Burts bees skincare products are the first and only thing I have found (I've used tons) that works on my skin. I have very oily skin in some places and very dry skin in other places. Using the face wash then the moisturizer or toner sometimes keeps my skin so nice. Definitely recommend All others cause a reaction or dry me out. I sometimes forget to use moisturiser after washing! With all other washes i have to immediately put cream on and still feel dry. With this one it's perfect for dry winter months also. Is great for cleaning your face without over-drying. Is very pleasant and doesn't irritate your eyes if any gets in there. Seems to have basically no scent as well. This is an awesome facial cleanser! I use it just once every day. This is my creamy, lotion-esque cleanser that I start the day off with, while my second nighttime facial cleanser is a bit stronger to help remove the makeup from my face. Definitely recommend! Good for sensitive skin UPDATE:  I HAD A LIVE CHAT WITH CONNIE IN CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SHE FIXED THE PROBLEM RIGHT AWAT.  I COULDN'T ASK FOR BETTER OR NICER SERVICE.THIS IS UNUSABLE.  When I received it, it did not have the foil seal over the inner opening, and it smelled sour.  I'm afraid to use it, and I really want this product.  It looks like someone already opened it and smeared it around.  Now what do I do? What I like the most about this is that it cleanses without irritating , the tight dry feeling that you usually get with other kind of face cleansers it doest happen with this facial cleanser, it has no parfume or harsh chemicals, I like  it a lot, oit makes no foam, it' s lime a cream so it feels a little weird to wash your face  with something that doesn't feel ""soapy"" but it's well  worth it. I used to use Velocity by MK and it was okay but I wanted to try something more natural. Since using this product (and the moisturizing cream) my skin has felt so smooth, soft, and it looks great! It is a cream base so it does not lather like other facial cleansers but that is just something to get used to. It is a very gentle cleanser and has no scent. I love this product and highly recommend it! My skin is super sensitive and dry, yet I'm still able to use this wash daily without any negative effects.  I love how creamy it is and how it leaves my skin feeling soft, not tight.  This size bottle lasts for months! Rich and smooth; love it. great Been using this for years now... It's surprisingly difficult for people with sensitive skins to find stuff without all the added chemicals... Been my favorite for years because it doesn't dry out my skin like other face washes. I feel clean and moisturized when I'm finished. I have spent hundreds of dollars trying every facial wash out there, not thinking about BB's products, well, all I can say is, they guarntee their products, first time I used it, my face felt very soft, not like some facial washes, where you feel like a prune...help I need my moisturer.  This is awesome, I will be a return buyer, having sensitive skin can be very fustracting, but BB's products have won me...great  product..:):):) Very gentle cleanser for my face.  I use this after I use the Garnier Clean & Nourishing Cleansing Oil and they work beautifully together. I switched from the Collective Wellbeing cleanser to this one, and I love it. I have very sensitive skin, and I don't have any problems with this cleanser. It has basically no smell, which is great, and it's creamy enough. I hope they never change the formula!  Until then, I'm a loyal customer. I purchased this for my daughter who has dry skin and she loves it!!No added chemicals is the reason I love Burt's Bees Love this face wash as it doesn't make my face dry and face didn't break out after 2 weeks of use.  Wish it came in a pump bottle, but can't have everything.  Will buy again!! I use this face wash every day in the shower. It does not leave my skin dry. After trying multiple brands that leave my face overly dry or overly oily I discovered Burts bees and it definitely does the job. My absolute favorite face wash! I have very sensitive skin and am prone to getting peri-oral dermitis. This face wash is non-irritating and cleans great! Excellent product Product was as described and came quickly. I love this face wash - leaves me feeling clean without stripping my skin dry. I have breakout prone skin but this face wash has been great. Especially in the winter. It leaves my face feeling moisturized and helps to avoid a peeling nose. Love it. I usually use the deep cleanser which is a little thicker than this one but this work great too. I love the way it makes my face feel. Not as soft as a baby behind but with a fresh feeling of brand new. No redness or sticky feeling. Difficult to find a natural, gentle face wash at a reasonable price. This seems to be it! Creamy cleaner that didn't dry my skin or cause breakouts. My skin soaks up the moisture that I was hoping for. I will keep refilling my order. I have very sensitive skin and for years had been trying to find a cleanser that not only didn't make me break break out, but didn't break the bank. I first tried it as a BzzAgent in 2011 and have been hooked ever since. I like that this product is gentle enough for me to use every day and it doesn't dry out my face after washing. Most products make my face break out. This cleans off the extra oil and is gentle on my skin. I don't wear make up, so there isn't much that needs to be washed off.. but it works perfect for my needs. Very gentle and not soap-like, very moisturizing.  I alternate this with another cleanser that leaves my face feeling a bit ""cleaner."" The combo works well for me. My wife asked for this entire line as a gift and has been very happy with the results. I love this product for sensitive skin and it did not make me break out. Package arrived cracked open but seller is working to refund my money and it seems simple! I will still buy this product at the store! When I stick to a regular routine of burts bees face products my skin looks and feels great. The Bees Knees! This wash is so gentle but cleanses very well. Nothing makes my skin softer and more hydrated than this! I love it! Burt's Bees Sensitive Skin Facial  cleanser . The face wash that I used before I can't fine. I like the Burt's Bees facial cleanser . I also have there lip blam and I like it to. One of my favorite Burts Products! Great for sensitive skin! Found this on Amazon at a great price. Since I was buying the body wash which I can't get in my local CVS or Whole Foods any longer, I stocked up on both products.  Great product too, no harsh chemicals, nothing bad in it. Highly recommend this product. This is by far the best facial cleanser I've ever tried.  My face isn't tried out and it feel clean and moisturized after, even before I put on lotion.  I'll be a user of this cleanser for life. This is my favorite skin cleanser. It cleans my face without leaving it dry. I use this every night and no sensitivity to it. Great product! I love this cleanser, I was using a much more expensive cleanser before this and it was working but the price was really bothering me for something I am rinsing down the drain.  I use a clarisonic and I have dry/ combination skin very dry skin on my forhead and cheeks and large congested pores on my nose. I really wanted a soap free cleanser because I just love how my skin feels without using soap. I do however have a deeper cleanser I use about once a week before I use a face mask just to ensure I get any residue off my face and im starting fresh.*scent- it is fragrance free which means no added fragrance the natural scent of this product isnt great but it isnt bad at all and it is very comforting to me for some reason. It isnt strong and it does not linger once you rinse it off you are good!*cleansing ability- this cleans great without leaving your skin tight or dry. I use this in the morning with just my hands to wash off my night treatments and I love how soft my skin is after. I have another cleanser Im using up at night , however when I do use this at night it works Great with my clarisonic to give me a deeper clean. I use the burts bees makeup remover wipes first if I have makeup on.*overall- it is a great soap free cleanser. Does not irritate my skin, I am absolutely in love with it! Will repurchase again and again! Also It helped clear up some tiny bumps I was getting on my forhead! Been using this cleaner for years now. I started when I got pregnant with my first.  It's great on sensitive skin and it takes my make-up off fairly decent. My face loves this cleanser. It's very gentle and softening. I use it as a mask in the tub and it feels hydrating and clean. My fav cleanser for years now. I really like this product,  I have ultra sensitive skin and so far no issues. It is so soft and smooth, give it a try, big tube for a little price. This stuff was amazing, left my skin feeling clean but not dryed out at all! Item was as described and expected. The best face-cleanser. My wife loves this, so we will continue to buy it from Amazon. I have sensitive skin and this cleans my face without irritation. My favorite cleanser ever.  Face feels so good afterward, and I love that it's natural without any chemicals on my face and truly unscented.  Good price too.  Cheaper than brick and mortar stores. Great for my sensitive skin. Didn't cause burning or irritation. Wonderful creamy cleanser for sensitive skin!  My daughter and I both use it daily and love it! This facial cleanser is so great! If you have sensitive skin this product is a definite must have. good Good for sensitive skin, fair price for quality of product. Good for people looking for gentle cleanser this is not a deep cleaner but good for me twice a day Feels great going on; does a good job; leaves skin soft. My teenage daughter has a blemish problem and this product works really well and we like that it all natural. Great for my sensitive skin. I have been using it for years. I love Burt's Bees products! My friend recommended this to me. Then I ordered five. I tried this. Really good!  Keep my face wet all the time. A little background: My skin is oily, milk chocolate colored, and not sensitive.I've been using this stuff for about a week and have no complaints thus far. This stuff has a creamy texture and does not lather, so it feels like washing my face with lotion. Not a thick Eucerin-type lotion, but more like a Curel/Jergins-type one. So be sure to rinse it off entirely.This stuff is also a darn good makeup remover---and I'm talking removes coal-black eyeliner and mascara, red lipstick, and medium-darkish makeup no problem good. It does that all without ""grinding"" my skin, leaving it dry or oily, or irritating it. This stuff removes oil from my skin without making it dry, so it's good for oily skin. And because it does not ""strip"" oil, and in fact has moisturiser in it (the rice extract, I believe), it should be good for dry skin, too. But I can't say. I don't feel like I ""need"" to wear moisturiser anymore, but I can't speak from the point-of-view of someone who has extremely dry skin. Oh, and well, it's no longer winter, so that surely factors into it too.Let's see... I use the cotton/rise extract one and it doesn't have a scent beyond a default lotiony scent, so it's definitely not something that will run you out of the bathroom. That's all I can think of right now.Overall, I recommend this for anyone who desires what it is advertised to be: a nonfancy gentle cleanser that gets the job done. Finally a product that is fragrance free works. It is the best product for sensitive skin Treat the more expensive products and none worked for me great moisturizing face wash works wonders on sensitive skin Works very well for my aging skin. My face feels smooth and clean, but not dry after use. Works great Wish it would suds up a little. Definitely provides moisture to my skin. I love the Burt's Bees products.  I have sensitive skin issues and this doesn't irritate at all.  It is the only thing I wash my face with. I have very dry skin and have used Burt's products for several years now.  This facial cleanser does a great job, does not dry out my skin but also is not oily. Great for sensitive skin. Works really well for me and my face is really sensitive. I first used this cleanser when my 26 year old daughter brought it home with her when she came for a visit.  I love it mostly because it is fragrance free (I get migraines), and does a great job of cleaning my face. It is a great cleanser for the sensitive skin. Love all the Burt's Bee products and this was no exception. I just love this it's great for sensitive face use cleans your face very well Very mild cleanser. Definitely feels different! Works and smells great! I use for night time because it smells so soft and lovely. I am allergic to most face washes, but not this one. I have sensitive skin that is prone to be oily. This lotion is simply wonderful. I feel confident using this knowing it is such a natural product. My face is soft and even without extra oil.Thank you. Love the scent and the clean, cool, refreshing feeling it gives my skin. Good and supposedly good for you - without those dangerous additives.Cleans, washes off easily.  No unpleasant odor. my daughter loves it All expectations were met. Good product. Is very relaxed, very comfortable. This doesn't dry out my skin (which is a miracle for me) and it's nice and gentle going on. Definitely a keeper. Love this stuff, makes my face so clear and smooth. very good This Burt's Bee Sensitive Skin Cleanser is great you only need a little, but you feel the softness right away.I have extremely sensitive, dry flaky skin and this works for me. Love how it cleans without drying out your face! Bonus all natural products! Awesome face wash for sensitive skin to control acne, best product I have ever used. Love this stuff for my sensitive skin, lasts awhile too. Good its perfect for washing face, use few times a week, love it, very good product, ordered many times love it Got for daughter she loves it Excellent product. I like this product, good brand and almost all natural just as expected Good cleanser, use the back portion do not feel greasy, stick with hope to have better results, make my skin look healthier I have over four months using this product and my skin looks and feels amazing. I think it balances your skin naturally. G I first cleanse with a more aggressive cleanser since I'm out in the polluted elements so much.  Then finish w/ this product which leaves skin cottony soft :) Sure cleans and moisturizes I have incredibly sensitive skin. I either break out, dry out, or simply turn bright red depending on the additives in the skin care products that I use on my face. This sensitive facial cleanser does not cause me any harm. I can wash my face in both the morning and evening without any problems. My face does not get irritated so I don't end up with red, splotchy, and peeling skin. The reason this Burt's Bees face wash works so well for me is that there are no added colors or scents. Even without added any fragrance, it still has a pleasant aroma. It is made out of cotton, rice, and aloe, and has a mild smell that I really like. It is almost entirely natural; the package says it's made of 99% natural  materials. It is a cleanser, not a soap, that is hypoallergenic and noncomedogenic. My dermatologist recommended that I find a cleanser rather than a soap to keep my face from drying out. The package says it is dermatologist tested. I also love that the company does not test on animals. All in all, this is my favorite face wash because it is gentle, natural, and works well on my sensitive skin. Love this face wash - leaves my face feeling clean, and even though it is super creamy, it does not feel oily at all. It's a big one (I'm female writing on my husband's account.) I have dry, very, very sensitive skin. I'm blessed to not suffer from much acne (besides the occasional ""monthly"" bump or two) but most facial cleansers are either too harsh, or actually nice to my skin but don't seem to really clean them. I must say, I bought this thinking it might be too weak to take off the mascara I wear, but it removes it better than the St Ives Apricot Scrub I was using! I also no longer get out of the shower with red, irritated cheeks.I think my real problem was that I didn't want to give up that great ""scrub"" feeling that the other cleansers like St Ives have, with the actual exfoliating beads...but I finally came to terms with the fact that I NEED a gentler, creamier cleanser. And this is it! I definitely recommend it =). I love Burts Bees and this online deal was way cheaper than the prices at stores so I am glad that I found this deal. a little dry after washing face The product is in perfect conditions. Thanks to the provider, all is ok. I recommend and i save to my favorites. foaming free I really like this facial cleanser since I have very low maintenece skin, but if I do get a breakout, I revert back my good ol' Witch Hazel. This kind of feels like your applying a cool cream, but has more of a lotion feel and not the typical cool, clean and refreshing feeling when you rinse it off. My boyfriend doesn't like it do to the mediocore clean feeling, but for me, the chemical free ingredients make it 5 stars in my book!! I have used a well know brand of cosmetics for many years with no problems to my sensitive skin.After the founder/owner passed and her family begin managing the business many of the older products were discounted.I tried multiple popular brands of cleanser and was unable to use them due to skin being irritated.So I bite the bullet once again and gave Burt's Bee' cleanser a try. I am now using my second tube so that tells you there are no problems with this product and my skin. This is the only natural face wash without a bunch of nasty chemicals I can find that is also non pore-clogging. I have acne, and very delicate skin from all the stupid medications I'm on and this face wash works very well and is very gentle. It feels very nice when you use it, and I never feel a residue when I'm done with it, I also don't feel all dry and taught which can happen with a lot of other products. Highly recommend! Cleans your skin while not drying out. Even though I have adult acne, I discovered that most comparably priced ""acne fighting"" face washes dried out my skin and made the problem worse. This product isn't directly targeting acne, but since it doesn't dry out my skin, the acne situation has improved. Love Burt's Bees products! I never write reviews on products ever, but I had to write one after using this product.  I have dry oily combo skin with mild acne once in a while and this cleanser is by far the best I have ever tried and I have tried literally like 100 different cleansers.  My skin was sooo dry from the cold weather and I tried thousand different moisturizers thinking that was the issue, but one day I came across this and thought I would give it a try.  After the first use, my skin was not dry or tight not one bit!!!  After about a weak my skin was still moisturized and I needed only very little moisturizer on my face and some days I wouldnt use any!!!  I can remember the last time I did not use lotion on my face before using this facewash.  My skin tone has evened out dramatically, my skin looks and feels smooth.  I get sooo many compliments on my skin now and since using this facewash I have not had one pimple!!! Seriously, not one!!  Also, my skin has barely been oily and it stays free of oil all day!! I have stocked up on this facewash in hopes that it never is discontinued.  If you have not tried it do it.  Give it a week or two and you will see awesome results.  People complain about the texture, but its what dry skin needs!! A non lathering cream that does not strip your skin and this facewash definitely does not clog pores!!!!  This is by far the best cleanser I have ever tried and I used to be addicted to foaming/gel cleansers for that squeaky clean feeling, but all that did was make my skin dry and break me out....so try this and you will not be sorry!!! I break out very easily.  I have tried SO MANY cleansers including the more expensive kinds.  This is the only one that leaves my face smooth and happy.  I also like that there are no parabens in the product.  If you have sensitive and/or combination skin, give this a try. Finally, a facial cleanser that I am happy with!  This cleanser works well on my combination skin - it cleans without drying me out or making my face overly oily.  It has a nice creamy feel and rinses easily. This is the first time in a long time that I have bought the same facial cleanser twice in a row.  I added it to our Subscribe and Save. This is a nice creamy cleanser which gets my face really clean without drying or irritation.  Even though it is creamy, it rinses off very well, no residue seems to be left behind. I definitely recommend this product if you are looking for a gentle cleanser. Awesome product. I like that it is fragrance free. Cleanses well without overdrying. I'm also prone to breakouts, but my skin has cleared up nicely since switching to this product. I have tried the black tea mash from fresh I loved it so much but the price is too much, this one's feeling texture and smell almost same as it, but price only 1/10 The Burt's Bees Sensitive facial cleanser is an excellent product that delivers.ABOUT: According to the packaging, this product is in the ""Sensitive"" skincare line and offers a ""natural skin solution"" that ""moisturizes without causing redness or irritation"". It is also ""soap-free, fragrance-free, and hypo-allergenic"". The bottle boasts the ability to ""soften, moisturize, and soothe"".REVIEW: I decided to review this product because I am disappointed in the current reviews.  Too many times have people mentioned that they would rate this higher if it offered anti-acne medication and/or some type of aging-deterrent. People! Why not review the product for how it performs with the actual claims on the bottle? Specifically - soften, moisturize, and soothe.  I have been using this product for three weeks now. I have acne-prone skin that is very sensitive because of several topical medications that I am on which address this acne-prone skin. For me, the ""holy grail"" of facial cleansers is a product that is gentle enough to not irritate my skin, but still effective as a cleansing agent. Does not cause break-outs. Oh, yeah - and please add a moisturizing component and an aesthetic experience. With these requirements, let's just say I've been around the block a few times with cleansers - from department stores (Clinique) to drug stores (everything!).  This cleanser is the best that I have used! I love the creamy consistency, which gently removes makeup, dirt, grime, and grease while still leaving my skin feeling moisturized. It does not form a gross suds-ball because it isn't full of unnecessary and irritating surfactants/detergents. It doesn't cause breakouts, and while unscented, it has a very faint ""toasted rice"" scent to it, which may be the Rice extract. I noticed that a few reviewers commented on the ""film"" that it left on their face - honey, those are your natural oils! I agree that I also felt a little ""filmy"" after I first used it, but by the next wash that sensation went away - replaced by a thrill of not having to rush for my moisturizer within 30 seconds to replace all the oils I just stripped away. It's quite nice!  In summary, this facial cleanser delivers. If you are looking for an anti-aging or anti-acne cleanser, this is NOT it. If you are looking for a cleanser that will clean and moisturize your sensitive skin, I don't know that you will find a better product than this one. By the way, it's 99.0% natural - that's pretty great, too! Since started using this product, my skin is seriously improved. Turns out soap makes me break-out, so I'm now a soap-free gal. My wife and I use this daily. Cleans gently without any sting, and with no fragrance. We think it's great. Purchased this locally to give it a try. Now will not use anything else always have 1 in reserve in case I run out No heavy smell, rinses off quickly, no residue.  Does not leave my skin dry. This has helped clear up breakouts quite well. This is the only cleanser that really works for my face, and I'm glad I was able to use it during my pregnancy. Bought for girlfriend, works awesome, way cheaper than in store!Watch the netflix documentary. I have incredibly sensitive combination skin on the face (oily in some spots, dry in others), and my husband has normal oily skin. This product did wonders for both of us surprisingly. It was able to moisturize my dry spots and help reduce the oil on the oily parts.I love that Burt's Bees is made in America, and not tested on animals.I love this face wash, i love this brand. It was great trying this product Best cash wash for super sensitive skin nice good deal . will buy again love it nice Great stuff!  Gently removes make up and smells delicious too.  It is a little aromatherapy snuck into your routine.  I enjoy it!  Leaves skin clean but not dry. All my life I've struggled with combination acne-prone skin.  I've tried lots of products that worked, but only temporarily.  I loved this fragrance free sensitive skin product from Burt's Bees from the first use; however, I wanted to wait to use it for a full month before reviewing.  After a month, I can truly say I can't imagine changing to any other product.  My acne is under control. My oily skin is much more under control.  Even more amazing, I think my skin looks more beautiful without make-up now!  I've been using it in combination with their sensitive skin night cream (using day and night).  Their day cream wasn't moisturizing enough for me and left my skin feeling irritated, but once I exchanged it for the night cream, my life was changed!  I did have one break-out during my most hormonal time of the month, but it was nothing compared to usual (or compared to what happened to my back and shoulders).  I also love the equivalent eye cream and am now looking into buying more of their fragrance-free products for the rest of my body! Wonderful for dry/sensitive skin. I struggle with breakouts and skin generally and this cream cleanser has been a welcome update to my skincare routine. I used to have terrible flakey skin, a mix of blackheads and spots and overactive sebaceous filaments. Approaching 30, my skin FINALLY looks like a normal person's after ditching expensive/chemical products and using the following: Burt's Sensitive Facial Cleanser (for make-up removal/general cleansing), Thayer's Rose Petal Witch Hazel toner w/aloe (morning and night) and LT Organic's virgin Argan Oil mixed with a few drops of pure lavender oil (morning and night). I am slowly weeding out harsh and toxic body products. Last month I chose to get a safe facial cleanser. because it is so smooth and creamy, i thought for sure I would break out! I have not reacted negatively to this (I usually always break out when i switch face wash), and it leave me feeling moisturized, rather than feeling like all my natural oils have been harshly stripped away. Smells great. But what Burts Bees product doesn't! I have very sensitive, acne-prone skin; I suffer from psoriasis on my scalp and elbows, and have always had issues with finding facial cleansers that don't aggravate my skin.  So far, this product fits the bill!  It's a very non-abrasive cleanser, with a very thick consistency; a small amount goes a long way.  So far, it has left my skin calm and reduces quite a bit of the redness. I have ezcema and extremely sensitive skin. Most ""sensitive"" products irritate my skin but this cleanser is a gem! As some other reviews state it is really thick and moisturizing but that's the beauty of it. I would recommend using a small amount as a little goes a long way. I do not use makeup (really sensitive skin, remember?) so I have no idea how well this removes makeup. ButIf you have sensitive skin this cleanser is for you. This leaves my skin feeling cool so that if I use it right after mowing the lawn it's immediately cooling and soothing. I never find a need to use a moisturizer after using this cleanser so I have not tried the one in this line. I seriously cannot state how amazing this cleanser is and I HIGHLY recommend it. Apparently all along I have had sensitive skin. I always attributed my break outs to not having a strong enough cleanser. I was wrong. Once I started using the entire “sensitive” regimen, my skin is so much healthier. This face cleanser is thick and does not produce a lot of suds, but it does a great job removing makeup (along with my Norwex baby cloth!). I wear a moderate amount of make up daily and once I’m done I can follow up with Witch Hazel and the pad always comes out clean. Which means it is removing all of my makeup!After using the 4 “sensitive” products combined (face cleanser, eye cream, night cream and daily moisturizer), my skin has changed. My skin looks healthier, I don’t have as many breakouts and I no longer deal with dry peeling skin.I waited 2 months before writing this review so I could really test out this product. It is really amazing what it has done for my skin! I would recommend buying all 4 of these items together. After 2 months of using these products, I’m not even close to running out. It’s affordable, natural and lasts a long time. I used the entire tube of ""Burt's Bees Natural Acne Solutions"" with a clean face cloth every day for about 2 months and it did not help clear or reduce the acne at all. I noticed that sometimes after I used it, the acne became more red and was probably irritated. The ""Natural Acne Solutions"" should definitely not be used with someone who has sensitive skin.I used the ""Burt's Bees Sensitive Facial Cleanser (wash)"" that does not claim to prevent or treat acne (3 times a day), including every time before I used the ""Burt's Bees Natural Acne Solutions"" (that I used only once a day).After I discontinued using the ""Natural Acne Solution,"" I continued to use only the ""Sensitive Facial Cleanser"" 3 times a day and I noticed that after months of unsuccessfully trying to reduce the size and amount of acne on my face, that it finally began to improve. I think that if someone has very sensitive skin, probably the first thing they should try is using ONLY a type of ""Sensitive Facial Cleanser"" frequently (2 to 3 times a day), for at least a month and seeing if there is any improvement, before trying to additionally use any specific acne medication or treatment (because if the acne medication or treatment causes irritation, it can potentially make the acne worse.)I would definitely recommend the ""Burt's Bees Sensitive Facial Cleaner"" and believe that using it is more beneficial than the ""Natural Acne Solutions"" if the person has sensitive skin. I use this as a body wash on the most sensitive areas (I'll leave that up to your imagination!). I works great and does not irritate my skin, nor does it leave a greasy residue. I would recommend it as a face wash if you have very dry skin, but it is not strong enough to remove heavy makeup.This product has no noticeable smell and the texture is very nice and creamy. If it doesn't make me break out or itch then anyone can use it.  My most favorite for years.  Tried other stuff and then just gave up why bother when this works so great. My new official face wash! I have crazy sensitive skin. Anything oily or lots of fragrance I break out. Anything that's exfoliating kills my skin. Anything else dries my skin out so bad it feels like it's cracking. This doesn't do any of that. It's a nice creamy consistency. Takes off left over make up and gentle on the skin. Even after washing it off my face felt clean and hydrated. For normal skin you prob wouldn't even have to use a moisturizer after. I followed up with the sensitive skin facial moisturizer and my face has never felt or looked better. Being more natural must be really helping my skin. Plus for the low cost compared to buying any other vegan or natural products. Highly recommend! I have sensitive, cystic acne prone, combination skin, leaning towards oily for the most part. I've tried so many different name brand facial washes and plain bar soaps, but everything irritated my skin or made it overly dry in some places. I decided to try this and am so pleased with it. It's creamy like lotion, but I feel that it washes off easily and my skin feels so smooth and clean afterward and doesn't make me break out. It has cleared up my dry areas as well. I don't wear makeup, so I can't say how it would work for that, but if you have sensitive skin, I'd definitely recommend this product. I normally don't write reviews but I must share how great this product is!I have seriously dry, sensitive skin that is easily irritated by fragrances, dyes, benzoyl peroxide / salicylic acid, etc. so all of my skin care must be cream based to help keep my skin moisturized.  For years I used St. Ives Makeup Remover and Facial Cleanser and when the company discontinued the product in 2010 I made it my mission to buy every available tube of cleanser left on store shelves.  Well, I final used my last tube in January 2015 and I've been back on the hunt for a facial cleanser that would suit my needs.I've used Aveeno, Simple skin care, First Aid Beauty, Ambi, Neutrogena, etc. and they all strip my skin and caused breakouts.  Then, just before I gave up and committed myself to Cetaphil I happened upon Burt's Bees and I'm sooooo thankful that I did! This product is gentle on the skin, super rich and creamy, perfume free, soap-free, no dyes, contains natural ingredients, and it doesn't irritate the skin.  I love that it doesn't lather or contain menthol like many other products that have acne or bacteria fighting properties.  This is a simple, moisturizing facial cream that will remove light makeup and cleanse your skin without leaving it striped and begging for moisture.If you have dry skin and are frustrated in your search for a simple, gentle, cream cleanser to soothe your dry, easily irritated skin THIS IS IT!UPDATE:I used this product for about 2-3 weeks and then my skin became irritated and I had breakouts all over my cheeks + chin.  Sorry, Burt's Bees, this one's just not for me after all. This is an incredible face wash for anyone with sensitive skin. It's not drying at all, but your face also feels clean afterwards.  One of two facial cleansers I've ever used (and I've used many) that didn't dry my face out after using it. I highly recommend this to anyone with dry/combination skin. Pair it with the moisturizer and you're set! I have sensitive combination skin. This stuff feels and smells like a dream. It smells like sheets on a massage table. It's like visiting the spa every time I wash my face.  It's thick and creamy, but rinses clean. I've got my mom using it, too, and she says it has helped her rosacia. This cleanser is incredible if you have dry sensitive skin! I gave up on cleansers almost 3 years ago just before my 30th birthday because nothing worked well for me. Every cleanser i tried (and there have been sooo many over the years) either broke me out or dried me out- even the ones that claim to be moisturising . I gave up on them totally opting to use only a micellar water to remove make up and rinsing with water. I decided to try this cleanser recently to use with my new Solo Mio sonic face brush. The combination of using the 2 together has completely changed my skin! My skin is softer, brighter and hydrated! My skin actually feels refreshed and clean instead of tight and stripped. I have had no issues with rinsing this stuff off my skin at all but i only use a dime size amount.  Also, i think it's wise to remove your makeup prior to cleansing to make sure your skin gets really clean (but I would recommend that with any cleanserl. I have struggled with adult acne for years and after I had a baby it got much worse. I tried everything to clear it up. I read about oil cleansing so I thought I would try this because its oil based. It is amazing! It leaves my skin soft and smooth and I rarely ever get a pimple anymore. I use this and then slather a couple drops of argan oil. My skin has never looked better. Super gentle, but still gets my skin super clean. I've almost exclusively used cleansers made for fighting acne, but I decided to switch to a more basic cleanser, and it is the best thing I've done for my skin. If you're using other cleansers and they haven't worked for your skin (or have been overdrying or irritating), I highly recommend this. I use this product everyday. My skin is extremely sensitive. I use this with an electric facial cleansing brush. It works very well. My skin does not get red or break out. I'm so glad I found this face wash. After many years of upset skin, I finally have found a safe, reliable, mild cleanser that does the job. I wash my face with this cleanser morning and night and I've had long term skin problems clear up. I'm 62. My daughter is 25 and she says it has cleared her skin too! I don't understand it...I've tried everything but this stuff works.My skin combination dry/somewhat oily/extremely sensitive and itchy. Amazing. Give it two weeks. Okay honestly i never post reviews on anything i buy. This product is the best thing i have ever come into contact with! I'm 21 years old and i have had acne since i was 14. I have always felt so ugly because of my genes. So many people use to make fun of me when i was in school and it completly made me hate myself. I pretty much dont have a social life because of my self confidence. I have been researching for awhile now about different products to use, oils, ANYTHING to get rid of my breakouts. When i came accross this beautiful product i used it for one day and already saw results. I also use the moisturizer cream too. My skin has never looked better before and i feel so much happier! I can acctually take pictures of myself and feel pretty, never felt that before. This cleanser has worked wonders for me in such a short amount of time. If you have sensitive acne-prone skin, give this a try! You wont regret it i promise. Love this face wash! I have major allergies to most soap ingredients but not this one! Its the only one I've ever tried that has NOT caused me to break out with a rash. Its wonderful! My old facial wash got too spendy so here I am. Usually not too into this brand but I decided to give it a go and WOW so happy! My skin is sensitive, prone to redness, and terribly dry despite living in a temperate/wet climate (WA state). And all that dryness makes my skin break out! Horrible cycle to try and break! Cream cleansers are my favourite because without the soapy lather it actually moisturizes and doesn't leave my skin with that weird tight/dry thing. THIS IS ESPECIALLY AMAZING and I have been getting compliments on my skin lately. I also use a toner but I do believe this wash is at least 50% why my skin is not dry, flaking, red and horrible. Again, for me, dryness is the biggest reason for my acne and treating dryness means my zits go away! USE THIS IF YOU ARE DRY! YOU WILL LOVE IT! The best. I am starting to become addicted to Burts Bees. I love the honey face wash but I decided try this one because it is a little less expensive. DOES NOT DISAPPOINT. I wasn't sure if I would feel as clean as when you use stuff with microbeads or salt in it. My face felt clean and refreshed. I was kind of skeptical of this but I’ve only used it for 4 days now, but my acne is basically gone now and it’s been slowly getting worse over the past few months! It even helps prevent acne it seems, even if you occasionally forget to take your makeup off before bed! I’m seriously sticking with Burt’s Bees face products from now on! I love this cleanser it removes all my makeup including eye makeup (without any burning or stinging) easily.  This product is perfect for sensitive skin. After I turned 30, my skin got a little on the dry and imbalanced, and this is gentle and works well for me without feeling heavy I have sensitive skin that is also oily so I need to wash my face before bed. I've been using this for a few weeks and it works very well. You simply apply some of the cream all over your face, avoiding the eye area. Then you simply wipe it off with a warm washcloth. I follow with a toner and anti aging cream. So far I've noticed that my skin is clearer. I'll continue buying this as it soothes the skin and gives a good deep clean.~The Rebecca Review I have very sensitive skin, and this is the only face wash I can use that doesn't make me turn red or even break out later. I will never use any other face wash. I love this kind and have been using it for years. FINALLY! I found the one face cleanser that doesn't make my face freak out! I live in Phoenix, AZ and I have hypothyroidism so the skin on my face gets so dry it flakes and cracks and is just constantly red. Some soaps makes my face feel like it's on fire and then I look like I got a chemical peal for hrs. For the first time since I was a teenager I washed my face last night and was too lazy to put a moisturizer on. Which I couldn't even do before. I woke up this morning and I actually have soft naturally moisturized skin! Honestly I could cry I'm so happy. This product works really well for me. It's not too harsh on my skin, so it doesn't dry it all up. It clears away all the oil/dirt on my skin at the end of the day, and in the morning it doesn't exfoliate my face raw (like so many other face wash products!). It's great if you're skin is sensitive. I use a powder foundation and so many other face wash products dry up my skin so much that I am unable to use makeup. It also has a subtle but nice fresh, clean scent due to the ingredients used. I also love knowing that the product is eco-friendly and also not animal tested. I would highly recommend this. This is my second purchase of this facial cleanser.  It smell very sweet and flowery.  The texture is absolutely marvelous.  It glides on your face.  It makes your face feel like it is enmeshed in a floral arrangement.  Soft and extremely smooth like a luxurious cream. I bought this product recently and at first I was very skeptical. I had read other reviews online (on another website I think) and they were about 50/50. Either you loved it or hated it. Since using this (glad I got it) I've been extremely pleased with what I'm seeing that I felt so compelled to come back online and write my own review!I'm pregnant right now and there's a lot of facial cleansers I can't use anymore, including the products I had before I was pregnant. But since I bought Burt's Bee's Sensitive facial cleanser with cotton extract, my skin has never looked so good! I swear it's actually improving! I'm the kind of person who can't feel comfortable or confident stepping outside without a ton of makeup to cover up my acne, my uneven skin tone, and all the redness and irritation. But now it's like I have a new face, lol! I might even go out sans makeup for the first time in... well, forever. The redness and irritation I've always had is gone. My oily-ness is under control. My acne has definitely subsided so much that my skin looks clear. Even my skin tone somehow looks uniform and glowing. This stuff is awesome! When it comes to facial cleansers, I've just about used it all. Some stuff works just okay, other stuff is really harsh and damaging to my skin. But this doesn't further irritate my skin, it doesn't make it even redder after using it, it doesn't burn, it doesn't itch, it doesn't dry me out or make my skin even oily-er, and it actually visibly works. It's not like some fairy tale I'm believing in, telling myself that it's working. It's actually working and I can visibly see the results! I've never had skin like this before. It looks healthy! Even the small blackheads on my chin have gone away and the pores are diminishing (something no other product has been able to do before). The first time I used this I had been getting a small pimple on the worst spot of my face- on the tip of my nose. After I used it that first night, by the morning the pimple was completely gone already with no irritation left behind. I'm amazed at how healthy my skin is now. Lol, have I said that enough? I also love that my skin feels moisturized and soft throughout the entire day.Be aware of how much you squeeze out because it does tend to come out fast. The cleanser is very much like a cream. It doesn't lather up like others do, but that's okay if it works. It has a very clean, subtle smell (kind of like cotton). Some people may not like the smell because it's not what they're used to, but it's not stinky or overpowering. On the reviews I saw before I bought this, a lot of women were complaining that it wasn't able to wash off their makeup. I don't know what type of makeup they're using, but it's been up to the task for me and does remove it. But now I may not even need to wear makeup anymore (that would be awesome!). The cleanser is very thick. I splash water on my face before I apply to help with that. I gently rub it into my face in small circles and leave it on for maybe a minute without touching it, before applying more water and gently rubbing it further in. Because it is very thick it takes the help of a cloth to rinse it off. I don't scrub at my face more when I do this. I kind of splash water onto my face with it and gently dab and wipe away. Works just fine to rinse it off.So all in all, I am very pleased with this product! My skin looks healthy and for me that's a big deal. :) When I finally stopped using harsh products on my skin and switched to this mt adult acne cleared up. Once in a while.I have some black heads or a pimple but its rare and my awful.cystic acne is GONE. Ive been using it for over a year and I highly recommend it, as far as people who said it wouldnt take their makeup off... Id use a makeup remover or some olive oil or coconut oil to remove their makeup and then wash with this. I dont wear makeup regularly but when I do thats what I do.  Ive used a lot of different face washes on the market and none of them really take makeup off, and if it does its probably way harsh for your skin. Just my two cents. I love this product personally, and its the only thing that has worked for my combination skin. I was looking to get the 'Intense Hydration Cream Cleanser' to replace my 'Orange Essence Cleanser' the latter of which I ran out of and found to be too drying for repurchase. However the store was out of the Intense Hydration, so I picked this up instead.I have to say I'm really happy with my purchase! This product is soft and creamy and isn't a soap (Which I'm fond of in cleansers) it smells kind of creamy and grassy, I was worried it wasn't going to do a good job of make-up removal, but I was proven wrong, it does an excellent job of removing makeup without drying or irritating my skin at all, it cleans my face and doesn't feel like any residue is left on my skin, this product certainly does live up to it's name and I'm very happy with my purchase, I honestly can't find anything I dislike about it.Overall, should you buy it? I would say yes, it's a very good quality cleanser and you don't have to drop a lot of money for it. Would I buy it again? I think so, I would like to give the 'Intense Hydration Cleanser' a try sometime.Pros:-Non-drying-Non-irritating-Effectively removes make-up-Smells nice-Has caused no breakouts at all.-Good product for a good price.-Refreshing and leaves no residue.-Long lasting, I've had it for about 4 months and I use it daily, still no sign of running out. I've been using this with my Clairsonic - cleans great and doesn't irritate my skin. best face product ive used! really saves my skin year round. i have had cystic acne for 6 years and combo skin. i have eczema as well and this face wash really really helps all that. ive used it for 3 years now and it helped clear my acne (i only have scarring now), it helps balance out the how dry and oily my skin is, and has never given me problems. a bottle lasts me around 3 months and i wash my face twice a day. i think its worth trying it out if you have sensitive acne prone skin, i never even tried their acne line since i figured itd be too harsh for me. just tried this and been using it for years and dont think ill stop! Loved this! I have super dry- sensitive skin and it leaves my face feeling so soft and clean. I wear CC cream so I use Micellar water to take the makeup off BEFORE using Burts Bees cleansing cream. I do this so the burts bees can do its job. Like I said before, it leaves my face so soft and clean. If you have super dry skin that is sensitive to cleansers, I'd give this one a shot. I purchased this at Walmart. I see a lot of people complaing about it not taking off makeup. WIPE YOUR FACE WITH MAKEUP REMOVER! This is a face cleanser not a make up remover.That being said, I like this product. My skin does funky things with cleaners. I have searched for years for a good lotion and cleanser. With this my face feels clean, doesn't feel dried out, and didn't turn red while using it. Left my face feeling smooth,non-irritated, and very clean! I have very sensitive skin and this was perfect! Will be buying this again. I have oily, acne prone skin and I LOVE this cleanser. Since it is soap free, it leaves your skin feeling nourished rather than stripped and ""squeaky clean"". I've never had any issues with break outs. Very gentle yet effective A month ago I changed birth control and it caused me to have a hormonal acne outbreak. My forehead was covered with tiny red bumps, the area around my nose was red and inflamed and my skin became very oily! I was at target looking at this and was pleased that it only had four ingredients. So many products for acne have many unnecessary ingredients that make acne worse like alcohol and perfume scents. After reading the reviews for this on here and on the target website, I gave it a try, plus it was on sale! When I would take a shower I would put it on after getting my face wet and keep it on while I did everything else, like a mask. The product is really thick, like lotion, and has a very faint scent which I love. Every morning when I woke up I'd touch my forehead to see how bumpy it was and it got more smooth every day. I believe I've used it every night the last 9 nights and I'm absolutely pleased with this! Just wow! My skin is so moisturized, too. I haven't had to put lotion on my face when I wake up in the morning since my acne started to clear up because of it. I also tend to furrow and arch my eye brows when I'm thinking and over the years has caused a line/wrinkle on the side of my forehead and it's like..gone. I can barely see it. So the moisturizing ingredient in this product has given better treatment than expected! So I have very sensitive skin and a number of allergies when it comes to common ingredients in skincare items. That said, this cleanser is amazing! It leaves my skin feeling moisturized and fresh, but doesn't cause me any redness or increased sensitivity. The smell is a little odd, but I can live with that. I was given this product by being a bzz agent. Ive been given lots of stuff to test, but THIS just hit the jackpot, my overly sensitive skin breaks out and turns red over most creams, or its just way to oily for my skin. My skin felt soft, and smooth and its just amazing. I have definately changed from my expensive brand to this its easy on the pocketbook and still makes my skin feel softer than that other stuff :) good I am a skin product and makeup junkie and have fair, 'normal' in terms of oiliness, sensitive skin (get rashes easily, blush, prone to breakouts and reactions to lots of things, even 'natural' substances).I have used most of Burts Bees other cleansers, as well as Perricone, Bliss, Shiseido, Korres, Boscia, jojoba oil, dove soap, and many other drug store brands where the ingredients looked good to me, and this cleanser is finally one I am using regularly and happy with.I apply this to my skin as a makeup remover at night. I apply and gently massage it in, then I usually try to let it soak in, for several minutes, then remove with a warm wet washcloth. I usually follow up with witch hazel rose water as a toner, then spray some Evian water on. Then I let my skin settle down before applying any other products (at least half an hour --just my preference and seems to reduce reactivity.) This stuff is pretty awesome. I have bad acne underneath my skin. I used this left on my face while i showered and didn't break out. Also my face looked smoother and some of the acne subsided. So im going to keep using this maybe my skin will get better. I didnt use a moistruizer after because this product really doesn't dry out your face."
B076BDFP9N," Good product. Will order again Very nice! I really liked ny mask thank u It's good I like the mud mask.  It is easy to use, rinses off easily and my face felt refreshed afterwards. I haven’t used it because it was a gift but I’ll let you know ..... It makes my skin feel fresh and clean. The mask feels natural and beneficial for my skin. I'm so glad I got this. As soon as it was delivered I tried it. When I put it on for the first time, my face felt so cool under the mask. After 30 mins I washed it off and my face could breathe. I have been using it every day now, for 8 days and my skin looks like I'm a little younger. :) love this product thank you I bought it for my teenage daughters to try as they are having issues with blackheads. Easy to apply. This is a washing off kind of mask, not a pull off your face mask. Makes your face feel like is going to fall off when the mask is fully dried! But it leaves your face feeling very soft as soon as it is washed off. Blackheads do not automatically come off after use, but rather are easier to squeeze off. Overall they like it. The mud mask seems to work well. The main thing I look for when using a mud mask is how does my skin feel after using. This one leaves my skin feeling moisturized but slightly tight. (If that makes sense) My skin is not oily though and it washes off well. I’m loving this mud mask! It makes my pores look smaller and my skin look smoother. My skin feels so clean and fresh after I use it, and my face looks better. Great quality ingredients too! I am amazed with this product, it better than I expected.  When the mud mask dries, my face doesn't feel like it hard and unmovable.  I also noticed that my skin is looking better. bought this for my daughter as she is having flair ups with acne. She said her skins feels smooth after she washes the mud off. Her skin is looking clearer. Nice size container for the price. Love the feeling of my skin after using this product. Feels smooth, fresh, and clean. This product does a great job at keeping my acne at bay and looking good. Good product. Great product and use it weekly. Face is clear and works great for oily skin. After removing the mask, my face felt so clean and visibly looked so much brighter! My skin is super sensitive, however, no breakouts, no redness or irritation - my skin feels soft and healthy. This is definitely going to be a once, or twice, a week treat! Thanks FineVine! Just got the product and have used it once.  I definitely could feel something happening - much more so than compared to other masks.  Afterwords, my skin felt and looked improved.  It did cause some itchy sensation at the end when the mask was nearly dry.  But the result was worth it.  I will keep using this. It’s not about go and use it, u have to prepare ur skin before apply this product, after the use the skin feels really great! Great product. Really tightens the skin Excellent product!  I bought one for my daughter and I to share and another for my friend and her daughter and we’ve all been very pleased with it! Amzing product. Your skin will be so soft you wont believe. Tried it for the first time on Sunday, it left my skin feeling nice and clean I like how little of the product I need to cover my face. This jar should last me a long time! Love this mask. It's also gentle enough for children. My 18 month old and 4 year old love it Easy to use and apply.  absolutely love this mask! I have an oily T-zone and this mask clears my pores, making my skin feel fresh and rejuvenated! I have been using it a lot lately and my skin has cleared up significantly. Last week, my face felt more clogged and oily than usual and I decided to use the mask twice. I could feel the immediate effects of the mask once I washed it off. The mask also seems to tighten my face while it's drying. I'm guessing that it is shrinking the pores :-)  I'm not so sure how it works, but it definitely works! My face now feels clean and clear. I love this mask! I have tried so many different brands in the past and now, this is my go to mask! I have not been using long enough to see a difference in wrinkles but such a difference in blackheads! I spray tan so clogged pores are a major issue because of the spray build-up and unfortunately I already suffer from bad skin. This has really cleaned out my pores and reduced the appearance of acne marks and scars. I initially used it during a girls night and we all pampered ourselves with our masks. Everyone felt that their skin felt deeply cleaned and smooth. Great gift for your lady friends! I am in love with this product!! See results immediately I am very satisfied.After cleansing using this product,It feels like my skin is soft.It may be due to mood, but it seems to have some effect.If I use this for a longer period of time I think I can see for sure. I really love this mask! My face has cleared up and feels super soft. My pores are smaller and my makeup goes on so much smoother. I have been using this for a week and the difference is amazing. This is so cool. I rinsed my face with warm water and applied this and I felt the tingling after about 15 minutes. It's so easy to wash off and my face felt amazing afterwards I've always wanted to try a charcoal mask and this one works great for my skin.  My skin get dry in the winter and when i used this mask I noticed my skin is so much smother and it's not as drying.  It doesn't have a strong smell either. This mask is like none I have used before it is easy to apply and easy to rinse off with warm warm water. It feels really refreshing after using it and gets rid of the blackheads. The mask is efficient and easy to use. The mud mask is great. It has really helped my skin. I apply a thin layer and once it's set and removed, my skin feels so refreshed and clean. It also is a decent quantity, so it is going to last awhile. This mask is incredible. Believe me, your face will feel so clean after washing it off. And the fact that it’s actual mud makes you feel very spa-like at home. Love this brand’s other products as well. I have always wanted to try activated charcoal products because I have heard they work wonders. I decided to treat my face to a little pampering and ordered this. I must say that my skin feels so smooth, soft, and supple. I also tried it on my boyfriend for his and her facials and he loved it. My skin is very sensitive and I usually have to be careful wuth what I use on my face but I haven't experienced any irritation or dryness. I plan on using on a weekly basis. Great stuff The feeling of this is incredible! It dries so quick andales.your.face feel nice and smooth afterwards! The smell is nice and subtle. Definitely helps with acne 😊 I really like this stuff. Whitehead’s I’ve been trying to get rid of for YEARS are coming off. Love the way it leaves my skin. Good product. Thank you. It definitely is a great product. Makes your skin smooth and feels refreshing. Can't wait to use more often to see how better it gets. I'd recommend this product. This mud mask is great. I've even been letting my teenager use it and he loves it. We are very happy with how it makes our skin feel after using it. It does the trick! I've used every other day since I got it. My face feels so clean & is soft, soft after use. Would recommend & will definitely be ordering again. I love this product! So far I've only tried it once, but I could tell a huge difference in how clean my skin was after using! The package contains a very good amount of product, and is well worth the price! Very happy with this mask thus far. Left my skin super silky soft and pores definitely appeared smaller! However, I had a small double-take with a misspelling on the label... ""Apply a 'think' layer"" is the first sentence of the Directions lol My daughter & I did a home ""spa night"" after she arrived here in Vegas and we did bubble baths & mud masks!  The mud mask was awesome because it went on smooth, dried in the time we each had our bath and then our skin was super smooth afterwards!  Two days later, we still have amazingly soft skin & less toxins! Great product! The very first time I used this mask, I could feel it working within minutes. After rinsing it off, my skin was unbelievably soft. I just received it a few days ago and have only used it once, but I look forward to applying it every few days to help my skin look and feel better. Helped clear up some breakouts on my combination and sensitive skin without drying my skin or irritating it. Washed off easily and left my skin soft. This mask has been great for rejuvenating my skin! It really helps the impurities come out of my skin and I feel like my skin is refreshed. I was really impressed with this mud mask. My skin felt great after I used it! We like this product ,it is awesome .Thanks FineVine for this service,👍 This is a great mud mask! From the first time I used it, I really liked how my skin felt afterwards. It goes on smooth not clumpy. I use a warm wash cloth to wipe it off. I leave it on for 20 mins, and immediately after my face feels & looks different. Skin is so soft and looks brighter. I use it twice weekly to keep that brightness going to my face. I have psoriasis & was worried about the adverse reactions - but it hasn’t affected it at all! Amazing product! Nice thick mask. Easy to spread, left my skin feeling clean & refreshed. Decent sized jar for the price too! I'm always looking for products to slow the look of aging skin.  This was recommended by a friend and does not disappoint.  I've used it a couple of times and already see a difference in my pores.  Looking forward to seeing results over an extended period of time. Fast delivery.. First time purchase of product was kinda of edgy if it would work. First time use I noticed my face more cleaner seemed more firmer been almost a week and used 3 times and face seems more softer and havent had any breakouts, and I have very oily sensitive skin. My daughter has used this a few times as well and she has semi medium acne issues on forhead and it seems to be helping but giving more time to see future results, so far so good. really loving this mask! My face feels so clear and super soft. My pores are smaller and my makeup goes on so much smoother. I have been using this for a week and the difference is amazing. I’ve been using this mask for several weeks and it’s really helped clear up my skin. There is a slight tingle while it’s drying. My skin is soft and feels wonderful once I remove the mask. Makes your skin so soft! Easy to apply and take off. This face mask is amazing! It doesn’t have a strong scent like other mud masks I’ve purchased. It went on so smooth and dried in a great amount of time!! Loved this mud mask! Good quality mud mask that leaves my skin feeling very soft and clean. I do have older fair skin that can run a bit dry, so I do follow up with coconut oil to moisturize though, just to boost the effect. For me, no more than 2 to 4 times a month is plenty, and I don't need all that much to work, which means this jar will last me quite a while. i love how my face feels after using this. I’m hoping that down the line, my blemishes will disappear. I feel comfortable knowing that I’m not putting harsh chemicals on my body. I highly recommend! Feels great on my skin doesn't leave discoloration. Didn't experience any irritation and left my face feeling nice.  Easy to wash off after it dries Leaves my skin soft Works great, easy to wash off and the residue doesn't leave a flaky mess like some other products. I have really big pores, so I've been delving into masks to try and combat acne/blackheads. Since this isn't a peel mask it also has the added benefit of being easier to work with if you're a guy and have some slight stubble.I've only used it thrice, so I can't attest to things like fading acne scars and wrinkles. This mask is incredible. I could tell that it exfoliated my skin and left my face feeling great. I have only used it for a few days but I can already tell a difference. I’ve also used it on my hands and that was nice too! My sister and I tried this together and we had a fun and memorable experience, which is more than money can buy! however, for the price and effectiveness of this product, I would recommend giving it a try. once applied to the face, it dries within minutes leaving a hard later on the skin that washes off easily. it's not a peel off. it may sting a little bit so if you have sensitive skin, be weary of this. I believe in this product, I would try it atleast once. they also have an excellent return policy and very friendly customer service. Emily is very sweet! Nice and affordable mud mask. I love that it has natural ingredients and a nice scent. I applied it and left it on to dry then washed with warm water. It made my skin feel clean and refreshed. I bought this mask to help moisturize and clear my skin. It works well and after use my skin feels super soft (refreshed). I use this mask once a week to give my face extra help to keep it looking clean and youthful. I live in a very dry place with hard water (none of which is good for skin) and this mask is great at helping to put moisture back in my skin. I love this mud mask! It feels really great on my skin. It was easy to apply to my face, and it was easy to take off. It has helped make my skin super soft and reduce my pores. Works Great!! Daughter loves it!! I have been dying to do a face mask, but was worried about one that you pull off. This is an awesome alternative.  The mask went on smooth and didn't use that much to cover my face.  I did test it on my hand since I have sensitive skin and had no issues.  Even thought you don't pull this off, it is still better to avoid hair when you can.  I was excited with how smooth my skin was after removing the mask.  I am looking forward to adding this to my beauty routine. This is excellent  mask... I'm 34 years olds and my skin looks smooth  and fresh.. I recommend  this mask if you are that kind of person who takes care your skin specially  the face. Recommend by a friend with beautiful skin. I'll never be as pretty, but I loved the results. I've used this project twice now. I'm very happy with it so far. My skin feels smooth and it's honestly helping with my audit acne already. It was very easy to apply and no need to add water, which reduces the mess. After leaving it on for 20 minutes, I saw a noticeable change in the lines on my forehead and even my crow’s feet and it washed off very easily with a hand towel and water. I love the feeling after it is washed off and now use it all the time! I loved everything about it so far. I've only used it for 2 days but it's already been helping my skin out. Thank you for selling something that works on everyone's skin!!!! Working great for my 18 year old daughter! Clearing up skin in days. I bought the eye gel from this same company. Both are high quality, organic, made in the USA. I’ve been hearing a lot about charcoal so I gave this a go since it’s a decent price. Leaves your skin really soft. Will try to incorporate it into my nightly routine. This mud mask did not dry out face. Used other brands in the past and my skin felt tight and dry.Easy to apply and easy to remove. Great price, will be buying again. Love this mud mask, it dries to a firmness on the skin and leaves the skin feeling vibrant and fresh...! I really do love it. It’s nice and smooth, easy to apply.

Highly recommended. love it Works great. The mask came just as expected. It's a gift for a 29yr old man. I am excited to hear about how it works for him I've constantly been using mud mask and I swear the benefits it has given me. I thought I'd try this one due to awesome reviews and way cheaper than the one I've been buying. It works great! The consistency is not too watery, adheres good on the face and no offensive smell. GREAT PRODUCT! After I took off my skin was so smooth and my pores were smaller. The only thing wrong with it is the typos on the jar, but that’s just because I notice everything. BUY IT.

B0177M6K8E," My husband uses this faithfully.  He has sensitive skin and he has no problem.  It smells great and his skin looks better. Great Product, my only complaint is the squeeze box is a bit difficult to work with. After using a mild soap product on my face for so long, Mr. Smith Daily Facial Cleanser is a very refreshing change. I've been using it for several weeks, now. And I'm happy with the clean feeling without any dryness that it gives me. My face feels neither dry or greasy after using this. It has proven to be a wee balanced cleaner that I will buy again when I've used this bottle up. Got this in addition to the moisturizer as a skincare regimen for my husband.  He likes the exfoliation and good ingredients, and I love the smell of this face wash.  Great product! Scent, and texture are unique.  I really like washing my face with this product. Love this product. Feels great on the face,cleans and leaves a nice scent. I only use one other face soap, an orange one by Neutrogena with salicylic acid in it.  Actually that is the soap I used to use before I was lucky enough to receive a sample of this Mr. Smith face soap to review.My old soap is great, it works great, but it tends to be too harsh and leave my face dry and flaky.  It is not a bad soap, but after using this Mr. Smith face cleaner I am going to switch brands.The best thing about this soap is that it is really gentle.  It does not dry out my face at all.  However it still does a great job of cleaning my skin.  I used to think that you needed a harsh soap to get a good clean face.  Apparently that is not the case.The soap smells light and pleasant.  I don't want to smell like fifteen different products when I come out of the bathroom every morning, so I really appreciate that this soap does not leave any smell or fragrance behind.  The smell while washing is nice and very light.The soap itself is pretty thick but comes out of the bottle easily.  The opening seems to be just the right size so that I am not getting too much or too little product when I use it.  It goes on easily and spreads and lathers nicely.  The sandy beads seem to scrub the skin but I am not sure how much difference this makes as I don't usually use any sort of face scrubbing product.  It washes off easily and does not leave any residue.The bead material seems to be made of nut shells.  This is great because a friend told me that the plastic beads in similar products end up in the ocean and are generally an environmental menace.  I am not sure what the impact is because I have not seen any articles on the topic, however I like that this product might be better for the environment compared to competing products as organic matter should degrade much faster in the environment compared to plastic.The bottle is quite large at the 8 oz size.  I don't mean that it won't fit in my bathroom; I keep it in the shower on a shelf.  It is big because with the small amount needed to wash my face I think that this bottle will last a very long time.The ingredients seem to be high quality but I am not really familiar with any of them.  While the product does do a good job of cleaning my face I can't yet say whether or not it has any anti-aging properties.  I have only been using it for two weeks or so and I think to see results I will need to use it for a longer period of time.All in all this is a great face soap, and will be my new go to product for facial cleansing. this product works really well. i use this along with the facial treatment mask and the lotion. my face feels 100 times cleaner and feels so smooth after. I've used this product for a couple days now and I'm happy with the way it makes my face feel. The first time I used the cleanser it was a little tough to squeeze out of the bottle but I got use to it after a couple uses. It has microscrub things in it that remind me of the apricot scrubs out there. This one has less tho. So it's not so harsh on your skin. The bottle is also bigger than I thought it would be. That makes it worth the money I think. There is not a strong sent coming from it making it a nice addition to my line of Mr. Smith products. I was given this as a sample for my opinion on the product. Over all I'm really digging this product. Very happy. My man loves the Mr. Smith Daily Facial Cleanser. The bottle is about medium sized, not too big and not too small. It has a very simple black and white design, which will look great in almost any bathroom. The cleanser itself is a thick, orange-brown colored gel with beads in it. It has a strong, earthy smell to it that seems really manly. It works great for my boyfriend to make his face softer, and doesn't dry his face out or anything. Overall, my boyfriend and I really like this and highly recommend it.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. This face was has a nice, weighty earthy smell without being overpowering.  The exfoliating beads in it are small enough to be gentle on your skin, yet powerful enough to slough off all the dirt and grime. After washing my face had the perfect balance- not dry, red, or irritated but also not oily.I received this face wash for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.  The views expressed here are solely my own. I originally got this for the hubby to use, but my nephew quickly took it when he saw it. He has been using it for a couple weeks and really loves it. He uses it after his shower and says it soften his face up really well. No after shave burn like some. Pleasant smell too, not overwhelming. He gives it 2 thumbs up and says this product really is awesome. I did recieve this at a reduced cost for my honest, unbiased opinion. This stuff works great. Very thick and not watered down, so you use a little and add water to foam it, then apply to face. Cleans well and has a light, manly scent.  Also, I have sensitive skin, so I was worried about trying it. I've had no problems at all.Hoping for the anti-aging to kick in. I'll let you know in a year.I received this free. I'm actually tougher on free items to review. Received a free sample of this product for review. Gave it to my boyfriend to try. He's a no frills, plain old soap and water kind of guy, but he really liked this wash. Felt good on the skin, gentle exfoliation and it smells great, too (I can vouch for that as well--left a very subtle, sexy scent when you get up close). Good stuff. This product works and smells great!  The only thing I disliked about it is that the top is a bit difficult to open, especially when in the shower with wet hands. Mr. Smith has been a great new line that I was lucky enough to be introduced to. The Face Cleanser is great - a light scrub with a great scent that cleans really well and rinses easily. I love that they use walnut as the exfoliant as opposed to micro-particles! And a little bit does go a long way! Plus, I like that the packaging is a little more masculine :) I bought this for my husband and he really likes it!  I have to order another one because I love it too!! It makes my skin feel really fresh and clean and unlike other face washes this doesn't cause me to break out :) Mr. Smith works great and smells great too! I used to use Neutrogena, but it did nothing for my break outs. Mr Smith's exfoliates, tones, and moisturizes leaving my skin looking and feeling like a million bucks! My Hubby is so happy with this. Got it for him and he said best face wash ever and told me to keep ordering this for him. I did notice hoe fresh and clean his face looked. And how soft it was to give him that kiss on the cheek. I was given the opportunity to try this product complimentary to review.  I have to say that first the shipping was very quick, and I loved the simplicity of the packaging. The facial cleanser definitely differed from a woman's cleanser, I immediately noticed that it didn't have that fruity floral smell. The coarseness of the wash was great for his tough skin and didn't cause dryness or flaky skin after use. This is the perfect combination of an exfoliator and cleaner in one. The only drawback is the bottle, the plastic is very hard which makes it hard to get out. You do have to do a few tough arm flings to get the product out. I got this for my husband and my 14 year old son saw it and started to use it, and his acne started to clear up, they both love it! Good face wash. It is mellow, does not have a strong smell to it, and its light enough to clean but not leave a soap residue on your skin. Fantastic product!! As a man who rarely uses something like this, I can say with confidence that this was a great product to use on my face. In my previous experience with similar products, I ended up with more acne and such. Very nice product! Great face cleanser."
B001DIOPIQ," love it paired with strawberry rhubarb dermafoliant Great product! Received as expected.  All good here. Love this product. I use Retina-A and this no-lather wash is amazing. Cleans thoroughly and leaves my skin soft with no drying effect. I just ordered one of their moisturizers. Be careful of some sellers out there. Have read of rip offs! The entire product line is amazing!  This is a smooth cleanser, face feels very soft and clean after. Great price!!!! Best stuff! Great for dry skin and smells amazing. Definitely keeping this product stocked in my house! Love this cleanser, been using it for a couple years now.  It goes a long way, you only need a small amount and it smells great and is so gentle and cleansing. I love this milk cleanser!  My skin is quite sensitive, sometimes normal, sometimes a little dry, this products meets my face and neck cleaning needs.  It also has a lovely coconut natural scent, very light and refreshing.I highly recommend this product, try it, you will love it too! does not dry my face like other products!!! no allergies ! I'm good to go :) So far, so good. Love the smell! Use it everyday, smells great and it is perfect for my skin type(normal). Wonderful hydrating cleanser! You can add Strawberry Rhubarb Exfoliant once a week with it. Worth the price! Excellent product I always have a hard time with skin cleansers because I have such sensitive skin but so far I've been very pleased with this gentle and comfortable cleanser.  Will definitely try more of their products. Love love love this cleanser. Dissolves eye makeup like a champ and gets my face really clean without drying.  I have super dry skin so this product is a huge plus for me. Purchased for my sister...She loves it!! I love everything about this creamy cleanser.  It smells so good, like fresh coconut.  Also it is so hydrating and creamy and feels great on my dry skin.  Works well to remove my makeup and does not sting the eyes.  I will definitely be reordering this! I love this product. I first bought it at a SPA and now I can find it on Amazon. LOVE< LOVE< LOVE IT! Lightweight and organic! Very strong coconut smell As expected! Love eminence My wife swears by it. I love Eminence products, and this one is one of my favorites. All natural, moisturizing cleanser, gentle on the skin, with a great fresh coconut scent. Love it. Takes off makeup and moisturizers your skin. Smells good too For my wife she like it My favorite all-time cleanser!  This stuff is amazing.  It smells like you could eat it.  My skin feels so soft and luscious.  Highly recommended for normal-dry skin types. love this and it smells great, now my friends ask me what I use all the time, all great products from Eminence. I recommend this product and all their products for everyone. A creamy lovely face wash that smells heavenly. My face feels soft and moisturized after using. Great product!  With the drying winter weather and the indoor heat, this keeps my skin soft and silky feeling. Really nice cleanser. Doesn't make my skin feel tight or dry and has a pleasant scent. Very creamy. Love love this product smells great and leaves my skin hydrated This is very gentle for my sensitive skin and has a very light smell. I use this cleanser after I remove my make-up. It is my cleanser for life! I have used this for over two years. It cleans my skin and makes it moist. Nice face wash- smells AMAZING! A little heavier than the sensitive formula but good overall. Love it! Will buy again for my salon. I love this stuff I feel like it's this decadent, silky treat that I get to lather on in the shower.  It smells and feels so good!  Not sure how good it cleanses but it moisturizes well and it luxurious when using... This is a wonder cleanser!! It even takes of my makeup!! I love it. Very happy with this choice. Helps take my make up off. Great purchase Love it! Seems like everything is made for oily skin so it's wonderful to find a good cleanser for dry skin.  Definitely recommend. Love this product line. My skin reacts and itches to almost all products I have tried in the past. This line causes no flare ups and is wonderful. Awesome face cleanser. Great for excessively sensitive skin. I have dry skin so this product is amazing I thought it might leave me to oily but it doesn't it's amazing for pre shave  wash it's soothing to the skin and has  for me cut  down on the red irritated skin after shaving I'm really impressed how long it lasts me Love this product.  Use it all the time. Makes  my skin feel wonderfully soft. love this product really helps clear up blemishes always have liked it So far so good!  I have dry, sensitive skin and very sensitive eyes.  For me this is not very moisturizing but it doesn't seem to be drying either and the best part (fingers crossed) is it removes my non-waterproof mascara, so no separate eye makeup remover needed (which is tricky for sensitive eyes)!!  Hoping this remains status quo (sometimes a reaction has occurred for me over time...), so I have a new organic face cleanser!!  (o: I have dry skin and use this cleanser everyday for my face. Skin feels soft and clean, won't dry out the skin after cleansing. This is my favorite face cleanser. The product arrived on time and as expected. Nice gentle cleanser, lovely tropical aroma, does the trick. I also appreciate the ingredients use; I love this brand overall. Haven't had a breakout since I started using this (over a year now). I have dry skin. This removes makeup really well too but is very mild on the skin. Plus you don't have to use a lot which is great so it lasts a long time. It is a bit pricey but I only go through 2-3 bottles a year - not bad. This is one of the best products I've used on my face.  Eminence products are first rate in quality -- my skin glows! After being told by a couple of different spas that my skin was dehydrated,I finally decided it was time to make a change. Since my skin always feels fabulous after a facial and every spa I go to uses Eminence I decided it was time to take their advice. I love the coconut cleanser and quite frankly every item I have tried from Eminence. Sorry I waited so long. My skin feels so soft and supple. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT This is not a deep cleansing product but it does what it sets out to do....mild cleanser that provides lots of hydration. No irritation. Great product. However, wish just once that the pump would work. Haven't had one yet that has worked.  Have to take the top off and dump the cleanser out in my hand. I'm not the only ione my sister has had similar luck. Five stars for the product, one star for packaging. I have very sensitive skin and on top of this I live in a very dry climate (Wyoming).  I have been trying all types of products and when I was in a salon I noticed this brand being sold.  They gave me a lot of samples and I used up all of them and I knew I had to get the full size product.  I decided to buy from Amazon because I can usually find products cheaper here.  This product is expensive but well worth every penny.  My face and neck feel amazing!  I will never go back to any other products again for my skin.  Eminence has 100% support from me! love this product I love all eminence products. I have used them for over 5yrs. I have dry skin and the coconut cleanser is very hydrating.Not to mention they are one if the greenest companies around. I won't use anything else. Works good. Smells delicious and is very gentle on the skin. I usually use it twice in a row to thoroughly clean my face. This is a perfect cleanser for aging skin. Enjoying the product. I have used many cleanser's over the years which either make my face dry or to oily.  This is my first try at the Coconut Milk Cleanser and I LOVE IT! It makes my skin very soft, smooth and healthy looking.  Does not dry my skin or make it to oily.  I think I have found a product for life. Love ...!!!! Great product ! Favorite skincare products. Love. I bought this face wash for my 12 year old son who is interested in taking care of his skin and is cleansing daily. He loves the scent, and the way it makes his skin feel. That is a huge success for me because he is picky. I purchased the Bright Skin Cleanser from this line for myself and I absolutely love it as well. My skin feels clean, yet smooth. My skin doesn't feel tight and dry after cleansing with it. Although I do apply face lotion twice a day as well. This lotion is my night time cleaner, taking off all my makeup including mascara......smells wonderful, too! Only face wash that doesn't  irritate or inflame This is the best cleanser for sensitive skin. Super gentle on my sensitive skin. Love the way it smells, too. I wash my face with this cleanser every day and it helps my eczema so much!  I can't live without it! Love, love, love this product! Love this cleanser This is an amazing product. It always leaves my skin soft and never dried out. My skin is more balanced, and I have a more supple complexion. It's so luxurious on your face! Highly recommend! Not only has the Eminence product line improved my skin, remarkably, but because I'm a vegetarian, their being vegan is a BIG plus. Excellent !!  Recommend other Eminence products also. been using this brand for several years and LOVE it. Is gentle for sensitive skin and cleans deep down. I also use their serums and moisturizer. I think I found the best cleanser in the world. Washing your face--boring but necessary chore becomes super pleasant when your cleanser has a bit of a coconut smell (yum) and your faces feels dewy after you're done. My complexion is definitely improving with the use of this as well. I'll buy it again and again and again. used it for a while now and have been nothing but satisfied Very moisterising for mature skin ! Product was fresh! Received item fast and in perfect condition. This cleanser smells great! Leaves your skin soft and clean. This product is great for any skin type. Great cleanser for both eyes & face! Very gentle on eyes, no irritation. Convenient so you don't have to use 2 products. I like that in an age of ""Simple is better."" Really love this product... it is fragranced (gently with coconut) and really soothes my skin when it is dry... bought it again already... great price too This is the most luxurious cleanser. The scent is light. Cleanses very well while being gentle. I've been using this product for a couple of years now. Nothing else compares to it for gentle cleansing with numerous skin benefits. I'm so glad that I found Eminence products.  This cleanser is by far the best I've used, and I've used most department store brands over the past 30+ years.  I recommend it highly for those of you with sensitive skin and skin with tendencies to breakouts/clogged pores.  This cleanser is made of pure, organic ingredients, which my skin obviously appreciates.  Don't hesitate to give this product a chance. Love all Eminence products.  This is the best cleanser and great for sensitive skin. This smells soo good. After i was my face it feels super soft and leave my face very refreshing! Love it. Best cleanser! Love it so much. All natural and smells lovely. Very gentle, and smells wonderful.  Even my husband likes it! Great for my sensitive skin My favorite of the Eminence cleansers so far - great for dry skin. Great Product LOVE this stuff!! like butter for your face. It's great to use in the morning to rehydrate your skin, after a whole night of sleep! This company makes great products which work really well on my sensitive skin. Wife LOVES it...says it is amazing...even her makeup looks better cause her skin is so much better. Tried Mary Kay for a while...but caused pimples, she is oily/dry combo, and this is only thing she will use at this point...period...it cleans like nothing else.... I have tried many different products from Oil of Oley to Clinique to Uspa and I love this product! Eminence is superior to them all. My skin is smooth and fresh with a youthful appearance, which is pretty amazing since I am nearly 60 year old! This is the only product I have truly seen noticeable improvement with. I highly recommend you try the entire line! ~♡♡♡~ This is a wonderful cleanser for those of us with aging skin. Not only does it smell amazing but it also does a great job of cleaning up the oils off my face. I've noticed an improvement in my skins texture since I've started using. I have combo/oily skin and decided I needed a creamy oil-based cleanser as a pre-cleanse for my nightly routine (to help take the make-up off). This works fantastically well. Granted I use a clarisonic with this cleanser so that might help as well, but I've tried other oil based cleansers that don't work as well to clean even with my clarisonic.I love the way my face felt after washing it. It looked soft and felt like it too. And my face was clean! I thought it worked so well that I'm thinking this could be my only night cleanser. We'll see. When I get facials they used this on me. I am so glad to be able to use it everyday at home. This price is great too because at the salon it's way more. Where I live the winter can be harsh on your skin.  I have tried many different facial care products and each has failed in one way or another.  The Eminence collection works.  I purchase this cleanser and I am happy that I did.  I've had this product for awhile now and it is cold here and I have not experienced any dry patches on my skin nor flaking of my skin.  This cleanser is a winner! This line is amazing!!! I don't even know where to start.  I use the coconut cleanser with the strawberry rhubarb dermafoliant.  Then I make them into a paste.  Every night, I do this and not only do I love the way it makes my skin feel, but it smells amazing! Eminence coconut milk cleanser is one of the best cleansers I've ever used. The cleanser is extremely gentle yet effective. It leaves the skin soft and clean. Love the coconut smell, too. I ordered this Coconut Cleanser and absolutely LOVE it!! I have really sensitive/dry skin and allergic to most products especially with perfumes/fragrances....this cleanser has a subtle coconut scent and makes my skin feel dewy soft,clean but not dry at all, then I follow this routine with the Eminence coconut age corrector moisturizer....a little bit of this facial lotion is all that is needed to cover your entire face & neck(dilute with water)...I usually use this cleanser in the Winter & Spring,then switch over to the Lemon and firm Skin Acai cleansers in the Summer time....the Naseberry moisturizer is also a super one to use....I have tried most of the Eminence products! A gentle cleanser that removes makeup and all the day from my face but doesn't leave any after product on my skin.  I never feel dry after using this cleanser but it still feels clean. I've been using this for about a week and already see a difference in my skin texture. I leave it on during my whole shower then wash it off and my face is smooth and moisturized. The only negative is I don't think it removes makeup very well but that's not a deal breaker for me. I love Eminence products! My skin is really smooth and soft! Great Product great cleanser very hydrating I have combination skin, but is extremely sensitive.  I find this calms down my face, but leaves extremely soft.  The smell is an absolute awesome bonus.  You will not be disappointed. I love Eminence and this is wonderful! Good, like it. I purchased this for my sister and she said she likes the result. The skin is so smooth, glowing refreshed and everything she feels good about this cleanser I love all Eminence products love the smell and texture"
B008HBMQTM," love Nice, soft cleaning cloths.  They remove all my makeup easily and have a nice delicate smell. I love the exfolation Really works well to clean off make up, but is still gentle. Nice product Amazing product! As always Burts makes a wonderful product! MY FAVORITE HG WIPES I keep these in my bag for freshening up throughout the day. These are great for when you don't have time to wash your face properly before going out or need to freshen up a bit after work. Worked well on our trip to Ireland. Always able to get face clean and didn't have any issues for my sensitive skin. I love these! I use these after the La Fresh waterproof makeup remover towels to get every last bit of make-up on my face. Then I follow with the Burt's Bees Intense Hydration Night Cream. This towelette leaves a fresh feel, not sticky, but cleans very well. Good to keep in the car, work desk, or anywhere when you need a refresh!  Worth the money but priced nicely! I have sensitive skin and wear makeup almost every day. These Burt's Bees wipes with Cotton Extract are gentle and soft enough not to irritate or sting my skin and have the ability to remove all of my makeup (I always use two wipes to get resilient makeup off). They also have a gentle, pleasant scent. I have used neutrogena and kirkland makeup wipes in the past, which have irritated my skin so I am pleased to have found this product. I'm an Esthetician and normally frown upon face wipes but I'm also a new mom and looking to find ways to cut down time on my evening routine. I still wash after using these most times if I have makeup on. If I don't have makeup on I don't wash after. I've tried s ton of wipes and really like these. They get my makeup off without irritating my skin. They also remove waterproof eye makeup gently and effectively. I highly recommend these. I get one pack a month on the subscribe and save. The only cleansing wipes that I will use on my face. These wipes have a very nice gentle smell and are think enough to only need 1 wipe. The wipe is also big enough to use on my face. It takes off my makeup (even waterproof) very well and leaves my skin smelling and feeling extremely nice. I use them every night and would not go back to any other cleansing wipe now! Love these!  I have super sensitive skin on my face and even some of the other sensitive all natural products will make me break out sometimes.  Not these!  They are perfect and do a great job at cleaning off my makeup and dirt from the day...without causing any red itchy hives/breakouts.  LOVE THEM! ExcellNt product, gently wipes away makeup The wipes thick, they feel like cloth.  Full size, about 8 x 8.  No residue, I rarely rinse after.  They don't dry my skin out or irritate.  These remove eye makeup well.Only downside is the plastic cover.  It latches ok but doesn't really seal the moisture in.  Keep the sticky tab inside, it does seal it.  Not a problem since the cloths come out only one at a time. Love this stuff!  I use it every day, and also keep a package in the car for post excercise class, and  Granddaughter's Karate class.  It is gentle enough and pure enough for her young skin.  Also, it is almost 2 bucks less on Amazon than in my local store!!  I buy this every time I have an order over $25 b/c it is an add on item. Works wonders on my skin. And, if I gently scrub in a circular rubbing motion, it exfoliates my skin very well. I'm a fan.I use them every evening right after I wash my face, so that all the dead skin comes off (of which there is plenty). Now, of course, everyone's skin is different, for my sensitive, oily complexion this is working out just fine. They dont have the best smell, but this is the only one Id found (and Ive tried many) that doesnt sting my skin! So for that Ill accept the not so pleasant smell over a burning/stinging skin. I switched for a while to witch hazel cleansing towelettes but went back to these. I think they are the best available, the most soothing and least likely to bother your skin. Great set of wipes. I have sensitive skin and I have no problems with it. I have no problems with the smell. I wear light to medium makeup and this wipe does the trick. You know those nights when you are just too tired to remove all your makeup? Well.. these are amazing and really help to alleviate my guilt if I am too tired to wash my face. Oops... They are also great for removing eye make up and I feel good knowing that they are more natural than other eye makeup removing products. I use these all the time. My face was breaking out after switching to a liquid face wash so I decided to switch back to Burt's Bees. My skin is finally back to normal. Will never switch again! Can't live without this product!  Well, I suppose I could, but I would really rather not!  I have sensitive skin to many products, but experience no discomfort using these wipes.  I don't wear a ton of makeup, but even the days that I go a little heavier, it removes every trace of it.  Best prices here on Amazon as well, even when on sale at other drug stores.  I order a couple at a time because I never want to run out! These are great. They do a great job of cleaning the skin and leave it feeling really nice and smooth but not greasy or oily like some other wipes. I leave these next to my bed as a back up plan for washing my face if I'm too lazy or take them with me traveling to freshen up on the go. Highly recommend. I repurchase these time after time. They are an affordable, cruelty free, non-toxic product that really works. I usually use it in the morning instead of a cleanser as a short cut.  They easily remove any lingering eye makeup and grime. Great to have as I'm applying makeup to wipe off foundation or makeup that I may have on my hand or fingers, or for fixing mistakes. Love these! Not harsh on my super sentive skin, gets my makeup off. My boyfriend has been using them to clean his face at night too. Doesn't leave you feeling super dried out either. This is the best facial cleansing wipes I have used. I wear contact lenses and these never irritate my eyes. They remove make-up including waterproof brands. I love this product!  These cloths remove heavy eye make-up easily and using only one cloth.  They leave my skin completely clean. I reordered them and have sinceBurt's Bees  Sensitive Facial Cleansing Towelettes with Cotton Extract, 30 Count added them to my subscribe and save account. I love the clean feeling my face gets when I use these.  I use them to remove makeup, and I even use them lightly on my eyelids.  They work great!  They clean up my face and wipe off makeup with one swipe.  They don't leave behind a residue, but I do get a slightly tingly clean feeling after using one. I love these. Remove makeup like a champ and do not dry my skin out. I break out so easy and have never had any breakouts while using these. I use these wipes mostly when I travel. Instead of taking the whole package, I place the # I'll need in a little baggie. They clean my face well including makeup and don't irritate my skin. I love burt's bees products because they never irritate my sensitive skin! My only complaint is I do wish these towelettes would remove eye makeup as well. Even though they say you don't have to rinse after, I find that I still do because my eye makeup doesn't budge much. Even so, these are great for removing facial makeup and dirt! I love these cloths!  They are a quick and easy way for me to remove my makeup without using water and soap when I need to do that (i.e. traveling).  They don't have a scent which is key for me because I'm very sensitive to smells.  They don't sting my face and I have sensitive skin.  They are gentle enough to use around my eyes.  I am able to clean off all of my makeup on my face and my bronzer on my neck and still wipe down my chest with one cloth.  I love these and the subscribe and save option is great for me! I take these in my carry-on bag when I travel as well as camping. They used to be part of my daily cleansing routine, but my aging skin needed a little more than what this product is designed to do. It does a great job on younger skin and works just fine when I travel and camp and don't want to lug around bottles that are impractical for camping and would not get past TSA in carry-ons. Great wipes. I normally get the citrus or apricot ones. But these are soft and won’t burn your skin of your sensitive to certain ones. My sister had a double mastectomy and couldn't shower or raise her arms to wash her face properly for weeks. She LOVED these to help keep her face clean during recovery. They are gentle and the scent did not trigger her migraines (perfume is a problem for her) which was especially not to have to worry about new products causing migraines during a time when everything else was causing migraines. The are the most gentile wipes I have ever found and I have very sensitive skin so this is my go to for removing make-up or just a refresher. My favorite facial cleansing wipes are these.  They are gentle, very softly scented, and do not irritate my eyes.  Love them. Burt's Bees all natural products never disappoint. These facial clothes clean NAD remove eye makeup. Safe enough for sensitive skin as well as delicate under-eye tissue. What a bargain. No mess, no extra liquid, just moistened toilette towels that can be used on both sides. Another hit for Burt's Bees. This is my favorite facial wipe.  Gets rid of your make up easily, gently on your skin.  Perfect amount of wetness, doesn't leave your face feeling icky as some of the other wipes do.  Although I don't recommend it, but you can use this and not have to wash your face afterwards. Love these face wipes. These are these only ones I've found that don't make my eyes sting after washing my makeup off. These facial wipes are just what I was hoping for. Gentle, no stinging, no scent and leaves my face without the need to finish with a water rinse. Very important to me that Burt's Bees products are Cruelty Free. These are fantastic!  My baby has eczema and these are great to clean his face/hands after he eats without drying or irritating his skin. I have always been a fan of these wipes, they're super soft and get the makeup off without the rough scrubbing you'd have to do with the cheap wipes. I love these! As a cleaning wipe you would expect this to dry your skin, but my skin actually feels softer after use. I have very sensitive skin and this does not bother me at all. Love all the Burts Bee stuff! I have very sensitive skin and I have found that these are just the thing that I need. They remove all dirt, make up an anything else that may be lingering upon your face. They have a nice, clean scent and are moist as should be. I will be buying these again. Other towelettes make my face feel itchy and irritated, these don't. These are really nice!I have tried many different kinds, and this one is simply the best! They are extra-large sized, so you can fully clean your face, neck and decolletage with one wipe.  When I am just washing my face, I cut the cloth in two, so I get an extra use out of 1 towelette.Wonderful I get these on subscribe and save every month and I really like them! I have never found that they sting my eyes at all, but I have found that if you open a package you'd better use it up in a month or it'll dry out! Other than that.... these are so nice! Love burts bees!  These are great to just freshen up mid-day or fix that mascara mistake, or use in place of a face wash on those days I just want t crawl into bed at 7pm.  VERY mild scent, very light, no residue on your face but does not leave skin dried out either.  Highly recommend. These are fantastic for my sensitive skin. I have ordered them more than once and will continue to do so. They are also wonderful for traveling. I take them on camping trips too. This is the perfect daily wash for my neck, chest, and back and has significantly reduced my chest and back acne. No harsh perfumes, no sticky feeling afterwards. I have very sensitive skin and I get no irritation from this product. Love it! I have purchased this a couple times now. I love this for my sensitive skin. I even have my daughter using it now too. Love Burt's Bees!!! These are my favorite makeup remover/cleansing wipes. The towel is sturdy, the product lifts all the makeup off my skin, and this product doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. Very refreshing and light feel as well. My second time purchasing. Each wipe is well saturated; sometimes I'll use only half a sheet. I like to bring them camping or on plane rides for a no-rinse face cleaning/refresher. Gentle enough to use over the eyelids. Once dried, my face doesn't feel sticky with residue. I'm quite surprised that these wipes have worked on my super sensitive skin. I've had a need for a quick facial wipe to remove makeup in the last few weeks, and these have been great, with no break-outs. I will definitely keep using these! Works great to quickly remove make-up at night. Especially convenient when traveling. I adore these. They leave my face feeling clean and it's pretty good at removing eye makeup. I use daily and will continue to. !!! Beware, they changed the package - now, instead of a plastic lid, they have a regular sticky cover, and the package feels thinner, maybe they changes the quality, too.Very thick and  soft, cleans well, smell is very faint and rather pleasant. Nice to put on the tired face in the evening. Doesn't cause pimples even on my very sensitive skin. These are great for taking off makeup, getting goop out of your eyes, or a quick refresh. One of the few ""scentless"" products to be genuinely scentless. Very gentle, not drying or irritating. Great product. Nice and easy to use. These are perfect! Love that this is a cruelty free brand and the wipes work great. These are so great and the price on Amazon is always the lowest price! These come in REALLY handy when I am on the run and don't have time for an entire beauty routine and I just need to clean my face and GO.  I have lots of allergies and sensitivities to chemicals, but these wipes do not affect me badly at all. I enjoy this sensitive skin cleansing product.  Removes makeup nicely with no mess. These do a very good job at removing make-up.  I have extremely sensitive skin and haven't had any trouble with scaliness or redness.  Very gentle. I really like these face wipes and find them to be a much higher quality than other store brand face wipes. The wipes are larger than usual and they do a good job removing makeup and helping my face feel clean. The material is very soft. I love them.I've been using these for years. They are gentle, not too fragrant. I switched from Neutrogena because I get dermatitis. These don't do anything bad to my sensitive skin. I'm a very happy customer. Takes off makeup, doesn't irritate, doesn't smell too girly so the man can freshen up with them too if needed. Good price to begin with, even better on subscribe and save, very convenient to not have to haul the same stuff home over and over! Oh, and they are Burt's Bees, so I feel good about what's in them! These are great.  They don't make me break out and leave no residue on my face.  I use them at night to take off my makeup.  Work well for my sensitive skin. I've used the regular Burt's Bees Facial Cleansing Cloths and they somewhat irritated my skin, and I didn't like the smell. However, these are really gentle and have little to no smell at all...but they took off all of my makeup with ease. My wife asked for this entire line as a gift and has been very happy with the results. My wife recently tried Burt's Bees sensitive facial cleansing cloths and she loved it so much that she made me try it. She loved how well it removed her make up but more than that, she  loved how clean and fresh her face felt afterward. Once I tried it I was impressed because not only do I have very oily skin, but I also have a very rough face due to my facial hair so I thought that the wipe would break apart easily. To my surprise it did not rip apart. The wipes are pretty big and thick compared to other brands my wife has tried, and  it removed all the oil, dirt, and sweat off my face. My face was so clean and fresh that I decided that I would start using this product myself. It is conveniently packaged, so I can carry it with me in my car since we travel alot, and I will be able to feel fresh and clean at all times.These wipes are also made for sensitive skin, so I believe I can even use it for my kids. I would recommend this product to everyone. I bought this for travel but ended up getting more to use randomly or day to day when needed. They do a great job with makeup removal. Quick, easy and can be brought on the airplane. Just what I needed. Burt bee products are great for my sensitive skin. Wonderful product!  Takes off make-up easily and gets any excess dirt from the day off with a cool, smooth cloth. I have very sensitive skin and my face felt clean and moisturized with no irritation. They also smell really good.  Furthermore, the package holds 30 wipes in a package, whereas other brands only hold 20. Great deal! Burt's Bees always delivers with products with natural ingredients you can feel. Excellent cleansing product! Works great on sensitive skin. It doesn't have an overpowering scent. Love the convenience, the all natural products used to make these facial cleansing clothes and that they don't dry my skin out.  I buy them through the Subscribe and Save program to keep the cost down. I love this product, I have been using it for years. Removes makeup well and doesn't have an over powering scent. I love cleansing wipes and have tried a lot of brands. This is definitely in my top 2. However, the price is a bit more than I prefer to pay. I only bought this once because my regular one was out. So often I find myself exhausted from the day, piled up in bed, remembering I really need to wash my face and use some cream before going to sleep.  I keep these by the bed and I can keep reading my book while I clean my face.  They really work and aren't harsh for my skin, which is old and sensitive! These are awesome. I have been using them a lot when I can't wash my face. They barely smell like anything and I like that they are safe and easy on my skin. Ok, I have tried nearly every brand of face wipes out there.  I have decided these are the best for me because of the overall size (larger than most), low scent (but the scent is nice), softness and cleaning ability.  They do not leave my face feeling dried out and do a great job getting off stubborn mascara and the price is pretty good too. I love keeping these in my gym bag. They work well and don't break out my sensitive skin. They are also softer than other brands I've tried. These work really well. They have a slight fragrance but it's not too strong and the wipes themselves are extremely soft and cottony. I'm very happy with them. Wonderful smell and texture. Ive used off brand makeup wipes for as long as Ive worn makeup but i switched to these because how can you go wrong with any Burt's bees product right? well they definitely didn't let me down! they smell good , it takes your makeup off with ease and they don't burn your eyes which is definitely a plus in my book. love these :) Cleanses my face without harshly striping it.

Great product Love these - I take my make-up off with them - they are really large - like a face cloth. Gentle and although you only use it once - they are really a way to pamper your face.  They are refreshing too. I do really like these ones--mild, and gets all of my make up off at the end of the day, or if I don't feel like washing my face. I have to say though, other than the lack of stinging my eyes, I don't think it's that much different than the costco ones (which are obviously a lot more affordable). I'll probably go back to the Costco brand once these run out. Good product, Clean Feeling After using. Easy to use, soft cloth for removing make-up.Paba free. Cloths are large enough to use 1/2 of the cloth. I use this every day to remove makeup and wash my face. Has significantly improved my complexion. I have extremely sensitive, fair skin.

I can't wear much makeup at all, but this product really helps me get my eye makeup off without any irritation at all.

Foundation or heavily applied eye shadow or similar will get pushed around rather than all absorbed, so then you have to sort of wipe off the streaks. But I have no sensitivity trouble with using them for eye make-up removal. They aren't great at removing very persistent liquid liner or other heavy make-up, but that is true of most delicate cleansers.If you don't go through the pack quickly, as I didn't with my previous one (this is the second pack of these I've had), it is easy to simply dampen the cloth with some water and the wipe is then effective that way. Love these.  I take them everywhere with me. not much to review.. it says it is facial cleansing towelettes and that is exactly what it is.  They cleanse well and with sensitivity.

B004072TCG," Can dry out skin, becareful if your sensitive. This cleanser was first recommended to me by my dermatologist and available from her office, but it was much cheaper on Amazon! I was skeptical at first, especially because the cleaner is a clear gel that felt so mild on my skin, but it has totally changed the texture of my skin to very smooth and even after prolonged use. I could also tell a difference after only a few days of using this face wash consistently (I wash once a day in the morning in the shower). I have continued to purchase and use this cleanser for years! great My dermatologists office carries and recommends this range of products but it is much more expensive to purchase in the surgery. I was pleased with the first cleanser I bought so I purchased another online from Amazon. I am happy with the product so I will continue to use it. I saw results within 3 days of using this cleanser. I don’t feel like I need an extra exfoliating mask as before. Now I’m trying the serum! Very good cleanser. I have used for awhile and I will keep using it because I do think it helps my fair complexion. Great product. Recommended by my daughter who is a beautician and skin specialist. Leaves skin vibrant and glowing. Doesn't over strip. Love it. I love this product for my night time routine. When I wake up my skin feels super soft and my pores look tighter. I cannot recommend this enough! I also got my mother hooked on the neocutis gentle cleanser. I am so impressed with this line. I will continue to try more from it. Love this cleanser!! It's a little harsh for use more than once a day, but it can't be beat for quality and effectiveness. Highly recommend if you have tried a lot of different cleansers and nothing has worked for you. It is expensive for a pretty small bottle, but so worth it. Awesome face wash.  leaves skin looking amazing This cleanser has been amazing for my skin! It has cleared up a lot of my problematic areas and my face has a glow! Just like the one I purchased at the spa! It's a nice cleanser for once or twice a week. It's too strong for daily use. I've used it for awhile now My dermatologist recommended this line of skin care.  This cleanser leaves my face feeling soft and refreshed.  It's designed for use in the morning and at night, and is very gentle, yet does a great job exfoliating. Coupled with the Gentle Cleanser in the am and Exfoliating Cleanser in the evening....perfect combo and happy for may years,! Love it! It works as it should, but be sure to follow your dermatologists recommendation for usage. This product was recommended by my dermatologist. It works great with keeping my acne-prone oily skin clear and clean. Gentle exfoliation, easy, thorough clean. Love this cleanser so gentle and glycolic included. Feels so clean! Best face cleanser! Love this stuff! Excellent products.  Do what they say they will! Big hit with the recipient. My face seems to be clearer! The ONLY face wash I use. It's an exfoliating gel that is amazing. Keeps skin fresh and glowing. Good stuff I love this cleanser! Just like the identical product I purchased from my dermotologist & this product from Amazon was much more afforrable. Super! I had under the skin acne for years. I started getting facials and trying various products that the esthetician recommended. I also used retina since several dermatologist recommended it. The congestion deep under my skin remained though. Estheticians couldn't even do extractions because it was so deep. Finally my current dermatologist recommended this cleanser and i bought it on amazon. The congestion under my skin cleared up in about 4 weeks. I am now on my fourth tube of this cleanser. I still use retina periodically for the ""anti aging"" benefits.I will tell you to be careful around your lips because it made mine raw and sore when i got it right to the line.To sum it up- Best facewash ever! I am truly enjoying this skin cleanser, it is working wonders and helping to clear my skin. A medium consistency clear gel. Love Neocutis products! This is a great facial scrub/wash! Excellent product. My skin is happy! Love it! I use a lot of the Neocutis products and this one is at the same level of effectiveness as all of their products. A bit pricey, but worth it. This is a great cleanser.  My skin is sensitive and has occasional breakouts.  Since using this product, my skin looks and feels better...much clearer and smoother.  I love it! Feels tingly. Leaves skin cleannnnnnnnnn I had this recommended to me by my dermatologist. This is the only facewash that can clean all the gross gunk out of my pores and keeps my face from breaking out during PMS! I have tried so many other kinds! This is the absolute best and I can't ever use another or my face feels gross and like it hasn't even been cleaned. This product was recommended to my by my dermatologist and I now use it all the time.  Great on sensitive skin. Love this product!  Makes your skin soft and tightens it up!  I first bought it from a Spa where I had some facial treatments and loved it.  Thought I'd check around for a better price and found it here.  It can burn a little if your skin is not use to it but that subsides after a few treatments.  It only takes a little pea size to do your face, so don't waste it!  You won't be disappointed.  Cleared up my small bouts of acne.  They also make a sunscreen with a little tint that is nice for a ""no makeup day"". I was recommended this by my anesthetist.  It was sold in the spa for twice the amount here on amazon so I am great to have looked around before purchasing it first.It is very mild for the skin and leaves a clean feeling.  My face is much clearer and feels a lot cleaner when using this product.  I recommend this to anyone who has mild acne and who has sensitive skin.I STILL LOVE THIS PRODUCT BUT IT HAS GONE UP SEVEN DOLLARS SINCE I LAST PURCHASED IT A FEW MONTHS AGO I really like this cleanser.  It cleans my face very well and I do not have trouble with the pores filling up I am starting to really love this product.  If you are like me and were using MD Forte cleanser (now discontinued) for 10+ years at the recommendation of your dermatologist, then you  will not be disappointed.  It has slight odd smell, not bad, just different.  It is a medium thickness clear gel and does not lather.  I have combination skin, oily around the mouth and have struggled with acne from the age of 11 to 29, now with hormonal acne mostly around the mouth and chin.  I could see how this could be a little drying for some, but you can always alternate days or rinse it quicker.  I was initally looking for a product similar to MD Forte, and chose this one because of the reviews and brand.  The same dermatologist that started me on MD Forte also sold Neocutis and I have been using their eye cream, skin cream, and day cream for approx. 5 years and love them.  Overall, I think it is a good substitute for MD.  Also, a LOT cheaper, which is strange considering how expensive the other Neocutis products are.  I am very pleased, for now :) Our dermatologist recommended this product and it works perfectly in removing blackheads. We were so pleased to find that Amazon carries this product line. It has also made my skin softer and has shrunk my pores. It is a wonderful product. no Great, exfoliating, non-harsh cleanser. I have been using this product for years now . My doctor of 13 years whom I highly trust recommended. Great product Have used this product for years; found it here at a reasonable price. Works exactly as advertised. Purchased was shipped quickly and its a great product, and half the price you pay in a med-spa or doctor's office. This product works great! My face feels very soft without drying it out. I'm on my 2nd bottle & will be buying more. I love this product and especially love that I can get it through Amazon. Great product.  I use it every evening and will continue ordering it. This product was recommended to me when I had a facial back in December.  I am in my early 40's and still struggle with oily skin, clogged pores and breakouts.  Since I started using it (in morning), I have noticed an amazing difference in my skin. Very few breakouts and pores seem smaller! I was so happy to find it on Amazon's website and recommend it to my friends.  It leaves your skin so soft! Used another brand of exfoliating cleanser (prescription brand product) for many years. Decided to try NeoCutis cleanser when I switched to other NeoCutis products. This cleanser exfoliates and leaves my face clear and smooth. Love it. If you have large pores, this is a go-to form your daily cleansing routine. I paid way too much at a dermatologist's office initially both have been buying it on Amazon ever since. It feels like it's not doing anything until you get a small cut on your face and then you feel the salicylic acid working. Use circular motion when in shower, rinse and moisturize after. Great for the over 40 club like me, especially the throat and decolletage areas. You won't be disappointed I use with my Clarisonic and my skin looks amazing ....I'm 62 and sometimes got tiny cysts......no more!  Much better than using stuff with  microbeads which are terrible for the environment !!!  An aesthetician recommended this along with the Claisonic.  She was right! A great facewash. I use this on my face every day in the shower, and will occasionally use it on my chest or back area if I feel I've been sweating frequently and could be in danger of the dreaded breakout. Please use a follow-up moisturizer on your face if you are using this product--it contains a light acid. I absolutely love this exfoliating cleanser. I have mature combination sensitive skin and I only use this 3 times a week. After I wash my face with this is feels smooth and it seems to help get all the dead flaky skin off. I notice I have less dry patches and my skin looks brighter. You need to avoid your eye area cause it can irritate your eyes. I have rosacea and this is the best (by far) cleanser that I have found that is gentle on my rosacea but yet truly cleanses my face and helps keep breakouts to a minimum and fights the aging process. I got this at my plastic surgeons office. He said it was too harsh for me to use as a cleanser (I normally use cetaphil and do not have an acne problem).He recommended using this as an exfoliator/chemical peel once a week. Apply on dry skin (after you wash with regular wash) then massage onto face and let stay on skin for about 15 minutes then wash off. It always leaves my skin feeling so smooth- it's like a mini facial in a bottle! Great product that I have used since last year.  It is very gentle on the skin and does an excellent job of gentle exfoliation without being harsh or abrasive.  My skin feels smooth and silky afterward.  I have acne rosacea and would highly recommend this product to anyone with hypersensitive, red toned skin. Oh how I love this product. It really cleans my skin and refines my pores. I highly recommend it! Best face wash! Have used it for a couple years. Exfoliates without over drying my face. I have sensitive skin and most exfoliating washes cause my skin to peel around my nose. Not this one! Love It! I just started to used this product and when I use it -it make my skin feel so clean-it is not harsh on your face-and it help hears acne scars as well.. Great wash, leaves face soft. I have sensitive skin and I have had no problems with this product. Will order again! excellent product.  outstanding customer service I really love this cleanser.  It has glycolic acid in it to help exfoliate and leaves my skin soft!"
B00BQ553QE," Okay, so I'll start this review off by saying, for all of the people who are complaining that this product doesn't work, everyone should know that despite the fact that we are at the height of technological advances and medicine, there is still actually no product that completely works in 24 hours. That's not even how your skin works, so there's no point in complaining about something that at this stage in the game, isn't actually possible.Now, that said, you can see results in 24 hours from using different facial cleansing systems in conjunction with a proper diet and lots of water. That's where this Acnefree kit comes in for me. I started using it, and I have definitely seen results. I use twice a week, after I use my absolute favorite mask,TreeActiv Anti Acne & Rosacea Treatment Sulfur Mask Plus Rhassoul, Bentonite Clay Mask with Witch Hazel & Aloe Vera - Refreshing Lemon Scent (1 Jar) (8 Oz), and I've really been seeing results.The mask serves as my acne fighting base, with the sulfur and tea tree working hard at attacking pimples that are under the surface, and fighting ones that have yet to crop up. It's also really good for evening out my complexion, eliminating my dark circles (dark circle elimination is a whole other post I'll have to write). I then use the Acnefree 24 hour clearing system which really helps with pimples that are already living on my face, shrinking them and reducing redness. It's really great for this purpose.I top it off with a little spot treatment with my TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution for Advanced Acne Treatment - All Natural Acne Spot Treatment - Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back! (60ml), which acts as an antibacterial, preventing more pimples from coming to the funeral of the ones shrinking. All in all, I definitely recommend the acne free product, I just think that it should be known that you should always use a few different products together rather than expect just one to solve all of your problems. I’ve been using this for a few weeks now and I’m very pleased with the results. I tend to break out along my jawline and neck. These products have helped to keep my skin clearer without over drying like some other products I’ve tried. One word - WORKS !! Perfect product! This always clears up my face much better than the sensitive kind. :) My 13-year old son uses this, as he is prone to acne. It works surprisingly quickly to clear up any current acne. His shows up mostly along his forehead and chin and this seems to be really effective (when he remembers to use it!). He uses all 3 steps with each wash. When I asked if his skin felt dry he said no. Pleasantly surprised! Worked great!  My daughter was having a real bad time with acne.  Took a month's worth of antibiotics and used this three step system and now it is much better.  No longer using antibiotics, just this three step system. Works great!  A lot less expensive than a similar product I was using. My son gets terrible acne on his forehead from the helmets he wears for football and lacrosse and we have tried everything.  Even ProActiv was no help.  So finding this product was a miracle.  I received a free sample from #Smiley360 and could see the difference almost immediately.  I have attached before and after pictures so you can clearly see how well it worked.  Of course, being a teen, he didn't even use it exactly as prescribed, so I can only assume it would look even better fi you actually followed all the directions.  I highly recommend this product. I've had acne for 2 full years now. I went through a variety of products- mainly an assortment of proactive products, and yet nothing had worked. Until now. I've been using this for 2 weeks now and my acne already went from moderate to mild. I cannot express enough how happy I am to have bought this product. When I break out I apply acnefree product same day and in less than 48 hours its barely noticeable. Acne that has been on my face for years has finally started to fade. From far away my acne is barely noticeable. I no longer feel embarrassed to leave the house. I love this product. Got this for Mom, and she loves it, says it's gentle to her skin. Thank you god for this product.  I have been suffering with acne on just one side of my face for about 4 years now and I'm 31 now. I have been using this product for for 1 year and I tell you it is a god send. My acne went away after the first week of using this product and the tone of my skin evened out. My skin is not sensitive but it is a little oily but this product helped control it. I work at a doctors office and our patients that come in tell me how good my skin looks and what I use and I tell them Acnefree 24, and recommend it to everyone to try. Thank you so much Acnefree for your awsome product. I have been using Proactiv for several years but did not like being locked into an automatic mailing schedule. I canceled my account (a real pain as they continued to attempt to convince me not to do so), bought my first Acnefree kit and have been very happy with the results. It keeps my skin clear and is not nearly as harsh as Proactiv. I bought this product at the Duane Reade around the corner from my house because the right side of my face decided ""Hey, forget the fact that you've been out of high school for seven years--let's break out like we're 17 all over again!"" It was AWFUL and, if I'm going to be brutally honest, I wanted nothing more than to rip my skin off. Instead, I decided to buy some acne medicine--I figured that would probably be the less painful option. I began to see results within the first day, and by the ninth day of use my skin was almost completely clear. I have some scarring from my high school years, but according to other reviews I've read, this should help fade those, as well. The directions say to use this twice a day (morning and evening), which I did at the beginning, but once my skin cleared I found that using it more than once a day or every other day made my skin burn and peel a bit. I've always had sensitive skin, though, so that might have something to do with it--your mileage may vary!I have only one caveat for this product, which is use a washcloth and pillowcases that you don't mind ruining while using this product. I dedicated a ratty old washcloth to dry my face with after washing with the cleanser, but I didn't think to use a crappy pillowcase and managed to bleach the heck out of it. Oops! I bought the Acnefree Severe kit a few years ago and tried it but it burned my face so I stopped using it.  A few years pass and I decide to try it again and I get the same reaction after the first couple uses; it burnt my face but this time I decided to just keep going on with the treatment and after a few days of the burned sensation it completely went away and my face felt great.  It has really cleared up my acne.  I get one or two spots now and then but nothing like I used to have.  I've tried just about every product you can think of and this is the best, you just have to stick with it and make sure to do it every morning and night. I thought that this was a great buy!  When my son was almost a year old and my skin was still a mess post-pregnancy, I was desperate.  Initially, I used the soap 2x a day and the toner, lotion 1x a day.  Within a few weeks, my skin was clear again.  I still have some of the lotion and toner left after 5 months and am using that 1x a day before bed.  When I am out, I will definitely purchase again. I've suffered from moderate to slightly severe acne for as long as I can remember and have tried pretty much everything out there you can imagine (including the other formulas from acnefree and proactiv itself). The only thing that has ever worked for me was the crazy prescription drug accutane that I took a few years ago. It was great and cleared up most of my acne but was so severely drying that I was happy to be done taking it. Just recently I started breaking out again and it was getting pretty bad, so much so that none of the store bought topical treatments had any effect. I was trying to get an appointment to see my doctor to get a referral to see a dermatologist but was not able to get one until 2 months from now! And once I get the referral it's usually even more difficult to get an appointment with the dermatologist so I probably would have had to wait a total of 3+ months which I just could not do. So frustrated, I saw this at the store and decided to give it a try being that I had nothing to lose at this point and am so happy I did! I've only been using it about 3 days and I can not express how happy I am! Something is actually working and it's working quite quickly. Yes, it is slightly drying but manageable, especially with the results it gives. ^_^NOTE: I also started using a 100% natural witch hazel toner (which is very inexpensive and also available at the same store I bought the sensitive formula acnefree products) at the same time. It is very gentle and completely non drying (not the greatest smelling product but I like the way it feels on my skin) and I've been using it alongside the sensitive acnefree products. I use this product all the time and I got a good deal through Amazon prime. I used this acne treatment a few times and was able to notice a different in my acne/pimples in just one use. It's a simple 3-step process, they don't leave any greasy feeling or residue on your face. There is no scent. The only downside for me is that it dried out my face, but I could still use it and make sure to apply moisturizer after use. Amazing product. Just used two day, I can see the difference. My 11 year old started having acne problems about a year ago.  All over her forehead, cheeks, nose and chin.  Bought her some acne wash and cream at Wal-Mart (don't remember the name), it didn't work.  We tried the Neutrogena SkinId system for her.  It was very expensive and made no difference.  I was hesitant to try Proactiv, because she is young and her skin is a little sensitive.  The reviews for Proactiv on thie site convinced me that was the right choice.  We have been very happy with AcneFree Sensitive so far.  She has been using it for about 6 weeks.  She still has a little acne on her forehead, but her cheeks, chin and nose are smooth and clear.  One of her complaints of the SkinId system was that it ""hurt her face"", she says this doesn't do that.  I do think when this runs out we will try the regular version to see if that can help wipe out the rest of the acne on her forehead.  But I think when someone with sensitive skin is starting this program it is smart to start with the lower concentration first. Works great... but it turned my hairline blonde... For me this works better than proactive xout which i have been ùsing for years and only got little results... i love this product my face decent going through puberty at almost thirty years old and it snowed in my face . i used to always get huge painful zits along my chin and like the sides where my sideburns grow and occasionally zits on my cheeks . i tried proactive first it didn’t really work so i found this kit at target and started using it . it did the job and then some . my face is getting back to normal This is a great product. I used it as directed and within two days my skin was clear. I do agree with other reviewers--it would be nice to be able to purchase items separately as they do not all ""end"" at the same time. The moisturizing gets used up first even though it only takes a tiny bit to do its job. This is great for people who have sensitive skin, while also being acne prone. It has a slight smell to it, but it is very subtle. While is has sacylic acid in it, I personally have not had any issues with it over drying my skin. Any acne product typically has the sacylic to dry out the blemishes. This line contains the face wash, the moisturizer, and the acne spot treatment for blemishes. My favorite stuff, only acne treatment that has EVER worked for me! Very concerned it's hard to find now... discontinued maybe? The regular strength formula burns more but still works. This is a great set.  The face cleanser and spot treatment are my favorite!  I totally agree this product is gentile and effective.  It is very reasonably priced too!Does it work?  Yes, absolutely.  I would say this product is very helpful in reducing/eliminating acne.  I am very happy with this product and would highly recommend it. Ive tried all kinds of acne products even the other skin products made by this company. They where to harsh on my skin. Within a week of using this line my skin cleared and my skin tone evened out. Ill never use anything else. But remeber eveyones skin is diff. Try drinking plenty of water and put a little lemon in ot to help. Had problems with acne for a couple years, tried several products and methods and nothing worked until this. I now have no acne at all, it's a miracle product. I got this as a member of Smiley360 for free to try and had my 17 year old try is as he has the most acne.  The results were great .  his skin always has a very oily look to it but after using AcneFree 24.  Feel of his skin and the wonderful reaction of the acne disappearing was great and made him feel a lot better about himself .  It was easy for him to use and will use it again. Thank you so much!!!!!!!! ive always battled with acne and Ive used proactiv in the past BUT when I started using this stuff I noticed my skin was crystal clear and pimple free. I started receiving compliments on my skin which was MAJOR and was asked my regimen. wow. I couldn't believe my skin could get this clear and I realized it was contributed to acne free!! I prefer this over proactiv as its less irritating and no one ever complimented my skin before using this. I sleep with acnefree overnight AND wash 2-3xs a day for THE BEST results. I would recommend this product. You have to keep using it or else the acne will come back. worked great, cheaper than pro-active Works well. Less than half the price at drugstore store. I really am happy with this AcneFree product.  Both my son and daughter are using the system and I have seen marked changes in both of their skin.  The blemishes have cleared significantly and their skin just does not seem to be as oily.""I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own."" My daughter has tried multiple different Acne products however nothing ever really works. Until AcneFree that is! This started working immediately and within just a few days we could see a real difference. And it didn't dry her skin like so many other product have. We will be AcneFree customers for a long time.I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. Great on my face. Comparable to proactive. The only thing that i've found that actually works on my severely oily, adult acne skin.  I've tried so many different products.  My routine is a makeup remover wipe, Noxema, Dr. Sponge , Witch Hazel as an astringent a few times per week and then this stuff.  I know it sounds like a lot, but I've never had skin this oily with so much acne before - and I'm in my 30s.  I  also use a clay mask 1 - 2 per week.  I like Dr. Jart Pore Clarifying Mask and Marcelle clay mask.No, I dont work for any of these companies or any beauty supply or salon.  Just sharing what I finally found works for me after years of trying different products I just started using this product.  I have been using Proactiv and Proactiv+; however, I find it hard to pay so much for these skin care products($80).  I got this Acnefree kit for $7! You cannot beat that price.  In stores it usually runs about $20.  This acne kit seems to be working well for me, just as well as proactiv.  It helps prevent breakouts and also rid of existing acne. I have been using this product for about a week or so, once in the morning and once at night before bed. I have seen a BIG difference in my skin. I had pimps that were huge, reduce in size after the second use and it disappeared after continued use. I also had brown circular marks left after picking my skin trying to speed up the process to remove the pimps from my face, but now it's clearing up. It is almost gone! I am so happy I found this product. I actually bought my product from Walmart for $14.95, I saw the reviews on amazon and decided to try it. I am glad I did. I will definitely keep this as a staple in my skin care regimen. Works EXACTLY like Proactiv, at a 1/3rd the price.  What's not to like?  If you use this stuff religiously, as directed, you won't have acne.  I've been using the Proactiv kits since my high school days, and they always worked, but I'm tired of paying upwards of $35/month.  Some of the other acne kits like Clean & Clear, Neutrogena, etc. just don't cut it.  Their formulations aren't the same.  This kit is pretty much a perfect copy of the Proactiv system.  Now that I've discovered it, I'm not going back anytime soon.The only negative I have is that it does contain parabens, but so does original Proactiv so I'm not all that shocked.  Nobody knows for sure if these compounds are truly bad for humans or not, but I'm not all that concerned. This is the only thing that helps keep my husbands skin clear. It works much better then proactive and is a third of the cost! I love this product. It is perfect for my sensitive skin. Compared to proactive, this product works just the same, plus it is a lot cheaper. I buy it every 60 days. I just bought this system last night, and decided to wait till this morning to use it. I was pleasantly surprised; After using all three steps, I noticed my blackheads were surfacing. That's a good thing to me because they're easier to extract; no pushing and prodding is needed (I use a metal extractor). I have eczema and this hasn't made me face really dry, but I suppose there's still time for that. I think even f it does dry my face out I will still use it. There are other lotions out there you could use in addition with this.All in all, I really do like it. I'll update after a few weeks to see if anything has changed. My adult acne was becoming embarrassing and frustrating.  This product worked quickly and I did not suffer any skin irritations from it either, because I have super sensitive skin.  I love this product and recommend others use it as well. Came in and first day I started using it I'm only on day 4 of using it and you can already see a better difference Excellent! This system made a big difference for me.  I wish I had known about this when I was in high school!  I'm one of those lucky adults that still has acne.  Blackheads and every morning I'd wake up with 7-10 little whiteheads.  The change using these products was quick!  No more whiteheads, my pores are actually clear of gunk!  I'm so happy with these products.  They recommend using the products twice a day, but they do warn that dryness can occur.  That did happen for me around my eyes, so I just use my regular moisturizer there and I'm good to go! This really works and the price is amazing! I'm 28 years old and for the past couple years have developed moderate acne along my jawline and around my mouth. I've never had a problem with acne until now and have tried just about every combination of cleansers, lotions, etc. I recently purchased the Proactiv 3-step kit. I used it for two weeks and saw very little improvement in both redness and breakouts. I saw this kit in Wal-Mart earlier this week and decided to give it a try, knowing if it worked, it would save me a significant amount of money.BEST DECISION EVER.I'm on day 5 of using this kit and I've already noticed a tremendous improvement in my skin. The redness on my cheeks has lessened, and where I used to have anywhere from 2-3 swollen, irritated acne bumps on one of them at any given time, my left cheek (the problem one) is almost smooth to the touch! I'm still waiting to see how it will fare during that time of the month, when my breakouts are worse, but it's already doing MUCH better than Proactiv.It does dry the skin out, but only slightly. I use the cleanser only at night, and the toner and lotion twice per day. The lotion doesn't fare well as an actual moisturizer, so I've applied it all over at night and in the morning, I've been treating only the problem areas and then applying an additional moisturizer to the rest of my face before putting on makeup. Also, the lotion that comes in this kit STINKS. That's about it's only downfall. I bought instead of Proactiv, and it works so well and is CHEAP! GOOD VALUE, GOOD PRODUCT After 8 years of regular use, it has become a little less effective, although that's easily attributable to other hormonal factors in my life that have changed. I still use it religiously because I find that my skin does indeed break out as much as it did before I started using this product within a week of non-use (vacations, camping, etc). When I began to use this stuff, my skin looked terrible -- red and chapped -- for about two weeks. I reduced my usage to once a day and it all cleared up, as did my skin. It was a miracle. Now, combined with the Acnefree Terminator 10%, my skin is back to flawless! Every bit as good as Pro Active! I was able to try this out with Smiley360 for free and I'm quite glad I did! I've had acne since I was little and nothing has ever helped me before, I've tried everything from OTC acne cleansers, foams, scrubs to prescription medication and nothing helped long term. It all always worked for a few days and then I'd start getting my acne back again. I started using this a month ago and after a week I noticed results starting to happen and after 2 weeks my face was absolutely clear, not one simple pimple was on my face, I was astonished! I missed a week because I had been working and just couldn't find the time and to my surprise, my acne didn't come back. I've gone back to using it again only because it's starting to get humid out and I don't want to press my luck but all in all, I couldn't be any happier with AcneFree! I have suffered of mild acne through all my life and I have tried so many products. Some have been prescribed and very pricey. This one has help me significantly. I have always had blackhead and breakouts and AcneFree has diminished them a lot. I noticed that my skin color in getting even and the texture smoother since the blackheads and whiteheads made me looked as if I had Melasma.It has not cleared my skin completely but I will try the severe one to see how it works. Let me start off by saying that i was a little skeptical about this product because one i have never heard of it before and two i wasn't sure about buying anything that can seriously treat acne out of my local drugstore. I'm 36 years old and have had mild to moderate acne since about the age of about 27. I have always had some form of acne being just small breakouts to damn near cystic modules underneath the skin, well the day i visited the Walgreens, i was having a full blown acne attack, and i mostly get it smack dap on my jaw and jawline, not really get breakouts anywhere else, so anyways i stood there and determined which yet fail product i was gonna buy and take home, so i picked this one and the sales lady assured me i can bring it back if it didn't work for me, my first experience was it was very drying and i figured oh im not gonna be able to use this every morning and night,by the third day i said well it is making the breakout smaller,so i decided give it a chance and use it as directed and see what happens, now im at 1 week and 1 day and i have to say this has now become my HG! this has completely changed my face,even though i grabbed the AcneFree Sensitive, and at the time my face was so bad i could have gotten the Severe, but i didn't know how my skin would react to it. My breakouts are almost completely dried up and gone and i will not use anything else for my acne. I have being using the Proactive green tea moisturizer when my face feels a little dry, but i have never have anything work so well and i especially love the price and that i can get it from my local drugstore or walmart, so thats my review. I hope it was helpful. I absolutely love the AcneFree® 24 Hour Acne Clearing System! It's a lot cheaper than Proactive but I feel like it works just as well with its 3 step system. It was a little bothersome for me to use a 3 step process at first because I was feeling a little lazy about it. I had a wash my face, put on the toner, and then the lotion. Eventually I got used to the process and it became a routine for me. The difference on my acne-prone face was AMAZING. Within 2 weeks of use, my skin was less acne-prone and current breakouts were reduced. I did not have any skin irritations from using these products.I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. Awesome system. Works better then anything I have tried. works great!!!! My daughter and I have been trying AcneFree for the past month. After the first few days we both felt our skin was a lot softer. She is 13 and had been starting to get breakouts in her T zone. The older ones that had left minor marks went away and the ones that had been forming started disappearing. I had red marks from skin irritation from the heat and it helped clear that as well.  This is a great product and a great price. Other systems we used didn't help much and offered little improvement. This one is a must have.I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I have been using AcneFree for about 3 months now and it works great! At first I thought ""It'll probably be like all the rest of the acne products out there that claim to clear acne overnight."" After 2 weeks using this, I take back my earlier thought. The cleanser doesn't smell that bad and it's really smooth on the skin. The moisturizer was good, I just prefer not to use it. Here comes the best part, the terminator. I think it's fair to call the terminator pure genius when it comes to clearing pimples. It doesn't clear your pimple overnight because no product can do that, but it definitely makes it hardly noticeable! 2 days with the terminator and I guarantee that pimple will be gone. I have had acne for about 5 years. I am 18 so everyone knows how much you breakout in your teens. My face was cleared within 3 months. I rarely breakout now, because I'm using AcneFree every other day. Oh and that statement on the box claiming that it's better than ProActive? It's TRUE. I back AcneFree 100% on that one. Definitely buy this product if you are having trouble with acne. Excellent! I gifted this to a friend who has an acne prone skin .. & she loves it !! Absolutely love this product! Starting using it for about a year now and my face is completely clear and I've never been happier to not have to worry about acne all over my face ! Only problem is the sensitive version is no longer sold In any stores near me :(. Good product and good price. I tried proactiv and this is actully better.  I have very oily skin and this definitely keeps the oil in check without drying out my face.  I have to admit I only do it once per day (supposed to be done twice) but once has been enough to keep the pimples away.  The size is also great, bottles are bigger than you get with proactiv.  I would absolutely recommend this item 100% Best at clearing acne. Period! I been using this for years and i only use it whenever another product i used break out my face and this always work perfect for me and clear up the bumps within two days..they recently changed this product from using the benzoyl peroxide to now using the salicylic acid ingredient and this new ingredient  doesn't work great for me like the one with the benzoyl peroxide did..but this one right here is the good one that works superfast..but im assuming they may still sell both products with the different ingredients. Amazing! 10stars!I only use the product once a day in fear of drying out my skin. Since I have had two children and breast fed both of them my skin has broken out terribly. This product after one application noticeably lowered the signs of acne and after less than 2 weeks it is almost completely gone. I highly recommend this product to everyone. works really good thanks. I originally bought this for my teenage son and saughter, but ended up trying it myself as well.  I am almost 40 and suffer from occasional breakouts.  I've been using this system for a few weeks and the breakouts have stopped and my skin is clear, amazing!  My son and daughter are having excellent results as well.  My daughter has very sensitive skin, so she just uses it once a day.  All in all, a great product. My son is 15 and he has facial acne that most over the counter products hasn't work well on.  He was motivated to try the AcneFree® 24 Hour Acne Clearing System and it is working for him!  His bumps are clearing up and he will continue to use this system since it works for him!I have received a free product for the purpose of my review. All of these opinions are 100% my own. I must have used at least 30 different acne washes, creams, and medications over the past ten years. I tried using a Benzoyl Peroxide cream in the past and it irritated my skin and only slightly helped with my acne so I was skeptical to try this wash even though it had good reviews.Well, I don't know if its this brand or just that it is not the cream version, but this wash not only does not irritate my skin but my face has also cleared up almost completely.I've been using this system in conjunction with Acne Treatment Supplement: Top Rated Acne Pills for Women, Men, and Teens - 29 Powerful Acne Fighting Ingredients ...which are just pills you take everyday for overall skin health, and this is literally the best my skin has looked in agesI'd suggest everyone with acne prone skin keep these products in their cabinet at home.  They've worked for me, hopefully they can work for you too! I used this in my mid-late 20's.  It was an effective system for my acne prone, combination skin.  I purchased this product for my 14 year old niece.  Her skin seems to be following the same path as mine did.  I'm hoping this will work for her and keep her from suffering the many acne scars I have. oh yes, this product is absolutely great for sensitive skin people with acne problems. the product is not harsh to your skin. you don't have to worry about your skin drying out too much, its a whole set! u apply the cleanser, the toner and then the lotion. and it all balances out. it cleans and hydrates your skin properly. i have also bought their cleansing brush which is a great help.In the end i would just want to say that nothing will work like a magic wand. the trick is to be consistent. u haver to be regular with it for atlas 2,3 weeks to see a clear difference in your skin. Love Acnefree!  I've been using it for years, it's the only thing that helps my skin!  Tried going back to expensive products after this cleared my skin and I had to come back!!  Thank you Acnefree! This product has really helped my daughters face. She has been using it for a few days now and there is a noticeable difference. I can also tell that her self esteem is much higher. It works really well, we have tried the other one and this one works a lot better for sensitive skin. I got this AcneFree product in the mail for free to test out! I have to say it really works for me, and i recommend it to others to use on their faces as well. I'm a 23 year old female. For the last several months, I had been dealing with breakouts along my forehead and hairline. I have always had an issue with noticeable blackheads along my nose and chin, too. I feel like I have tried every product on the planet. I had been using the Neutrogena 360 product line. It worked well for a while, until it just quit. So, then I switched to an all-natural product thinking the SLS in my regular face wash was causing the breakouts.  The ""all natural"" product didn't help. At. All.So, one day when I was searching for Proactiv on prime, I found AcneFree. Since the reviews were good and the price was decent, I thought ""well, shucks. Why not? It's not like it can make it that much worse."" And people, let me tell you! I noticed a difference after two days of using this!! My blackheads on my nose weren't as noticeable and while my forehead was still broke out, there weren't any new bumps that had popped up!I followed the directions on the bottle that said to wash your face twice a day in it.  My face itched so badly when I did a wash twice a day, so I cut back to just once in the morning. My skin looks pretty daggone good right now (I'm sure when I post this, something will happen and I'll break out tomorrow or something). My mother even commented on it this morning, which is why I was compelled to write this post.I switch between using the lotion that came in the box and using a lotion I already had. I find that if I use the AcneFree lotion several days in a row, my face just feels... sticky?Just get on with it and buy this product. You'll be glad you did. excellent Works great! I'm always skeptical of trying new acne systems. I don't have super sensitive skin, but products in the past have definitely irritated my face by making dry patches or increasing redness. I didn't have any of those problems with this AcneFree system. When I first began using it, I didn't see a difference right away and the moisturizer seemed to give my skin a weird texture, so I was initially disappointed. However, I started using just the cleanser for a little while and within two weeks started using the moisturizer as well and it has worked great since then. My experience leads me to believe that skin might have an adjustment period when you first start using the system but eventually, your skin will hopefully get used to it. I also found that it needs to be used daily, sometimes more than once, as the package advises. Early on, I (stupidly) ignored the directions and would only use it occasionally and the results were mixed. Since I started using it (cleanser and moisturizer), it's been much more effective. Obvious, maybe, but it may explain why people aren't having great results.  My one criticism is the fact that the moisturizer and the Spot Treatment definitely stain fabrics. I've had to switch out my expensive sheets for cheaper ones because I use it at night but it's a small trade-off in my opinion. ok =) I've tried proactiv on and off with always the same results.  At first proactiv works then after a month it looses it's effectiveness.  This system on the other hand has both salicylic acid (SA) and 3% benzoyl peroxide (BP) unlike proactiv's 2.5% BP and no SA.  Slightly more for those who need the stronger medicine.  I've been using this system twice a day for the past 4 months and my face has never been clearer!  Occasionally I'll get one or two spots but never a full on breakout.  But no OTC system can fully cure acne 100%.Word of caution, if your face is not used to BP, it can dry your skin out.  If you use this system, MAKE SURE you put on a layer of non-greasy facial moisturizer afterwards and you'll be good to go.  I use gold bond ultimate healding and it works great.  At first it seems counterintuitive to use moisturizer for oil prone skin but trust me, the combination of BP plus moisturizer will kill the P. acne bacteria and mitigate the effects of dry skin.  If you don't use a moisturizer, you will dry out and you will be in worse shape than it was with the acne!  (Speaking from experience) Acne.org is a big proponent of moisturizer as well.Otherwise, a great product and you don't have to sign up for some lame order by mail subscription! I've been waiting until after the first week to review this, and I've got to say, I love my skin finally! I didn't have severe acene, but it was noticeable and uncomfortable. It's been clear since about after day 4, and has such greater value over proactive. I will continue buying this!! Have you ever asked yourself ""Why do I get acne breakouts every now and then at this age?"" then buy this stuff. Just buy it and pour over your face.Just do it. Perfect! This is maybe the only product that works for our child. Her face has been clearer then ever since she started it. Took about a week to clear up but once it did she was good. Great product! Fast shipping! Thank you! A+ I have mild to moderate acne plus dry, sensitive skin. This acne system works very well for me. My skin is a touch dry since starting this system, but isn't as prone to oiliness as it was before. My skin looks better than it has in months!. I've also tried Murad's acne system, and I think Acne Free delivers better results--at a fraction of the price! Also, A.F. is a three-step system, whereas Murad is four steps. I've notice my compliance has increased with A.F. simply because there are fewer steps to follow. I've suffered since my late 20's with acne and been to several dermatologists for it. Had some success, some failures. It is much better now that I'm in my early 50's. I had used the regular strength AcneFree and then decided to try this. Within a week I had perfectly clear skin and it's stayed that way. Now I feel confident that I can have some minor cosmetic procedures to repair some of the damage done to my skin over the years. This is better than anything, even most prescription meds I've used. In fact I quit taking my antibiotic and my skin broke out. Used this, and all clear. Great acne treatment and prevention for the face. Worked better for me than Proactive and was even cheaper! I have sensitive skin and this caused a little drying but did not cause any sort of peeling. After a few applications my skin got used to it and I did not have any issues, great for  outbreaks when you have sensitive skin. I have had moderate acne ( at times severe) since I was 13- I'm now 32.  I have tried Proactiv (didn't work for me), prescription retinol products (didn't work) and this worked for me! I have been using it for a month now. I have very fair and sensitive skin, but this product didn't irritate it.  I have also had some success with birth control pills (Orthotricyclen-Lo) at controlling my breakouts.  This product does NOT address scars, so if you have red spots or skin texture problems, that will require another course of action.  You have to use this product every day or it won't work so well.  If you have sensitive skin, using once at night is best, and a sun screen SPF 15 and higher is good (I like Olay Complete Sensitive). For me, the best part is that this product is fairly priced and available at your local CVS, Target, or Walgreens. Like with any product, if this doesn't work for you, keep trying.  Everyone is different, but there's always hope. Pros:-Cheap-The best acne clearing system I have every tried-Not too harshCons:-really hard to find in CanadaI'm a guy and I've had pretty bad acne since I was 9 and I had tried everything to try to get rid of it. I used different cleansers and creams with Benzoyl Peroxide and Salicylic acid from tons of different brands, and none of them did anything. While on vacation I couldn't find my normal brand so I decided for $14 I should try it. I really didn't have any hope for this when I bought it, I just needed something which would try to prevent more acne and this was the cheapest form of Benzoyl Peroxide available.Boy was I surprised when most of my acne disappeared in the next 2 weeks. I thought that my hormones may have re balanced or maybe it was the different atmosphere in California. I completely overlooked Acnefree as the solution to my problem and promptly stopped using it. And my acne came back. By this time I returned back to Canada and I could not find Acnefree anywhere in stores, but thankfully it was available on amazon.com and they just happened to ship to Canada. I have used this for about 2 months now, and most of my acne has cleared.I used to have some acne scars on my cheeks and they are almost none existent now. I really love the toner, I as a guy always thought toners were for girls and I refused to use it until I had to. It is really gentle on the skin and cleans the skin really well, like so well that when I finished using it the cotton pad shows all the extra impurities the cleanser didn't pick up. After I started using the toner every day my face became smoother and smoother. I checked the ingredients on the back and it had an Alpha Hydroxy Acid which is really good at making the skin soft and smooth. After the first couple of days my skin felt more smoother than it had ever been before in my life.Cleanser or repair cream work alright, and have benzoyl peroxide which kills acne bacteria. The cream is twice the size of other brands so it lasts a while and I can use it on my back and chest so its useful.I skipped some days when using this when so my results aren't the best as they could be but still this product blew me away. I will try to use this more regularly and will update if my acne completely disappears. Best price ever! I love this product! best stuff ever Works great. I have been using this product for 7 months now and I plan to keep using it. I have tried every kind of skin care you can think of for the past 10 years and nothing has worked like this kit has. I have very oily skin that is prone to redness and patches of dryness (while still being oily).It hasn't gotten rid of my acne entirely, but it is noticeably better.I ran out of the first two steps (cleanser and toner) after 5 or 6 months, so I do wish there was a way to only buy the steps you need because, at this rate, I am going to end up with a collection of  unused steps 3 and 4. I am impressed it lasts so long though, you really don't need to use a lot. I use maybe a dime size amount of the cleanser, just enough of the toner to wet  a cotton ball, and only small dabs of the last two (less than the size of a pea).If you have very sensitive skin or aren't used to using products with benzoyl peroxide in them, this may be a bit irritating to use. (I think they do have a sensitive skin formula, I haven't tried it). I've been using benzoyl peroxide for years and this doesn't bother me except around my temples so I just don't use it there. Just a side note, the benxoyl peroxide WILL STAIN EVERYTHING so be careful with it. Use a towel you don't mind turning orange and rinse very thoroughly. If you're like me, you may also be better off using this product shirtless as to not get any on your shirt either.I strongly suggest using a moisturizer after each time you use this product, especially one with SPF. This is my favorite: http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IJ1PBK/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1 excelllent trreatment! My daughter is 13 and is starting to get hormonal acne. She has been using it for 3 days and I can already tell a difference. Her chin used to be really red and bumpy and all of the pimples have started to dry out and are healing. We will continue to use this product!! No more acne for my teenage son. This product works and it works fast. So happy I am able to help with his complexion. I have been using this for a week now and had the first couple days where my face felt dry, but now i'm starting to notice my skin is a little bit clearer. I used to use proactive and stopped because it was ruining my pillow cases, but so far my pillow cases are good! I’m really happy with this product!  I suffer from hormonal acne on my chin area and this product helped clear up 3 large, deep pimples within about 3 days, in addition to making the rest of my face look clear and smooth.  I added a gentle exfoliating scrub b/c it has caused some minor dryness, but other than that I’m completely happy with this product and I’ll continue to use it! I started The AcneFree Sensitive Skin Acne System a few days ago and am very pleased to say that this is the product for me! Wow did I notice a difference just after one day of use, not only has the redness of my skin gone down but this is also the first acne product that contains benzoyl peroxide that has not caused bad irritation to my skin. I am 14 and suffer from hormonal acne, and have tried everything from very sensitive products like cetaphil to commercial products such as proactive, and even went to a dermatologist and was prescribed with epiduo. But I did not get nearly as great results from those products as I did with the AcneFree 24 Hour Clearing System. And I really love the feeling of this product because not only do these products smell great but they also feel great on my skin but they are also very affordable! A couple of things to remember is that because of the benzoyl peroxide you may experience some mild irritation such as an itch here and there but should not experience severe irritation. I chose the gentle system for my skin because it only has one step with the benzoyl peroxide. I suggest building a tolerance to any acne products with benzoyl peroxide by doing it once a day or every other day. As far as applying the Acne Repair Lotion (Step 3)you should not use your fingers to apply the application to your face, instead use less than a pea size amount on (1) Your Forehead (2) Your Chin (3 & 4) Your cheeks, and apply with the side of the palm of your hand in an outward motion. Doing so will prevent excessive irritation. Well wish you all luck and hope this helped!! <3 I have used this for years. about 15 years ago i went to dermatologists and would do chemical peels and ""witch hazel"" and a prescription Retinal.Once pro active came out i started using that and it worked very well! it is expensive though - so then i tried this, just to see. Works 100% as well as pro active. Follow the directions. use it everyday and you will be good. I have no acne at all. If i dont use any system at all, it takes about 2 weeks and i will start to get a pimple here and there. I had tried everything to get rid of my hormonal acne. I'm 41 and have had acne off and one since puberty. This system worked faster than anything I have tried.  In 3 days, my face was MUCH better and in 5 days it was 50% clear. So happy I received this for free Smiley360 for review....I will be buying it from now on. I have always had issues with acne. I heard great stuff about this and so far so good!! It is so nice to not break out! I've used A LOT of different cleansers for my mild acne. I decided to try this acne system based off the good reviews. It really works wonders for my skin. Nothing else gets rid of the blackheads and blemishes like this does. I will keep buying forever! This is the only face wash I use anymore. Helps control all my breakouts without drying my face out. Im really bad about using all 3 products, twice a day, as it says. Most of the time I only use the wash in the shower, even with just that, my face has cleared up SO much! It's already clearing my skin and emptying my pores out! I was shopping about a month ago at my local Dollar Tree, when I noticed they had this there. I purchased two. Boy am I kicking myself. THIS IS THE ONLY THING THAT HAS WORKED!! WHILE I AM ALSO POSITIVE PROACTIVE would be as effective its far too expensive. I highly suggest trying it. At $1 each kit  I'm mad I didn't buy them all. But I wasn't sure it would work. This product works amazingly well!! Honestly, I've delt with so many useless and expensive products claiming to rid you of acne forever, however as you too might have experienced NONE of them work! Even magic tea rituals and granola galore didnt work. I was hopeless, while my skin was having a civil war I was left embarrassed and ashamed.Until this magical creation.AcneFree really works it clears acne without any discomfort, and it leaves your skin feeling silky soft. I started to see results in the middle of the second week, though if you get this product it'll probly happen faster because of the severity of my acne. Not to mention the sweetness of the price tag! I used proactive for a while but saw no results so stopped and slightly because of the price tag. AcneFree worked way better and way faster with a much nicer price.The only complaint I would have is that once every month, around "" that time of the month "", my acne will get pretty bad, but it clears within a few days while using AcneFree. One other bad experience on the third week of using and I began to peel terribly around my mouth, so I redused the medication to once a day and avoided my mouth, that cleared it up neatly. And recently I began doing full face once a day and no problems. There is an issue that I didn't face and it's bleach stains. Most people say that their favorite shirts and pillows got bleached from this prodct but no such thing happened to me, but be careful anyway.In short I recommend this product to anyone who has struggled with acne and really wants them gone for good.P.S. After most of your acne is gone I suggest using only once a day or every other day Honestly I don't buy this from Amazon I usually get it at the pharmacy but this really really works wonders I must say if you having issue with acne and have tried a lot of things this would be your life saver, I tried a lot even proactive and I know many people will say this drys your face it's because you have to use sunscreen when using this product and you only have to use it three times a day as this is how I keep my skin looking super healthy! I have a schedule now that I have to wash my face three times a day and haven't had a big or like extremely nasty looking pimple FI have been using this for my acne for years. I tried and still am trying everything...waiting on the rosehip seed oil as I am writing this. I do peels both lactic and glycolic you name it I have it in my bathrooms. YES I do mean both bathrooms are full of lotions and potions. I  tried proactive...it didn't work. I had to return it. Other products work for a bit bit never am I acne free.except when I use this 3 step treatment. I saw this on Amazon for almost 9 dollars and was thrilled. I am used to paying almost 20 at Wal-Mart. I was just getting ready to ask my husband to get this kit on his way home from work and here it is on Amazon for an Amazing price. I don't know why this particular kit works so well to completely banish my acne. When using this product I have not even a one blemish!! I used coconut oil. All the rage right now for acne prone skin...Not mine!! I don't even want to leave the house. My skin went nuts. I got my kit yesterday. I pretty much ripped into it and used it immediately. I had a major breakout today my skin looks so much better. The tiny bumps are gone. I know from using this that by day 3 my acne will be banished. I used retin a and the side effects are awful. Dry flaky skin ect. I had to stop using all my.acne products when I became pregnant. Now that my little guy is here I can use this kit and my retin a for an eye wrinkle cream. I know everyones skin is different but give this a try for moderate acne. It really works!!! I love Acne free!!  It even keeps my cystic acne away. So I am a huge fan!"
B00479FP4Q," Lost the convenience and the price. These provide an all-over clean, and do a decent job removing make up, including stubborn mascara. They lather up fast with a minimal amount of water and are sturdy enough to really wash like a wash-cloth. The lather is creamy, just what you would expect from Olay. I think these are great to toss in your gym bag for a quick cleanse after working out, and are excellent to travel with (liquid-free means TSA friendly!). Good facial cleaners. Soft but very effective in removing makeup Not as hard as the ones with the 'blue' granules. These are more gentle. They lather well and once rinsed they will remove the remains of the lather and makeup. Will buy again I love these!  Especially great for travel.  Keeps my skin clean and clear.  No black mascara on my washcloths.  No breakouts from mystery soaps.  Does not burn the eyes. Love this product. Does what it's supposed to. I used to use these all the time, but had to drastically cut my cost of living. I decided to splurge a little and treat myself with these. I had forgotten how much I liked these. They lather nicely. I have noticed my brown spots fading. After I wash my face I can wipe out the sink before I toss it. I love these, they were a bit big so i cut them in half but they make your face feel super clean and removes even waterproof makeup. My only thing is that it does sting my eyes a bit but other than that i love these ADDED TO THE REST OF MY OLAY PRODUCTS, THESE ARE GREAT.  JUST ADD WATER AND THEY FOAM UP GREAT.  A LITTLE COURSE FOR A DEEP CLEANING EXPERIENCE.. Bought these on a whim and actually really like them! Was planning to buy regular make up wipes but thought I'd give these a try. I work really, really early mornings and sometimes after I get to work my face will feel gross. With these being dry I don't have to worry about them adding weight or drying out in my purse. It is less convenient to have to wash it off, but it makes me feel more refreshed and clean than regular make up wipes and I feel like my skin looks a lot healthier after I use them. LOVE these facial cleansing pads. They are so easy to use and do a great job of cleansing my face. I take them with me to the gym, and use them each morning and night. They totally changed my facial cleansing routine. These are great for traveling - no mess and they do a thorough job of removing all makeup.  I don't use waterproof mascara. I am obsessed with these! Love the texture, the way they gently scrub my face and the smell. I am sold on these forever. I have ultra sensitive skin and these work perfectly! My face is never dry after I use them and I do not see myself using anything else for a long time. Love these. Use nothing else on my face. Have used them for several years. Wish you could get them in the 3 pack again. I've used Olay products since I was a young woman and I feel that it is one of the very best, especially for the cost. Love love love.  They are great for morning face wash with no harsh brushing.The ease and convince can't be beat My skin is oily and washing with these every day has helped a lot!  Would recommend and will be purchasing again. I love these little ""wash cloth"" wipes. They do a great job of cleaning my face and are very convenient. I hate packing face wash for one night business trips. Olay saves the day every time. This particular formula is hard to find in stores too Use these on a daily basis.  I switch between Normal or Combination depending on the season and the weather.  I live in Chicago and the weather and environment can play havoc with my skin.  I love the way these cloths are so sturdy and do not fall  apart if I have to scrub makeup off.  I have been using these for years! Love them!  Love the convenience of them! Use only these on my face and at 74 have few wrinkles.  They are fantastic for traveling.  Take a few or take a lot...no special packaging is needed.  Can't do without them. I've always had acne my entire life. As I got older, I noticed it would come and go depending on how stressed I was. I went to the Clinique store and talked to the lady about my issues. She asked me what products I use to wash my face and I told her I clean it with the Cetaphil daily cleanser, then use the L'Oreal toner, and finish off with a moisturizer. She told me that the Cetaphil daily cleaner only takes off the dirt and oils, not your makeup. I seriously had a revelation because I had no idea I wasn't getting my makeup off my face all these years. I purchased these facial cloths, cut them in half with some scissors so they lasted longer, and immediately noticed the difference. All those small ingrown zits/bumps are gone and my skin looks amazing. I use these facial cloths to get my makeup off, then the cleanser, toner and moisturizer. Just so you know, the cloths do not dry your skin out either. I'm 27 years old and finally don't have to worry about my acne. Thank goodness...it's about time. I use these often- it's so convenient to order this product on Amazon!  Decent deal too. These cloths are super convenient for traveling. All you have to do is wet them and wash and your face feels like new again. I ride my bike to work so I keep these in the office to wash when I get in. I love not having to worry about keeping a bottle of soap around. They are pricey compared to bottled cleanser, but since I don't use them everyday, it's worth it to me. These are by far the best facial cleanser cloths I've found.  They suds up very well and do a good job of removing makeup, oily residue, and even ""face paint"".  They're also gentle to the skin and non-drying.  We all use them and recommend them highly. My favorite! Can't find in the store so I buy here! The wipes are so big I cut them in half and I get more fornmy money! love these!  just add water and they remove all makeup without drying your skin I have been using these cleansing pads for years.  They are super for gently removing makeup and oils.  If you need to lightly exfoliate you just rub a bit harder on those areas.  They rinse clean and then can be used as a rinsing cloth.  So convenient and disposable. I love these, they are not pre moistened, you have to wet them, but that's what I love about them because they are great for travel and I travel often.  Perfect for at the end of the day, which is my main use, at night to remove my make up and I love my make up!  What I love about them is that you can take them anywhere and they really feel like they are cleaning your face, I like that.  I put them in little Ziploc bags so they don't get dirty out accidentally wet, they are a necessity for me and buying in bulk is great! This product works great. I am a little upset because it is not exactly what I wanted, I thought they were already moist wipes with no rinse off but that was my own fault for not reading the description entirely.Still used them, they work great, smell nice, I cut mine in half because it seems like a waste not to because the sheets are so big. Love the facial wipes and no better value than through Amazon.  Thank you. Olay 4-in-1 Daily Facial Cloths are the only product (aside from oil) that takes off all of my makeup, including waterproof eyeliner and mascara. They don't leave behind any residue or leave my skin feeling overly dry. They're also great for travel because you don't have to carry a bottle of face wash with you. The Olay Sensitive 4-In-1 Daily Facial Cloths, work just as well and I prefer them in the winter when my skin is more dry and sensitive. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Olay Daily Facials.  They leave my skin feeling clean, soft, and supple.  When you work the cloths into a lather, it is nice and foamy.  It doesn't dry my skin or leave it feeling tight.  It just feels RIGHT.  It's perfect for removing makeup, even mascara.About 2 years ago, I was using the Olay Daily Facials for Combination/Oily skin along with the Olay Complete Moisturizer for Combination/Oily skin.  I had always thought that I had oily skin and after trying these Olay products,  I thought I had finally found the perfect combination for my skin.  One day, the store was out of the Daily Facials for Combination/Oily.  I didn't want to make a special trip to another store, so I just purchased the ones for Normal skin to hold me over.  After the first use, I thought, ""THIS is how my skin should feel!""  So, come to find out I had been using the wrong products all along.  I also switched to the Complete Moisturizer for Normal skin.  I found a huge improvement in my skin after that.  No more slick oily patches on my forehead, nose, cheaks, and chin.  Now, I used them with the Total Effects moisturizer and my skin is even better.  This stuff is great!I recommend it mostly for young women in their teens to twenties who just need a good, everyday cleanser.I also love the subscribe and save option, here on Amazon.  I'm getting twice the product for just a little over half the cost.  The only problem is that I sometimes run out before I remember to order an extra shipment, otherwise, it's great! I've been using these cloths for many years and they keep my skin even-toned and breakout free.  When I run out or forget to use them my skin begins to misbehave.  I know taught my teenage son to use these and they work on his skin too.  I can tell by just looking at his face whether he used them or not. My skin is extremely sensitive to skin, often causing boils after use. I found these several years ago, and I only use them now. They clean beautifully, and are wonderful for body cleanse (I use two with each shower) as well as facial cloths. Just a caution... they make another facial cleansing cloth that does not have the woven surface, and they do not clean as well for anything but are good as makeup removers. Olay 4-in1 are the very first facial cloths that I've tried. They work very well (I continued to try other brands and find that they do not remove makeup as well as these). Besides being able to remove makeup, including eyeliner and mascara, the cloths lather up great. I can cut one cloth into 4 squares and it still proves sufficient enough to clean my whole face! If you use heavy makeup, then you may need to use the whole sheet or half the sheet. I just love the fact that I can use this around my eye area and not worry about any stinging. My sensitive skin enjoys these facial cloths and I have yet to break out or have any dry peeling skin. These would not be ideal to use for travel or to throw in your purse if you don't have any access to a bathroom to wash off the lather. It's not like I bought them for travel use so the fact that these come dry doesn't bother me. I find myself reaching for these instead of my liquid eye makeup removers. I never liked the idea of using a washcloth more than once without sanitizing it.  I really like these and they are durable enough that I can use one each day as a new and disposable washcloth.  I use it brand new on my face because the wash is impregnated with soap.  Once the soap in the cloth is used up, I just use more soap or body wash like one would with a regular washcloth. So glad I saw this advertisement when playing free solitaire on my smartphone!LOVE this product...so convenient! Super convenient and easy to use. I love how I can take them on the go. I have used these for years to wash my face. Recommend highly Work great for travel or removing makeup quickly before the gym. I still prefer to use makeup remover and face wash for my daily routine. It’s pretty nice. I use it after a workout and it has enough soap/foam to do a quick body wash and not carry a separate one. Acts as a two in one product. Totally worth the money! Excellent, clean, hygienic and easy to use.  Face clothes are something I use for the rest of my body bath, These little guys defoliate clean and zip, go into the basket. Love these facial cloths. Tried a couple other brands, came back to Olay. Very moiturizing and does see benefits after two weeks. I have been using these Olay daily face cloths for several years, and I love them.  They clean the makeup off my face well, and also exfoliate at the same time.  My skin tends to be a bit sensitive, but these do not irritate it.  Just wet a cloth with warm water, scrunch it around with your hands a bit to lather it up (the cleaning soap is imbedded into the dry cloth and activates when wet), then wash your face with it.  I use mine in the shower, and they work great. Very easy to use and help to keep my face clean. Love the dry cloths. Very sudsy. Sheets are big! Used these cloths for years...and great for travel.. great wipes - good to have when traveling.... I love these. They are big enough that I cut them in half. While I find these cloths a bit expensive for regular use, I love to have them around for travel or a quick face wash. They have gotten a bit smaller over - product shrinkage - as have many items we all buy, but are still large enough to do the job. Pleasant light scent. These are great! I cut the sheets in half because they are so big. The have a light smell and my skin feels great afterwards. I cannot find this in any stores. I like the dry wipes because I can take them on vacation easily. Also, when I wet them to wash my face, I can use warm water instead of using a wet wipe which is cold. Cleans very well with a gentle sudsing. Great deal, exactly as expected Exactly what I was looking for Work great - gentle to skin. Use daily.  Very convenient. These are great quick and easy to wash my face at night.  Also, so much cheaper than buying them in Target (they are $11 there).  I have bad acne problems and use special products in the morning but these work great for evening washes and don't aggrevate my acne. Use them all the time, very handy These are good in every way.  You won't ruin towels with make up that hasn't come off with soap.  They are gentle on your skin, and one wipe will do the job.  Really gratifying to 'see' how much make up you  cleansed.  Just the right amount of texture to do some mild exfoliation without scrubbing harshly.  These are dry ~~ so you add some water.  I also like the variety that are pre-moist, but if you don't close the package those will dry out.  These are easy to take on vacation too, so you don't leave a mess on hotel towels or as a house guest.  I add them to my Amazon orders when I need to bump up to the minimum to qualify for free shipping. I have been using Olay Daily Facial Cloths for a little over a year now and I will never use anything else to wash my face. These cloths are so easy and convenient to use. They are not pre-moistened; they are dry and you wet them to wash your face. I love this because if I'm going somewhere I can just pop a few in my bag and not worry about them drying out or making a mess.They also exfoliate gently. The side with blue dots washes more gently than the side without dots which really exfoliates your skin. They suds up really well, I've never felt like the cloths were going to run out of cleanser so you can scrub for quite a while- great for makeup! Since using these my skin is feeling smooth and clean, never dry or tight. I love these. I have used them for years and nothing is easier nor better I started using these after one of my favorite beauty gurus on youtube said she had been using them for years. I had been using scrubs to slough off dead skin, but it was irritating my skin and making it worse. Dry skin needs to be exfoliated to keep the dead skin from clogging your pores and making your complexion dull. Anyway, these cloth wipes ended up being perfect!! They are totally gentle on your face and I can even get the soap in my eyes and it does not sting. I thought maybe I should use the ones made for sensitive skin, but these were fine. There is soap already on the cloths, so just add water and scrub :) They really made my skin soft and helped calm redness (which I suspect came from the harsh scrubs I had been using). My face didn't feel uncomfortably tight after washing, but I always apply a moisturizer anyway. Buying the 2 pack was cheaper and I run out of these all the time, so it worked out buying them online. Overall, these are great for my dry skin and they are really convenient for when I'm feeling lazy or tired. Definitely give em' a try! these are awesome Absolutely love these!!!!! Will be ordering again Love this product. Really cleans off makeup and leaves skin feeling great. Not drying at all. I have been using these for years. I have very sensitive skin, eczema and all, and they have never irritated my skin. My skin is always soft, I have no issues with acne, and as a bonus, I use my used wipe to clean off the counter top after I am done putting my makeup on. I am almost 50 and I am constantly being told that I look like I am in my 30's or 40's. I got these because a doctor recommended them for mild rosacea.  The clothes are huge (I cut them in half).  Works great for makeup removal as well as regular cleaning.  Easy to use, no skin irritation - and less redness! These are great These are the only washcloths I need to take all my makeup off and leave my face clean! Love these Very good LOVE IT! I love these. Difficult to find in store. Cleanses My Face superbly! They work well. A bit oversized. I cut them in half to get longer use Have used these for a few years and love them!  Not harsh yet doesn't cause breakouts.  Removes makeup well and leaves you face feeling very clean.  I use a toner after and no traces of old makeup on the cotton pad after so I know it's getting really clean.  Amazon.com has a great price and periodically offer a coupon too!  I just feel the premoistened cloths just don't clean as well good product I love these and can't live without them. I've been using them for years. Literally, years... like 12 years or something, probably since they first came on the market. Removes makeup completely, doesn't make my skin overly dry, keeps breakouts to a minimum. It's so important when you exfoliate everyday that it be a gentle, sterile product. I used to use a buff puff and it was too abrasive and would harbor nasty bacteria. Once got a horrible rash that lasted weeks. With these cloths you throw them away after one use so you're always using a clean cloth. It may seem a little waste-producing. I give myself a pass because of the undeniable benefits. I tear each sheet in two and get twice the washes out of the box, and create half the waste. I truly don't know what I would do if these were discontinued. Let's hope they make them for the rest of MY life, at least. Best gentle make-up remover cloths on the market! Love these cloths, I've used these cloths for 10+ yrs. They are a must when I travel. They store for long periods of time and I don't have to worry about them drying out. Cloths are great for removing makeup and the cleanser won't leave your skin feeling dry. wonderful for travel - use at home as well I use these daily. Have for years! They get off all the different types of makeup that I have ever used. Love love love . And so easy to travel with. I actually cut each square in half (I cut on the fold) so one box lasts me 2x as long. A whole cloth seems so large to me. I typically have oily skin, and these leave my face feeing so refreshed and clean before going to bed. Super great for traveling or every day use. Removes ALL make up nicely and gently cleanses your face. These are amazing! They get most of my makeup off in the shower so I don't have to use nearly as much remover after, if at all (depends on the mascara). I just read about someone cutting theirs in half which I'm going to try because they're pretty big and give a good amount of suds. Super happy with this purchase! These are the only facial cleansing cloths I have found that truly get your make-up off without causing your eyes to burn in the process.  I love that they have a smooth side which I use for my eyes and then a more textured side that I use on the rest of my face where I scrub a little harder.  There is no scent to these cloths either which is important to me and there is nothing in them that irritates my skin.  My skin is not really combination, it's dry but these work best for me because they have the double sided fabric to work with.  My skin doesn't feel tight or dry after using them either so I think they work well even for dry skin. Very good for removing makeup love olay I wanted to hate these because they DID change the cloth to a more ""paper"" like product.  But I find that for me, these scrub wonderfully and give my face a nice, clean and SOFT result.  I've bought another 60-day supply of them because they work nicely.  They don't FEEL as good when scrubbing but they do a better job in my opinion than the softer, cloth-like cloths. Love these. Perfect and easy to use. Just wet the wipe and scrub your face then rinse. I cut mine in half to get twice the amount for the money. I really like these Olay facial cloths.  They're soft on one side and a little rougher on the other.  Great for exfoliating and clean my face so well. If I'm wearing a heavier foundation (rarely), I also use a makeup removing cloth prior to washing with this.These cloths are so handy for taking on trips, just pack what you need in a sandwich baggie and you're good to go.  Prefer these much more over the pre-moistened cloths.  Price is great for these and they'll last me forever. Does great job getting makeup off I travel a lot and used these cloths when travelling as it saves on taking bottles and keeping within the 100ml limit when taking hand baggage only on flights. After recently moving to Australia I discovered that they are not a common product here and they only have the moist cloths which dry out quickly. Finally I found these on Amazon, great price for the product and delivery to Australia, very quick service and the product arrived in a week. They are the same cloths i use to use and am happy that I have them for my travels again. I do not use them on a daily basis as I like the cleanse tone and moisturise routine but for travels up to a couple of weeks and over night stops these are perfect leaving you with a fully clean fresh face which some wet cloths do not provide..... Very happy indeed! I've used Olay 4-in-1 Daily Facial Cloths since their debut many years ago. Not only are they easily packable for traveling, but they're more sanitary (wet, wash, toss)  – and don't leave make-up stains on cloth washcloths. They're non-irritating to any type of skin and easily (& tearlessly) remove washable mascara. These are my absolute favorite face wash cloths. I have been using these for over a decade now, and have yet to find anything else that works quite like these. I hope they never discontinue them.I have clear combination skin with dry patches on my nose and these work very well. I also love how well they remove eye makeup and DONT STING! Leave the makeup on these little towelettes instead of your linens. Love these! I've been buying these facial cloths for years. They make my skin feel so smooth and clean! Since they're a little expensive, I like to cut each cloth in half. I love the convenience of these cloths.  I use one every night to remove my makeup & clean my skin.  They are dry cloths (which I MUCH prefer to the wet ones), & they have little ""bumps"" on them for exfoliating purposes.  Some of the other Olay daily facials have small holes throughout, but these do not.  The cloth is solid.I do NOT use these to remove my eye makeup.  I have very sensitive eyes, & the only thing I've ever found to remove my eye makeup that doesn't irritate is Clinique Take Off the Day Makeup Remover.  It's made for lips & eyes only.These cloths are absolutely wonderful for travel.  Pack a few in a plastic baggie, & you're set!They recently changed the packaging look & name of these cloths slightly, & at first I thought Olay quit making the cloths I love & have used for years.  I was thrilled to find them here on Amazon! Love these cloths! As we thought...nice I absolutely love these.  I keep them in my gym bag which makes washing my face after workouts super easy and fast.  Plus I don't have to worry about a liquid cleanser leaking in my gym bag.  If you use them in the shower they are also handy for doing a quick foot exfoliation after you are finished using them on your face. My two teenage daughters use these daily.  Both are very active with sports and struggle with some ""teen acne"" issues.  These are so convenient to carry a few in their gym bags.  Run them under water and wipe all that sweaty nastyness right off their face.  I would not say that these alone have completely cleared their skin, but they definitely make a huge improvement!  Because they are so convenient, my girls actually use them.....that is a plus! I’ve been using these for years and love them.  Cleans my skin gently and exfoliates at the same time. This product works wonders. Stated using it last month and immediately noticed a difference in my face after the first week. It doesn't dry out my face, it's easy to use and it helps with my breakouts. I will definitely be purchasing this product again. Same great product. I'm having using this since I was in high school, which has been off and on for the past 15 years. I like trying new things, but now I'm in my late 20's I really enjoying repurchasing my go to products... and my boyfriend appreciates it too since these are cheap ;) Negative reviews do not make sense.Negative reviews include guys who were trying to clean their beard with this.Negative reviews includes someone who says that it makes their skin dry after previously using alcohol wipes and acne medicine.Its a great product to clean your face.  it does not irritate eyes when cleaning the eyelids.  I like that I bought these.  I use them for a good face wash combined with foaming eyelid wash while in the shower. I love these for makeup removal. Love these cloths.They don't  dry your skin. They smell great.They don't cause irritation.Suds up nice. Removes makeup without stinging eyes.When traveling I use them to freshen up and it feels great. I love these for my camping trips each month. Dont have to worry about them drying out. Just add warm water! Suds up and cleans very well. Use these on a daily basis.  Works well and very convenient. Love these, and love that they are so soft! I have sensitive skin, and these do not bother my skin. I couldn't find this ""normal"" version once and tried the ""sensitive skin"" version, which actually caused redness and a rash! These do a great job of removing make-up ,including eye make-up, without a lot of rubbing. I have been using Oil of Olay facial cleaners, moisturizers, and body wash for years and this is my favorite facial cleaner.  I got hooked young when my mother, who is a nurse at a dermatology clinic, would bring home free samples all the time.  This product seems to do a more thorough job of cleaning your pores than the liquid or cream cleaners.  I also found them to be great while traveling since they are light to carry and can double as a descent washcloth for my body wash.  The price is also great! I just saw these at Target for $15 or $7.50 for the 30 pack.  They can be over $8 at the pharmacies for the 30 pack as well. After use my face feels so clean and it's not dried out. Work great!!  Love them... Love these they never dry out, or are not moist enough like other brands, these are dry with the cleanser built in, so you wet them and use them when you are ready, I cut a few in half to use on my eyes for makeup removal they work great, be careful with the suds. Then I use the other half on my face, so it's like I get 60 cloths for the price of thirty and don't need an extra eye make-up remover. Highly recommend. I've been using these for several years.  They remove makeup, eyeliner, mascara & foundation, while cleaning my skin.  I used to use those wet makeup removers & then cleanser but with this product, it's one step and you get the added benefit of exfoliation.I lightly dampen the ""cloth"" to get it sudsy & remove my eye makeup first with the gentle side.  Then I flip it over to the exfoliation side to wash my face & remove foundation.  Rinse & you're good to go.I have combination skin & find this to be the right strength of cleanser; not drying but gets rid of the oil & gunk from the day.  Also perfect for travel since they are dry, disposable & compact. I was hooked after I've use! My face always felt like there was dead skin and I hated it. Haven't had that feeling since using these. My wife uses these and we were unable to find them locally for this price. She has been using them for years and is very happy with them. My face was bumpy and oily. After ONE use, my skin feels brand new, and the microabrasion on the blue bead side definitely gave you the exfoliating you need. No scent. Cut in half. Excellent product by Oil of Olay! This is so much easier to use and take on trips than tubes or bottles of cleanser. I do not like pre-moistened cloths as much as I like these.  These are easy to use, wet/wash/rinse, have some exfoliation benefits because of the textured cloth, and can be used besides just on your face or to remove makeup.  They are not ""baby-wipes""; and I take them when I travel because they easily remove mascara, etc. so that I don't leave dark smudges on washcloths.  Another thing I like is that they don't burn your eyes like some of the pre-moistened ones do. very soapy. I use these every day and they are handy for traveling. I don't like using wash clothes from places I don't know so I take these with me. Olay is a great brand. Great deal. Fast shipping. Highly recommend. As expected These are the original Oil of Olay facial wipes, with the slightly rough side that is good for exfoliating. I just hope I can keep finding them! I have been using these for many years and always cut them in half because of the large size. Half of one will still make lots of great Olay lather! These are so nice because I do not have to use a make-up remover. I just wash with these and use a good daily facial cream. My skin looks great! Amazon has the BEST price on these- great buy! I've been using these for several years. First, I used them just for travel, because they are so very convenient & easy to use.  But now I use them every day!! Not only do they remove dirt, etc. from my face, they are great for makeup removal as well. I wouldn't use anything else! Please, Olay, never discontinue this product! A few years ago my face began to become oilier - very ironic since I had perfect skin throughout my teen years and my twenties. :-) Regardless, along with the oil came mild but persistent acne. I began using these cloths every day: twice a day at first and then just once a day as my skin began to improve. I incorporated a daily Olay moisturizer and voila!! - My skin looks and feels great! Whenever I see some oil starting to build up again, I resume the twice-daily usage until I see improvements. For the most part - using these cloths daily has helped my skin tremendously - much better than all the face washes I tried. And believe me I tried them ALL before I resorted to the cloths. :-) The cloths really seem to exfoliate and deep cleanse, which apparently is what I needed. I recommend these cloths to anyone who may find him or herself in the same situation as me – needing a new skin care regiment. I have sensitive skin, but have never had problems with these Olay cloths. I use them daily. I especially like them when traveling - no liquid to count towards my carry-on allowance. They also come in handy when traveling abroad and you find there are no washcloths at the hotel. I love these, especially for travel. One less liquid item to fit in carry on and they do the job well. Its face wipes, my Wife loves them and wants me to order her more. Happy Wife, happy Life, the end! I used to have really bad acne and scarring. Among other factors, this really helped to clear my face up. My face always feels fresh and clean afterwards. a Love these! Use daily! Can't go wrong with Olay products. After trying maybe dozens of different facial products, these Facial Cloths have worked best for my acne prone skin. I tear each Cloth in two and leave that 2nd half for the next use. I've been doing that for several years now and have found that to be both sufficient and efficient. Wonderful product. Great feeling on your face leaves skin clean Really like the way this makes my face feel.....clean and ready for moisturizer. I can't find these in the stores any more. I cut them in half to make them last longer. Great. These cloths are a great way to exfoliate daily. I am very pleased with how smooth my face feels after washing with these cloths. They are great for travel also. I use these at night to take off my makeup and even eye makeup! {I do not use waterproof mascara}.  It could be my imagination, but I think one side is for ""exfoliating"" and the other side is what I use to remove my eye makeup.  It seems to be more gentle.  I've used them for years now and am very pleased with them.  This is a great price on Amazon.  I get them on a subscription basis so that I never run out. Love these they don't break me out or make my excema worse, they are kind of drying but one takes off all my makeup so good and helpin my skin a lot! Olay is one of the only brands that's doesn't irritate me excema I have used this product for years. They are getting harder to find in stores. They are generally cheaper on Amazon. Not a fan of using soap on my face.  They ate great at removing the most stubborn makeup. I'm a huge fan of Olay products and as usual this one did not disappoint. They clean quite well and leave my face feeling very smooth. Olay is one of the very few products that no matter what I try from their line thus far does not react badly with my extremely over sensitive skin. Love it. Love these! These are so easy to use - just wet one with warm water and begin cleansing my face.  It doesn't irritate my eyes which I appreciate very much.  I don't like to be without these. My skin is very sensitive.  I have not used wash clothes in years because after one use they tend to irritate my skin.  I cannot use the pre-moistened ones because they just push the dirt into my skin and grind the makeup into my pores.  These are the best ones that foam up with warm water and help keep my skin clean and clear.  These are the only ones that I have used for year, so glad they come in bulk online. I love this product. Doesn't dry out my skin and lathers nicely when water is added to it. I like that it has two different textures. One side is a little more quilted from exfoliation while the other is smoother. I definitely would purchase this again. My go to cleanser. I love these cloths and with the $2.00 coupon, they're a steal. I use them twice a day. I cut them in half and only use 1 cloth a day this way, so they last 66 days. I also use the cloth to rinse the soap off my face. I just rinse the cloth and squeeze out the water a couple of times until the soap is out and then use it to rinse my face. The fragrance is mild and quite nice. They haven't caused me any skin breakouts or other problems.I buy these regularly and highly recommend to others. I have been using these facial cloths for years and paying the high price in the but now I found a much better deal on Amazon, I tell you I LOVE Amazon!  This product is great for removing makeup at the end of the day and did I mention even the mascara, we all know that one is hard to remove at night, but these little babies do the trick every time.  Fast shipping and GREAT price!  Thank you! I normally don't write reviews for stuff but I am guilty of buying stuff based on other people's reviews.  So am hoping my review can help someone.  I absolutely love this facial cloths.  I tried them because Ulta sent me a trial offer and I just couldn't understand how a dry cloth, gets so much lather when you dip it in little water, and then cleans off all my make-up - including eye make-up. Very nice product. I'm on the second box and I am sold for life! I love these!! I think these have improved since my last purchase! How often do we find that to be true?  Great for travel, as another reviewer noted, since they do not contain moisture. Crazy about these for camping trips.  I always take them to Africa where showers are delivered to your tent and you have limited water.  They are quick to use and have plenty of soap for a thorough wash. love this cleanser!! Great face cloths to use for travel because they don't have to be put in a ""liquid bag"" like normal face soap. Just shove some in your bag! They smell great, take off all of your makeup/sweat, and leave you feeling fresh and clean. I have trouble finding these in stores and love them so much. Great for sensitive skin- just don't rub too hard. :) Just like what I purchase in the drugstore but don’t have to drive there. Great product! My face is very sensative, so when it comes to washing off my makeup I use these to do the job. I have purchased these twice now, because they are so great. I love using the Olay Daily 4-in-1 cloths! They clean the skin, get rid of makeup without leaving any type of residue on your face or on your towel, and they are great for travel. Ive used this product for over 2 years and can only say good things about it. Im a guy, but I use this because its way more convenient than having a tube full of something. I just pull one cloth out everyday. I used it everyday to clean my face of all that acne causing stuff. It leaves my face feeling refreshed and very clear. Remember to moisturize after using this. Ive also used the ""Normal"" skin version and it works very well as well. This one in comparison has more of an exfoliating texture to it. I had previously purchased a 33-wipe pack from Amazon.  My wife is very pleased as she showed me how much make-up the wipes takes off even AFTER she cleans her face.  The wipes comes with its own moisturizers and it is the last thing she does before she retires for the night.  This 66-count should last for a while and I might do the Amazon Subscribe and Save program to keep these delivered periodically. Love these cloths.  They suds up fast and remove all traces of makeup.  They have a nice smell.  I will continue to purchase. There are like small soft make up removers. It's different but I like them. These are the best Daily Facials wipes that I have ever had! I always hated the pop up ones that seemed dried out by the time you got to the bottom or the last one was dripping with solution. I also had to use more that one to get off all of my makeup. This works great for taking off ALL makeup and even my mascara, with just one cloth.  I used to have to use a separate cleanser to remove my waterproof mascara. This left my skin feeling so soft and clean without feeling like it left a residue.  I will never buy any other kind.  This is the best! Rougher texture on one side - smoother on the other.  Provides deep cleansing using the rougher texture, and gentle cleaning around the eyes with the smoother texture.  Foams up well.  These are dry cloths which lather well when water is applied.  My skin feels so smooth after use.  Removes make up fast and efficiently.  Highly recommend these and will continue to purchase them. Great product These cloths are amazing! They keep your skin silky , smooth, and glowing. All beauties need to have these in their vanity!!!xoxoxox I have used these for many years. These are a must have for removing make up and deep cleansing. I can't imagine life without them. ive been using this product for about a year now. theyre super easy to use, especially for travel. i just pack a couple cloths with my other toiletries and am good to go for a few days. ive tried the normal skin version of this, but like this one better because:a) my skin is more combination/oily than normalb) the exfoliating surface is more robust and you feel cleaner after youre doneoverall, recommend a hundred times over! These are great for every day, and especially for travel.  No worries about boarding with liquids.  The clean well and leave my face and ears feeling moisturized. I love these facial wipes. They make my face feel clean every time I use one every morning and the price is right. I've been using these for years, and I was very happy to see them on subscribe and save. To me, these do a much better job of completely cleaning my face than any other product I've tried. They even take off eye make up. I use an additional make-up remover to get the last bit of mascara, but that's mainly because of the type of mascara I use. I know some people prefer wet wipes (these are dry) but I find these work much better. I have used this product off and on over the years.  I have dry sensitive skin, and find many products are just too harsh.  These cloths have a softer side and a rougher side for better exfoliating.  I love that Amazon has this product on Subscribe and Save for a great price and it is delivered to my home on a schedule.  Thanks. OLAY!! I've been using this for years.  I used to buy it at Target and Walmart but it's cheaper if you subscribe and save with Amazon.  Plus it's delivered to you for free so you save on gas and time as well.  It works great as a mild face exfoliator.  Because it's a cloth, my face feels extra clean after using it.  It does a great job with removing makeup as well. Pretty good I must say! They do not come wet which I like since they won't dry out. All you need to do it wet it with water. It does a great job at getting make-up off! Love these cleansing cloths!  They used to carry them at a local warehouse club but stopped.  Thanks Amazon for carrying them at a good price! I love using the 4-in-1 Daily Facial Cloths, It leaves my skin feeling clean, fresh and soft. And I only have to use 1-cloth at a time, it's very rich in lather and gets my face clean in no time. Thank you Amazon!!! I love these. Use em every morning and night. I'm lazy and always in a rush in the morning so I like that I can just wet these, scrub, and toss and that's it. These cleansing clothes are a great ""Plan B"" for when I don't have the time, or the inclination, to go through my entire beauty regime.  A cost-saving hint: When I first open the package, I cut all the cloths in half.  Those half cloths still suds up nicely and get the job done. These are amazing! They are light, easy to wet, don't dry out the face, but get off all the grime and sweat at the end of a travel day. Love these cloths-- they're really large, so I cut them into quarters which are more than sufficient to clean makeup off of my oily face!Great price too for the amount of use you get out of them, and the scent is pleasant and mild. I travel a great deal and have found that this is the easiest way to carry cleansing clothes. Most others are already wet but these are dry and only take water to activate. I love these towelettes!  I have used them for years and I love that I can order them here in a three pack! I always use this product and have for a long time.  The only good way to promote good skin care. Wouldn't use anything else to remove makeup. excellent product These are my moms absolute favorite thing to wash her face with. I have used them a few times and I really like them when traveling. My mom cannot live without them though. THESE WORK GREAT I sometimes will add an astringent or cleaner in addition to the cloth, and watch as the makeup thoroughly disappears into the cloth.  It is a quick efficient way to clean up makeup, much gentler than using good old soap and water.  Finish up with a nice moisturizer, and the job is done.  Your face will thank you!* I order this often and have never had a problem with the shipment & I love this product. Better than most cleansing cloths, because it works for eye makeup removal (even for very sensitive eyes), and it doesn't dry out your skin. I've been using these for years. No need to spend a fortune on facial cleansers...even removes waterproof mascara, just need to rub the soapy bubbles gently on eyes for a minute or so.  Smells wonderful, lots of lather. These cloths are terrific - removes makeup, cleanses & leaves your skin soft. Highly recommended Love these wipes, I like that I can wet them and wash my face and then rinse out the soap to rinse my face. I like these cloths a lot better than the pre-moistened ones. Love how they clean off makeup.  The textured cloths provide some gentle exfoliation as well. These facial cloths are great. Each cloth can be used twice, just reactivate it with warm water. It leaves your face feeling soft and clean. I've been using these for about 8 years now. Like everyone else I love this. It takes off makeup even on the waterline with no tears. Ok I will admit it might take a while to get use to the texture, it's like a thick gauze, but if it works. I usually buy these at the grocery store or Target, but I ordered them on Amazon since I was already placing an Amazon order for another product.  The price was comparable to what i pay in the store.In my experience, these are the only cloths that remove all my makeup.  I don't even use a full cloth per use--I rip them in half--and they still get the job done. I have been getting these facial cloths for quite a while now.  I use one every night before I go to bed to wash my makeup off.  They leave my face feeling clean and refreshed.  They do not irritate my eyes at all.  I get them every two months on subscribe and save to make sure I don't run out.  Love them! The absolute best facial cloths!! These are my go to daily. Perfect for travel too since they are dry and activated by water... Use them all of the time. Finding them at a good price on Amazon is great! I love Olay facial cloths. These have a soft side and a little more of a rougher side to scrub your face. The cloth smells good and it thoroughly cleans my face without leaving it tight. I pack these when I go on trips so I don't have to take liquid bottles with me. Also, these are great for removing mascara and eyeliner that always smears under my eyes when I wash up. Great product - have used for years.  Better deal here than my local grocery store, unless they are running a sale. I have been using these for 13 years and I absolute love them. They do a great job of removing makeup and make my face feel so clean! I have tried the ones that do not require water and I just don't get the same clean feeling. I hope these are still around for years to come. These works very well for removing makeup.  I like that they are dry cloths and I make them as warm or hot as I want.  I like them way more than the type of makeup remover cloths that are pre-moistened.  I get these at a great deal with my subscribe and save subscription.  I have a very hard time finding these in stores, so I love that they are available on Amazon! I've been using these for years.  They take the makeup off easily.  I thought I had ordered the ones for normal skin as my skin is not oily.  So be careful when placing your order. the BEST facial cleansing cloths EVER! I have sensitive skin and this caused NO irritation! My 10-year old and I use these religiously. They do a great job removing make-up (for me) and keeping our face clean. Naturally, Amazon's pricing is better than anywhere else, and I save even more money by having this automatically delivered through Subscribe & Save. My husband and I both enjoy the daily cloths that easy to pack and go. These are great for daily use or travel. All you do is wet them & they lather like crazy. Good for sensitive skin like mineNo need for a face cloth - great value great for travel - exfoliating cleansing clothes complete with a mild cleanser. Perfect!!! My face feels so amazing after washing with these. Instantly part of my nightly routine now. Take a off makeup really well too! I love these Olay face cloths. I've been using them for at least 10 years. I have sensitive skin, and these do not make me break out. They leave my skin feeling soft and smooth. I've loved these facial wipes ever since I was a young teenager. My mom bought them for me on a whim one day and I've been hooked ever since. They're so easy and convenient to use after a long day and you just want to get the makeup and dirt off your face before you crash into bed. Most cleansers tend to dry out my skin, so I just keep a jar of coconut oil in my bathroom cabinet and slather a bit on my face after washing before I head to bed. Works like a charm. These wipes get off everything from eyeshadow, eyeliner, mascara, lipstick, foundation, dirt, oil, etc. I use once a day before bed -- any more than that I think would be a little harsh with all the scrubbing from the cloth. These have been in my bathroom cabinet for the past 15+ years and they will be there for the foreseeable future! My mother asked me to buy her some dry facial wipes because the wet ones were way too impractical and she didn't like them. Of course, I took to Amazon first and came across these. Wasn't quite sure from the product description if these were, in fact, dry or not. I saw a review that said they were so I went with it and bought 4 of them.Arrived quickly with Amazon Prime and my mother could not be happier. Thank you Amazon! Love love this product and very satisfied with how well it works!!! A great investment for your whole family. Oil of Olay products never let me down!!! I have been using these towelettes for years and believe they do a great job cleaning without stripping.  I prefer ""dry"" towelettes to those that are pre-moisten by far so I can't ask for anything else and highly recommend. I really like these because they are not moist. I just run them under the water a second, wash with rougher side and then rinse and use softer side to remove soap. They make my face feel so clean and soft and they couldn't be more convenient! I love that they lather so nicely...way better than wipes that come pre-wet. These are the best freaking things for my face since... my face!  I never really washed my face with face washing stuff because face washing stuff sucks but these make it so easy!  I actually wash my face twice a day now. :D Such an easy way to take off your makeup.  They travel well and are great for freshening up.  I am horrible at taking off my makeup and washing my face at night, I'm normally too exhausted.  This makes it easier for me to be more disciplined to do it! love them These are fantastic for travel because all you have to do is add water.  Easy to transport. I have been using these for years.  They come dry and you add water, which also makes them lightweight and perfect for travel.  Because they come dry, you don't have to worry about storing them in a closed container, and they are very hygienic.  I ordered them on the automatic order and just received my second shipment--I'll never run out again! Works very well. Makes face washing very easy. These are nice! I usually bring them with me when I travel. These are a little bit more involved then makeup remover wipes- but also feel better than using them, too! I love the smell and the way they clean your face. Lifetime customer, right here! Removing your make up at the end of the day these Olay 2-in 1 Facial Cloths are wonderful. Just apply a little bit of water and the cloths make a nice lather and wash away all your makeup. You can even store a few in your makeup bag when you are travelling and wash the grime away once you arrive at your destination. The best part about these cloths after you wash your face it feels nice and smooth. I started out using the face clothes just for travel but found them so convenient that I use them daily now.  I feel good about using a fresh cloth on my face everyday...no chance for bacteria to grow as there would be in a washcloth.  Also prevents make-up stains on wash cloths. Can't live without this item.  Love it! Love these things.  I have been without them for awhile until I found them on Amazon.  They take off the make up but leaves your skin soft.  Give them a try. Keeps my skin clean and soft... never dry. Have been using this product for years. These are the best cloths I have ever used. I love that they are dry because they are easy to store. Only my most waterproof makeup won't come off with these cloths Love to take these when I travel - especially to Europe and other countries that are skimpy on wash cloths. Saves taking a lot of products, plus you have extra room as you use them, giving inches to more souvenirs. Great cleanserEasy for traveling These are fantastic for someone like me who doesn't use soap everyday. You can hydrate them as your convenience. They seem to do a great job at not only cleaning away oil, dirt and make-up but they are gentle. They won't sting your eyes allowing you clean even your eyelids. Made my morning routine faster. Love these Olay face cloths. I've used them for years. I used to be able to find them in a three pack. Price a little cheaper on Amazon. Started using these last fall.  They work very well for my combination complexion.  Easy to use when traveling. These are great at getting make-up off while providing a little soft scrub. I've been using them for years and love them. So easy to travel with too -- you just need a little water. I found these at Sam's club at a great deal. I was hooked by the time they stopped selling them.These are normally pretty pricey. I was really happy to find this as an add-on item at a great price. My face loves these.  It like a mini spa trip every time I use one.  They leave my face nice and clean, takes away dry spots, but still leaves my face feeling fresh.  These take off make up like a charm, and they aren't per-moistened so they won't dry out. I love the Oil of Olay daily facial cloths.  I have used them for several years, and like the gentle cleanser. This is great for traveling when you can't put a lot of liquid in your carry-on.  This does an excellent job of cleaning the makeup and debris off my face, and it's compact enough to fit into any ole space in my carry-on. Great product and very fast shipping. great product! quick service! These combination/oily daily facials leave my skin feeling clean when nothing else does. I've used them for years and have tried other products when I've run out of Olay. It always takes weeks for my skin to recover! I'm 39 and still waiting for that post-adolescent skin to kick in! But until then I'll keep using these religiously. :-) Love this so much!!!!!! Just one and it cleans even the waterproof makeup right off. I have normal to dry skin and have used these cloths for years.  They are great!  The get the makeup and oil off well without over drying and exfoliate just enough at the same time.  I have tried other cloth types and brands and always broke out or my face felt tight and I returned back to these. I was using apricot scrub that doesn't work for oily skin. It took some time to get my face back to where it should be but am pleased it is getting rid of the oil and dirtGreat buy :) Instant clarity! love it These are a wonderful device for washing your face or removing your makeup prior to caring for your face. These are the only facial cloths I have found that are dry, and are stored dry. When you want to use them, add a little warm water, scrunch them around a little to make them soapy, and you are all ready to go! Price is fair market excellent transaction - highly recommend this product I have used these for years!! I LOVE them! Love these cloths; I get them all the time but they are great for traveling as they're lightweight! They suds up pretty easily with water and take off my water-proof mascara pretty easily.  And they're not overly-drying towards my skin! Very satisfied. These are wonderful for traveling and work very well. They are well saturated with soap, and are very gentle to the skin. I've been using these for years and my kids' friends say they're lying when they tell them how old I am.  My doctor also said they are good for rosacea. been using these for years and years… great for make-up removal and eliminates need for a separate toner. I love these facial cloths.  They do the job of removing all of my makeup and leave my skin super clean and they are light weight and wonderful for traveling.  I don't have to worry about them opening and getting everything in my makeup bag wet. These really work nice and makes my skin feel soft and smooth.  One od my favorite  products. I love these so much that I recently ordered for a second time. These are my new go to cleanser. They make my skin feel amazing and clean while gently removing my makeup. Using a dry towelette like this makes washing your face much easier and quicker which means I do it much more often! The wet wipe ones from other brands dry out too quickly and do not lather like these do. I like the texture because I'm exfoliating without irritating my skin. I also like the fact it comes in two packs so I can have some them in multiple places (like bathroom and gym bag). I really like the idea of cutting them in half so I will try that!If you found this review helpful please click ""yes."" I was not paid or discounted for this review. I love these.  I alternate using my Clarisonic and these.  They are so handy to take along on vacation too.  Will buy again. Love these cloths. Great for getting off make up and feeling clean. Love them!! Good Item My room mate tolf me i was wasting my money, well the package came quickly she used one came out said to me this face cloths are the best. Case Closed. 5 Stars Love it totally! I usually don't write reviews but this product is totally worth a review! Have used them for years. Gentle as it contains no alcohol but cleans very well."
B01N230BY3," The scrub has a creamy texture and smell strongly of honey.  It applies easily to the skin, and rinses off without effort.  My skin feels soft after use, and it has helped with my break-outs Hippie Honey is delicious.  I love how it gently exfoliates and leaves my skin really soft. And it smells so good. This is my very favorite Hippie Skin product!  I swear this stuff is magic!  After battling acne for TWENTY years, I finally found something that works for my face - Hippie Skin!  I use Hippie Honey morning and night and my face is the smoothest it has ever been!  Hippie Honey goes on smooth and leaves my face feeling fresh and clean... it smells amazing too! This is my daughter's favorite product. She has tried many products in the past to help her face stay clean and this is the only one that works. I'm glad that it is all natural and it helps keep her face clean and healthy feeling. Love this. I chatted with the creator of Hippie Skin and told her since I turned 30 the texture of my skin has changed. I still have acne but I feel it's also thinner and more prone to damage. It's unfair to deal with acne and have to worry about crows feet.She said she had just the thing and it's honey based, I've used honey serums before so knew they can be great. You just need a little bit of this mix it with some water to soften up. It goes on very smooth. Once I was done my skin felt great. It's exfoliating but not so much that it irritates my sensitive skin. I absolutely love The Hippie Skin System. I have spent hundreds if not thousands of dollars on very expensive  face cleansers and moisturizers and nothing would get rid of my breakouts. Using The Hippie Skin System I have not only rid my face of acne, but it has also evened out my skin tone and erased the ugly brown spots and scaring caused by Acne. Thanks to Hippie Skin not only do I have a clear complexion, but it also has given me my confidence back. I will not use anything else!! This product is AMAZING!! The whole Hippie Skin care line has transformed my skin. I actually look forward to washing my face day and night with these products. It leaves your skin feeling so fresh, hydrated, and clean. My husband tells me all the time how great my skin is looking. It's a MUST try, you'll be hooked!! I LOVE these amazing products- Amanda Turner I use Hippie Honey religiously; it is invigorating and rejuvenating. I'll always follow a face wash with Hippie Mist to ensure my pores stay protected. Even if my face is covered in pimples I  feel beautiful after every use! I struggle with skin care regimens. Hippie Honey is the best it is so gentle on my skin while also shrinking and cleaning out my blackheads! I can't get enough of this skin care line, my face literally glows when I use it! Love!  Amazing!  What a great product and I love supporting a small business that is great to their customers. I just love hippie skin! The whole line is absolutely amazing. Hippie honey is an everyday face scrub that works miracles on evening out my dry/oily face! used with Hippie Mist and Hippie Luxe you have a new face regime that makes your face happy. This stuff is amazing. I have super sensitive skin and I love how wonderfully soft it makes my face feel and never caused a break out yet. It is my favorite!!! I love this stuff. My skin always feels soft for an extended period of time after using this scrub. I've recommended it to friends and family. Absolutely  love love love this stuff!  It cleans well and tastes great:) no i dont eat it but once in awhile i get some on my lips so i just lick it off.  I use this with the toner and hippie lux.  I even got my grandmother using these products. I absolutely LOVE Hippie Skin and I LOVE the Hippie Honey. I use it on my face every single morning and have been for years. My face has never been more clear from acne and as radiant. You won't regret trying it! I love the honey scrub! I often combine it with one of the natural scrubs but I also use it on its own. It's a clean, refreshing face wash. Hippie Honey is my go to cleanser! The first time I ever used it my pores were noticeable cleaner. No product has ever done that for me. Hippie Honey is my number one favorite Hippie Skin product. I love the smell and feel of the honey and little sugar crystals on my face!"
B01J3727RY," good! Best facial cleanser ever! Like ! I love this stuff! I have very sensitive skin and never have a problem with the Simple line of products. So glad to have something I can use everyday. I love this face wash. It always leaves my face feeling clean and fresh. Love this simple face cleanser. Very light and airy, but still leaves skin feeling clean. I love this cleansing foam. it has a fresh smell. one pump is more than enough to wash thoroughly the whole face and the result is a very clean non grease feeling. Does not dry my skin after using it. This face wash foams up to a really soft lather, it rinses clean and does not leave any oil or residue behind. Love this product, great price, will be getting again. I have been using this brand for years....thats how long it took me to finish my last bottle of it. Just one pump, and some warm water, and it will clean up well, and last forever if you use it casually. Product foam is more delicate, cleanliness is more moderate Great product. Will order again."
B0182Y1IUG," Love this clay mask. It makes my skin feel soft and moist. Every time I start breaking out I use this mask and it helps heal the new acne and prevent future breakouts. It's definitely with the money This is an excellent mask for daily use for those suffering from acne or other skin problems. The mask is effective for drying up lesions, but at the same time is gentle and nourishes the skin. I have really noticed a difference after using the mask continually for 3 days straight. Highly recommend. This is a very good mask. I use it after I shower,and it has helped my pores visibly tighten. My face felt a little dry after using the mask, and even after I applied moisturizer. I have mildly sensitive skin, and this product did not: make my face break out, completely dry out my skin, or irritate my skin. It does burn a little when you first apply it, but it fades quickly as it dries. I would purchase again. I've been suffering from terrible adult acne for over 3 years now. Nothing has been able to clear my face until I started using this product. Going on two months of perfect skin. I cannot sing enough praise about this mask!! I started using this Mineral clay mask the day it arrived and have been using it twice a week since. I love this product. Its so easy to use and it leaves my skin so soft and less oily since I started using it. Highly recommended! I love this company for their anti aging skin care products.  I now have their full line and love what it is doing for my aging skin from to much sun when I was younger. Healing Clay Mask is another great product, and yes I do rave about them and their products. This mask you can feel working after a few minutes and I love the feel afterwards.  Id recommend to anyone. I just tried this for the first time and I LOVE IT ! ! just after the first use I instantly noticed a difference. it left my skin feeling fresh and clean. when you first apply it there is a tingly feeling but nothing bad and once it dries the tingling is gone. I definitely recommend this 100% Wonderful face mask!  Tingles a bit when first applied which them goes away as it dries.  I love everything about this face mask! This is day 2 since using this product and I can already see the difference! My blackheads seem to be less noticeable and I love how soft my skin feels afterwards. ❤️ This is the best product I have ever used for my face. Definelty purchasing again :) thank you! 💞 I really like this and will buy it again.  I took off one star for the consistency of the clay.  When I go to put it on, it's a little clumpy, so some will drop to the counter or on my shirt.  Its annoying.  Plus directions state to do a thick layer.  Due to the consistency, you cant really do a THICK layer.  It does burn a little at first, but for me, it was just a little and no big deal.  I started out with 15 minutes.  After that, I went to 30 minutes and my face was fine.  Face looks and feels super clean after using it.  My face was bright and very clean looking after.  I love how tight it gets when it's dry.  I place a warm, wet washcloth over my face, then rinse and gently rub off my face in a circular motion...then splash warm water on my face, before splashing with cold water and drying my face.  It IS a very small jar, but I like it and will be buying more.*UPDATE ... 01/24/18 - I've been using pretty regularly and I added the star I'd initially taken off, cuz I love this stuff!  lol A really nice mask.  Doesn't feel as strong (pulling on the sin) as other masks, but it definitely does the trick...leaving skin smooth with diminished pores.  The really nice surprise is that it rinses off so easily!  I like this product so much that I am getting these to share as presents!! This mask works great. Works great and non-irritating. I'm pregnant so needed a mask that was going to be very gentle on my skin. This fits the bill, while still working as any other mask you might use. Skin feels very soft afterwards. This product works great. Can definitely see a difference before and after use. Would highly recommend! Very impressed, I could see results the next day!  this is an amazing product! I am really impressed with this mask.  It feels great using it and it doesn't cause breakouts afterwards.  It is a great product. I like using this product. I use it everyday in other to prevent new breakouts from coming. Stings a little but goes away after a minute or so. Love it love it just love it,its my second time order and this clay mask is one of my favorite now. Since the first time I used it, I could feel how this mask works on my face :3 My skin is oily but not anymore. Great mask, a little goes a long way. Help skin look great...costumer service.is wonderful with there follow ups would purchase again This works very well on my face, I'll definitely order one more soon. Thanks. Very soothing and gentle mask, left my skin looking and feeling great. I use this every other day and have had absolutely no reactions, other than positive.  My nose has an attitude, and is very vindictive.  That skin likes to wait until I'm overseas on a training trip to decide to act like a teenager.  This trip I put those actions to a halt.  My skin is so soft after using this, as well as my pores are smaller and so clean.  I love how easily it breaks down with water added, after I have let it dry and want it removed.  Thank Derma-nu for such a great product.  I am a customer for life. Good mask! I bought this for my daughter since she loves to pretend play. This is exactly what she wanted. Thank you Easy application and so refreshing after the treatment. Received at a great discount and quick shipment. I absolutely love this! I use it every two days and it feels like it is sucking all the impurities out! Derma-nu Healing Clay Mud mask (Skin Nourishing Mineral Clay Mask) is packaged in a 2-ounce whilte plastic tub with a screw on lid. The mask is an off-white in color and a thick clay mask, but it applies and spreads out very nice and even. It has no smell. I have sensitive skin, I left it on the full 20 minutes, (Directions say 15-30). At first it was cool and nice feeling, then it did start to get a bit tingly so I took it off. My skin felt great, soft and smooth, clean and a nice healthy pink glow. The bright pink went away in half hour or so, I think it was just the increased circulation or the slight burning that I started to feel.I have used this several times now 5 or 6 over a couple weeks time and I am now leaving it on the full 30 minutes and it doesn't burn. It does feel cool and get nice and tingly, but I guess I got used to it. Afterwards my face is a nice link. After the link goes away, my face just looks healthy. It does help firm and give you a better skin tone and texture. Cleans the pores out very well. Rinses off very easily just by  getting your face wet and massaging in small little gentle circles and keep rinsing. As you are massaging in the little circles you are removing the old dead skin it is removing and your face feels great afterwards. I love facials and masks, but I just can't justify the cost of them at a spa often enough to make me happy. I think this is just a good as a spa mask, you can do in the comfort of your own home and really get relaxed a couple of times a week and take time for yourself.Disclosure: I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions.

If my review was helpful to you, would you please vote, yes. I try to do my reviews honest with the pros and cons I can see myself in a product, and with facts that a potential customer might find useful.. I have decently normal skin. I get a few acne bumps here and there but nothing major. I wanted to try this because I recently switched to organic bath products (highly recommend) and I needed a good face mask for regular routine maintenance. It stung just a little when I first put it on which is probably just the mask cleaning my pores. After a minute or two that goes away. It hardens pretty fast. I left it on for 30 minutes and washed it off with warm water. I can't say that it gets rid of acne after one use but I don't know of any product that does. It did leave my face feeling refreshed and clean. I also used it on my husband which due to his line of work he has a lot of oil on his face. It did miracles for him. I could tell a bigger difference on him than myself. His face looked rejuvenated, clean and had somewhat of a glow. We used a small bit of moisturizer afterwards which I would definitely recommend due to the mask leaving your face feeling a bit tight. Id have to say this is the best mask I have tried so far for a decent price. I will definitely buy again in the future. Has a good consistency, and a little will go a long way. Non irritating, and it tightens and kinda feels warm as it dries. I will likely continue to use this, and will update my review as needed. Easy to use.*I was compensated to honestly review this item. Let me start off by saying that I have used this mask for 4 consecutive days and I LOVE it. The first day, there was definitely a tingle as it settled into my skin. I personally have a high tolerance to tingles and burns on my face as I can intrepret them as ""working well"". The second day, though? NO tingle whatsoever. I feel as if all the bad stuff had been eliminated the day prior and I was just doing some good old follow up skin detoxing. I have a knack for clay masks and really appreciate the packaging of this clay, in a smaller circular container and easy to finger out clay. It stores nicely under my sink and is easily accessible. It is also very easy to wash off your face, gently with either a cloth or warm water and your fingers. I personally love the way my face feels after the mask, so clean, fresh and rejuvenated! The next day as well! That is why I have performed this mask for 4 consecutive days as I want the full detox and cleansing effect! Highly recommend to all :)Also, it is worth getting through the tingle/burn initally. It definitely goes away and it has never come back! Worth it! As someone with large pores, extremely oily skin, and constant breakouts, I can say that this mask is extremely effective. I have been using it 1-2 times a week for over a month now with great results. My breakouts go away quicker (especially when using this as an overnight spot treatment) and my pores are tighter on my cheeks and around my nose area.This mask is very gentle and doesn't irritate my mildly sensitive skin, which is a relief (so many things irritate my skin or make it worse). I usually leave it on for 45 - 60 minutes, but that's just a personal preference and mostly because I'm too lazy to go upstairs and wash it off before then! It doesn't get all hard, itchy or start to crack either, like some masks (mainly mud masks).I rinse off with lukewarm water and my face looks smoother and feels softer. I sometimes even use this mask instead of washing my face (after getting up - not before bed) because I feel it does an adequate job of cleaning my skin and pores. It's very cooling and a little tingly at first, but that goes away after a few minutes.The jar is a bit small so I use as little as possible (apply a very thin layer). If you've had success with Kaolin clay in the past, then you shouldn't have any issues with it. I also love that it has spirulina and kelp in it - two great ingredients that I rarely see in a mask!A free sample was provided for evaluation and review. If you are looking for a mask to try out before you buy, this is the one! It's affordable and it isn't too much. I tried this out since i have enormous pores and I hate it! I needed something to help me out with my pore holes! I try and use a lot of mask and they've all been working but this is probably one of my favorite masks! It really does help clean out all the gunk in my pores. It does give off a tingly feeling but I LOVE the tingly feeling! Makes it feel like it's working! after I wash off this mask, my face is a little red but not allergic reaction red, just a pale pink because of the blood flow from all that tingling. It makes my face feel so soft afterwards. I really do like this mask.*disclosure - I did receive the item(s) above for either a deeply discounted price or free.

This is a disclosure in accordance to the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255: ""Guides Concerning the Use of  Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising. As a huge Derma-nu fan, I'm not surprised at all that this Mineral Clay Mask calmed my raging skin (what happened to my skin?  Halloween candy?  I don't know, but it was BAD.  All kinds of blemishes all over my chin!)  Anyway, I steamed my face first and then used the clay mask.  I left it on for about 15 minutes, gently washed off with lukewarm water and voila ...the redness had diminished significantly.  The inflammation was gone (from raised to flat) and I was much happier with my skin.Thank you Derma-nu for your awesome products!  I appreciate the thought that goes into your business! A cute little mask for when you're breaking out. I saw a bunch of small pimples on my face and started feeling self conscious. I put on this mask and let it dry. It dried very quickly and it turns very white. You will look a little scary! The instructions are very helpful, telling you to wet your face first before trying to wipe/rinse the mask gently off. My pores were much smaller and the redness of the bumps was drastically diminished. Definitely a mask I would use again. DO moisturized afterwards or your skin will feel very tight.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. These products are incredible. At 62 My skin had become very dry. After using just the moisturizer I was hooked! This mask is light, easy to use and remove. Skin is moist, no visible pores and toned. I really like the derma-nu products.  This mask goes on smoothly and hardens quickly.  It's easy to remove, and my face felt smooth.  I'm a big fan of this product line! I love this mask! It tingles when I apply it. I FEEL it working. It dries quickly and hardens, which I love. I let it sit for about 10 minutes before a toddler is begging for me to get out of the bathroom. But it is really relaxing. I love the natural ingredients, and the clay for healing my skin. I recently had to switch face washes and my face is not happy about it. This is helping me so much. This is one of my all time favorite skin care products! It gives fantastic - immediate results!The product comes in a small container, but don't underestimate it, it is small - but mighty. I tried this product out, all soon as I received it. The clay mask goes on easy and smoothed out over any area you want to use it on. It dries within about 10 minutes, but the instructions say to leave it on longer. I did. By the time the clay mask had been on for 30 min, I couldn't move my mouth. I could feel my skin tightening!After 3O min, I went ahead and washed it off with a towel. My skin was so much softer that it was before I applied the clay mask! I also noticed that my pores appeared smaller. My areas of dry skin Were eliminated in one use. this works very well on my skin whenever i first spot an acne , this clears it upit tingles and burns a little but other than that it gets le job done I'm impressed with how my skin feels after using this product. Usually clay masks are pretty drying. This is the least drying clay mask I've used. And for some reason, I absolutely love the texture! It's kind of like whipped cream cheese but more powdery. I'm becoming more and more of a fan of Derma Nu's products. They are very high quality. This is no exception. The ingredients are excellent and my skin looks excellent. Will definitely be repurchasing. I tend to have greasy skin and I generally like clay masks since they help getting rid of excess grease. This is an excellent choice if you are looking for a mask that will help with outbreaks and dry up your t-zone. You apply on a clean face, so use your regular wash first, it stings pretty badly for the first minute or two after you apply. You should leave it on for 15-30 minutes, so it dries. Once the time is up you wash of the mask, I would suggest using a facial crème after since is does leave you face fairly dry. Silky soft skin in minutes! I'm not one to sit around with clay on my face, so I was up and about the house with mine on. Thankfully, it didn't flake off or anything crazy!I did get a little bit in my eye somehow, but it was easily flushed, and didn't have that nasty burning sensation some other masks do. If you've ever used one from a store- you know what I'm talking about.I think I can get at least 5 masks from this container. I really enjoy how my skin feels after this one! I love pampering myself and this mask did that.  It smells nice and feels great.  It made a huge difference after using it just one time.  One of the most important things to me is how my skin handles a product because it is so sensitive and I had no problems using this.  I am looking forward to another night of pampering. I LOVE clay masks. I've used alot of various products and this is I'm the top 3 of masks! It toned my skin along with a really deep pore cleansing. Love it!I received this product at discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I have tried many other Clay masks before. This one by far is the best. my skin was smooth, soft and shinny. Highly recommand and will def. try again. This is a really nice clay mask. I felt my skin was deep cleansed and refreshed. I got this product under a promotional offer. I enjoyed the way mineral Clay mask felt on my face.  I am a big believer in facial mask and this product worked great. Love the texture!.  Only used twice,  but it is working well.  It is also easy to wash off unlike some other mask. Feels amazing on your skin Made my skin feel alsort of sort and silky! Not sure if it did much else after just using it once put it was fun for girls night ! I did receive for a small discount but the options are my own"
B00PYK2UI6," I have struggled with blackheads for my entire life.  I've tried everything from different face washes to blackhead eliminating pore strips.  Within just two weeks of using this brush both in the morning and evening, my blackheads are completely gone. I have NEVER been this happy about a face cleansing product...ever! 2:200:00This video is not intended for all audiences.

My teenage daughter has acne and I have large, visible pores.  A salesperson at a department store wanted me to buy one but I just didn't want to spend that kind of money (around $100).  I really wanted to give one of these a try to see if it could help.This kit is even better than others I have looked it.  It has different brushes but is really a whole body kit.  It comes with the cleaning unit, one big body brush, one sensitive skin face brush, one small face brush, and one pumice.  So you can do your face, whole body and feet with this one set.  It's very easy to use.  The attachments just pop onto the end and you press the power button.  I use my normal facial soap on it and get it good and wet then move it all over my face.  I have figured out how hard to press the unit to my face based on what feels comfortable for me.  My daughter uses the regular face brush and I use the sensitive one.  I feel like when I am done that my face is so much cleaner than just washing with my hands or a washcloth.  My daughter uses it once a day in the evenings when washing her face.  I do use a make up remover first  then use the brushing system.  After you are done, you rinse the brush off and store.  The unit is water proof and can be used wet or dry and with or without soap.If you are looking for an affordable brushing system, I would recommend giving this one a try.  It has definitely earned 5 stars in my book!Sample purchased at a reduced rate in exchange for evaluation and my honest, unbiased review. I am very pleased with this product. I used it daily starting off, but realized that that was too much. I use the Spin Brush once, or twice a week and find that works better and the right products. For me, my skin is sensitive, so I do not use the brush daily and for a long period of time. I use it to do a basic exfoliation and that is for one to two minutes and that's it. I have a scar near my jawline that I got from chemical peels and a hyper-pigmentation that resulted from this area being exposed to the sun. The brush has stimulated healing and as a result has begun to peel, lighten and minimize the scar. IT is a long process, but this product along with better skin care with the Cerave line has done wonders for my skin, Love this!. I even caught my husband using it and he is the one of those wash cloth and a bar of soap works fine kinda people. I wish it had a little more speed to it but hey for the price you cant beat it. It is really good on batteries and I have even dropped it in the shower a couple times and it has lived to tell the tale. WOW!  I can't say enough great stuff about this brush and I've only used it 2x.  After the very first use, my face had a wonderful, rosy glow.  Even my lips looked nice and rosy ...How is that possible?  Don't know, but I love it!  Also, I applied my usual oils afterward and they soaked right in.  Typically, I have to use a ton of tissue to wipe off the excess oil before applying my make-up, but apparently, no more!  I'm guessing that now the oils, moisturizers, etc. can now get absorbed into my skin and do the job they are supposed to.  In any event, I am thrilled.  I should also add that the skin on my arms also transformed immediately.  This time of year they always get dry and a little wrinkly, but after the first treatment, they looked like they belonged to someone (much younger) else.  I still have brown spots, but if it's not my imagination, I think they have diminished as well.  One more thing - the customer service is amazing.  I received an email the day I was supposed to receive my brush encouraging me to contact the representative if I had any problems, questions, or concerns.  She also gave me a heads up on how to open the brush to get the batteries in.  So far, that's the only thing I had any kind of problem with - it's a bit tricky to get the battery compartment open, but in fairness, after washing and drying my hands really well and trying again, it wasn't so bad.  Again, LOVE THIS BRUSH!!  One more thing - the price ...THANK YOU!!! I love this system.  Easy to use and as someone who has always fought with acne, it has made such an amazing difference in the tone and texture of my skin and the breakouts have decreased significantly.  I use it 2-3 times a week on my face and my skin definitely has a much more youthful look.  I'm ordering kits for my family for Christmas. Love this set i mostly use the body brush which makes my skin so soft and the face brush for sensitive skin is just great. it have definately reduced my breakouts and makes my face really smooth and gives a clean feel. I use it in the shower and it works great, if you are looking for a cleansing kit at a great cost i highly recommend this one. Great brush for the price. I use it once a week and it really helps to exfoliate my dry, cystic acne prone skin. I was worried it would be too rough, but just the regular brush head works fine on my sensitive skin. Going to be buying more of these for bridesmaids gifts! I bought this to use as an exfoliating face brush, but I was shocked how much I enjoy using it to exfoliate the rest of my body.  I use the small brush for my face and the large brush for my body.  After a long day working (and swearing) in the garden, it's great to jump in the shower and use the body brush to hit my back/shoulders/neck with the rotating brush and clear away all the sunscreen and dead skin cells.  I really like the whole kit and think that it's a great value for the price. I like this product it cleanse my face nicely and leaves my skin so smooth. The customers service of this company is amazing I had some issues with my brush so I contacted them and they sent out a replacement kit for me the next day.  I couldn't be happier with this purchase. Thiscompany really cares about it's customer. Yes I  recomend this product and I will buy again and a gain from this company I wasn’t sure what I was getting into when I ordered this kit, but I’m so glad I did!! It comes with several different jobs. Most importantly it comes with a brush specifically for sensitive skin. It’s waterproof so you can use it in the shower and you can use My skin is so soft and this makes exfoliating not such a chore.  I would suggest that someone use this only if they understand they're own skin and how it reacts... and especially understand how often to exfoliate.  Don't overdo it because it's easy to get carried away with this but adding it to my routine has helped so much. Love this brush does everything I want for my face. My skin is much clear and helps with the oil build up on my face. I use the other brushed as well and I love them. There is a soft face brush and a harder face brush. I use the soft one for dry brushing my face and the harder one when I am washing my face. I use the foot brush too but it's not that great. If you want to lightly buff your feet it does an okay job. I have been using this product for 4 months now and  I haven't had a problem. I have submerged it in the shower and the batteries haven't died yet. Good deal! I was pleasantly surprised.  This is exactly what I was looking for....  Price is great. It was received quickly, and works great.The brush actually moves, so you have to be careful not to overdo.  There is no timer, so don't use too long. Directions are vague, feels like the old complexion brushes, like a baby brush.  Body brush is great, haven't used pedicure bush yet.A bargain for the money!!! Great kit with quality brushes at a good price (1 brush for sensitive, 1 large body, and one regular) plus exfoliating pumice that is very effective on calluses.  If HAVING PROBLEMS OPENING IT just put a RUBBER BAND around the battery compartment handle and push it open -- I use the wide bands that come on vegetables and it works fine with less strength.  It would help if the sensitive skin brush was marked as such but that's minor -- you can always use a sharpie on the back.  It's still working great over a year later.  PS. I use rechargeable batteries. Well, I am 54 years old and used this once, and loved how my face felt. My daughter , 15 yrs.old used a different brush on face- sensitive- acne on forehead and liked how ir felt. We will see. There are brushes for face and body. We will see. Thanks. I have now been using the brush for 'not sensitive skin 'for 2 weeks and my skin is definitely smoother and feels better. It has a very healthy glow and I have not put any face powder,cover up or concealer. This is an amazing product. The first week, I had new breakouts as the build up was sloughed away, but now...blackheads almost completely gone, skin glows and is really soft. The body brush is fantastic to use on legs for a silky smooth shave. Love the assortment of brushes and that it can hang in my shower.  My box didn't have pamphlet explaining how to use i.e. only use once a day or a brochure for ordering replacement brushes, but I was able to find this information online.  Great value. I am in love with this exfoliating brush... I use it every day,  it has now been six months since my purchase and it is still running on the same batteries, also i have dropped it in the shower several times and it is still working perfectly.I have been acne free for months now and my natural skin glow has returned, before I had tons of cystic acne, and let me tell you it has taken  it all away! it is currently helping get rid of my acne marks and has reduced my pores immensely.  I have purchased two so far one for my sister and one for me now I am looking to getting a third one for my mom. This kit is really a great value for everything that comes with it. After using this product just once I received compliments on my skin the day after!! My skin feels and looks so clean. I use a Vitamin C serum after using the brush and I can honestly tell the difference from when I just wash my face and apply vs using the brush then applying. I definitely recommend this kit, you can't go wrong with the price!!! Works really well. Made my skin look and feel great. This cleansing brush has changed my life. I have a Fit Me 355 Coconut (toned), acne prone skin, that has suffered through acne ever since my menstrual at age 8. I had combination skin, with huge pores, lots of spots and discoloration. I've been using this product 5 months and to be honest my skin is nearly to the point where it looks like when I was a child. The brush truly deep cleans my skin. My skin tone has changed, I barely get breakouts, and my pores are slowly going always thanks to my new routine centered around this brush. I don't even even have to do face masks anymore. The only thing I do twice a day is cleanse with the brush, toner, and moisturize with oil (yes I use this every day or else I'll breakout). My skin texture has changed, and my foundation always looks much better. This is something I want to use for the rest of my life. This comes with a wrist strap so you won't drop it and that really helps. This product went beyond my expectations. This product helped my teen daughter with her acne on her face and back. Works as written and quite a nice price for the quality. She is more confident and has made using this part of her daily facial regiment. Some brush heads are hard but I suspect that they will loosen with regular usage. The brushes for the face don't seem to matter in the long run so it really doesn't make sense to have a face brush and a sensitive brush as they both look the same and are not labeled as to which is which. However with all that said I enjoy the product so far it cleans the pores and works great as a foot buffer, I have yet to use the body brush, but look forward to clean skin in the future. This is a powerful brush when used with the small facial tips.  The big tip (for body) tends to stop spinning when you apply pressure.  But, it's a wonderful tool for the face.  Unfortunately, mine stopped working after about a month.  However, the company immediately sent a replacement.  I'm keeping this one dry because I do feel using it in the shower might have been the cause.  The battery compartment doesn't have a 100% water-tight seal.  I've had the new one for a little over a month and it is working fine.  I hope the first product was an anomaly because I really like it.  It is so helpful for exfoliating my face. I have used body and face brushes, All I can say is thank you so much for getting my face back to some type of normal. I use Elizabeth arden and products and is correct your skin, so guess what all that years of damage does, well it starts peeling off and when you have dry skin it looks horrible, well ordered this little machine and now my skin is perfect, it was the missing link. When I have time I will try the stone I was amazed at how my skin felt. Super smooth and clean. Plus with the use of batteries no need to worry about charging, or over charging to the point where the internal battery will die. Honestly I am happy with the results I am getting and won't be spending hundreds of dollars on something else. I am over 60 so I have mature sensitive skin, and use the softest brush in the package. I bought 2 of these as Christmas gifts for my teen daughters. They both absolutely love them and have seen a felt a difference in their skin. I used one a few nights ago and could not believe how amazing and soft my skin felt afterwards. My face serum seemed to sink in so much faster too. These were money well spent. I use this on my face because of oil accumulating in the pores on my nose, making my nose look like a strawberry.  I use the gentle brush daily and helps reduce the look of a ""spotted"" nose.  Very difficult to open for battery placement, but I suppose that difficulty insures the product to be waterproof. This facial and body cleansing brush works great. The different heads interchange easily. It is a little difficult to identify which facial brush should be used for exfoliation versus regular cleansing as they are very similar. The body brush is great. The whole unit can be used in the shower without incident. Works great and the price can't be beat. As a guy, I try to keep this thing hidden from my friends, but I have issues with acne and I've tried many different things. This is awesome for cleaning your face. I actually use it about twice a week with the sensitive skin brush. My face gets very oily. This does a great job of unclogging my pores, removing dead skin from acne, and giving you a relaxing feeling. For guys, I think this might be a great way to prepare for face before shaving. I rarely use the body brush, but it does a nice job of exfoliating as well. I ordered this product a few weeks ago because I had been experiencing a series of breakouts and I waited to review so that I could give an honest opinion. I have been using this brush for almost a month and  i can honestly say that I love it! The brushes are gentle enough for sensitive skin but yet still make for a great exfoliating experience. I have seen great results using this brush and aloe vera gel ;my face has a natural glow now. I will be ordering again. This is the best!  It made my skin so soft really cleaned it well. I have acne so that means bad scars and pimples,  well this really has helped it opens my pores and allows the acne medication to really get in.  The body scrub made me soft as a babies bottom! My husband really liked it after he was done shaving.  The foot scrub is also nice! Only complaint is how to get the battery cover off we figured it out but it's tricky.  Also use good batteries otherwise it loses umph quick. Love this!  Love that it came with 4 different heads to use.  Was worried the facial one might be rough, but was just right.  The pumice one for my feet isn't as rough as they need, but that might be due more to the batteries and the condition of my heels, overall though it does a great job and I'm pleased with my purchase. My son loves this it cleared his acne right up.  He uses this with his generic orange color salicylic acid facial wash.  His complexion completely smooth out not visible black heads. Works great , I was hesitant @ first but I'm glad that I was able to buy it. I read some of the reviews, I was a little bit skeptical but gave it a chance and when I got it, I must tell you it works wonderful. I love it ,I love it, it makes your body so clean and soft I highly recommend. I have to say that this product truly did exceed my expectations. solidly built, quiet and definitly no toy. The follow up email from the seller had very good tips with plenty of contact info. Packaged well and prompt shipping. very happy. be prepared it is tough to open for batteries, being waterproof it has to fit tightly. This works very well and I can really see a difference in my skin now. It has helped clean my skin deeply and my adult acne breakouts are starting to clear since I started using this in combination with an acne set. Love it, can't wait to use the body and foot attachments! I made the mistake of using this every day which was causing breakouts. I started using this brush every 3 days and my breakout cleared up. It left my skin feeling super smooth and clean looking. Definitely recommend. The brush I purchased quit working within two weeks of receiving it.  HOWEVER, the seller immediately sent me a new brush by priority mail.  No questions were asked and I did not have to return the malfunctioning product.I have now been using the replacement brush for several months and it works FABULOUSLY!  It feels so nice on my sensitive skin.  The brushes are not stiff and harsh on the skin, like some complexion brushes are.  This is a lovely set with 3 brush attachments and a pumice stone attachment.  I only use the system twice a week; because, I read that over-exfoliation can be damaging to the skin. This softly stimulates circulation, gently sloughs off dead skin and makes my skin feel like silk, afterwards.  I highly recommend this product and this seller. The seller is the best, and so is the product. It arrived in perfect shape, in a beautiful box, two days after I ordered it. The product works amazingly, and the seller followed up with the nicest, most thoughtful letter to me, making sure I am having the best buying experience. The Essential Skin Solutions is the best of the exfoliating machines that I have tried over the years. It's gentle enough the use under your eyes (one of my long-standing milia popped!), and tough enough to use the pumice attachment on my feet. I really enjoyed using it all over my body in the bath just now. My skin is ultra smooth, and I think I look younger already! Thanks! I just purchased my second brush for my husband who keeps swiping mine.  The brush is great, but the best part about buying from this company is how wonderful and personable they are.  They care very much about their product and customer satisfaction.  A welcoming email arrives about the same time as the brush and they give you tips and reminders about how they want you to be happy.  You just can't help but like them!!!!  Great product, great company! I have only used it occasionally but it seems to be doing some good.  Thinking of exfoliating the dead stuff off your face, this will do it.  Got it wet in the shower, dropped it and the batteries went everywhere.  Still works fine.  I am good with this purchase. I've been using this brush for about 2 weeks now, and I can already see a HUGE difference in my skin! I mostly bought this brush to help combat my back acne, which is worse now at the age of 25 than it was when I was a teenager. Gross. Anyway, I've had tons of pimples on my shoulders for the past few months, and after trying just about everything to stop them, this brush finally seems like the winner. While the brush handle doesn't provide a ton of reach, it's perfect for getting my shoulders, and the larger body brush feels great! My skin feels very clean (I usually use it with Neutrogena Redness Soothing Acne Wash), and my acne has improved noticeably! My skin is smoother, my pimples are fading, and I absolutely love it!The smaller face brushes are nice too, but the skin on my face is a lot more sensitive, so I don't use the brush on my face very often. The first time I used it, I used the small brush with the harder bristles, and it made my face feel so clean, it was unbelievable. But after that, a couple days later, I used the brush with the softer bristles (which is for sensitive skin), and my face still felt clean, but it also made my face feel a little irritated. If you have sensitive skin, just be careful, and only use the softer brush (and maybe only use it once a week, at least to start).Also, I have a few pimples on my chest occasionally, so I tried to use the brush there, but it just ended up making my skin red and irritated for a little while. It wasn't a disaster, but just be aware that the skin on your chest is often a LOT more sensitive than skin on your back or elsewhere, so just be really careful if you're using this brush there.Bottom line, this brush is great, especially for the price. Your skin will feel clean and refreshed, and if you have acne, this brush will do a TON to help clear it up! Bought to use while doing the obagi nu derm system. So many peelies on my face..and strict instructions not to pick. Used the sensitive brush gently with the Obagi cleanser...really reduced the flakes and did not irritate my skin. I will use as needed durIng the duration of the nu derm..Then the standard brush for maintenance. The body brush and pumice are great extras..especially in winter! Great product! It came right on time and the product was exactly as pictured and described. I've bought a body brush on Amazon previously and it didn't live up to my expectations at all, but this is a great product that I will continue to use! Love it! I've used other brushes like this before but was impressed with the power it has, this is the first one I've been truly happy with. My skin feels very smooth after only using it for a few days. This is a really great addition to any skin care routine Great product. For people will chronic pimples and acne problem. This helps clear the face opening pores healing dead skin leave your face smooth, using this in addition with other products guarantee improvement to the face. I bought for girlfriend and she later bought a second one for her younger sister whose face is pimples-ing due to adulthood Have been using this for the last month and I am disappointed in myself for not trying this sooner! My pores have reduced in size and my acne subsided as well. Haven't had to change the batteries yet either. Great price! Highly recommend! I absolutely love all the different attachments! The body brush is great for exfoliating my skin. I get waxed pretty regularly and would get asked all the time if I'm exfoliating enough because I would have ingrown hairs. Once I started using this before my waxing no more comments about ingrown hairs - win win! I use the soft face brush for everyday use and the regular face scrub brush once a week with my exfoliating facial scrub wash! My skin has never felt so smooth and clean! This facial and body brush are great I have seen and even my husband noticed my skin looks healthier and smooth.helped with the dry skin really good.it really prepares your face for your skin regime.use the regular face brush few times a week and in between use the sensitive  brush.the body brush works great too,I use it with my homemade body scrub.definitely recommend this(even helped my son with his acne,his face cleared up nicely. Read the directions before use. I used a thick apricot scrub to exfoliate with and it caked into the base of the bristles  (just like the instructions said it would). I like this product and would recommend. I received the item on Friday(very quickly), I used it that night! I didn't read the instructions first so I didn't know that I should have removed my makeup first.. :( The makeup did stain the brush a little but not too bad. I read the directions after and saw that it recommends removing make up first. After I rinsed my face my skin feel wonderful! So far I love it! Now I need to find a spot to keep it in my bathroom... LOVE this product. Especially for the price. I haven't tried the more expensive ones but I wouldn't waste my money one one because I'd say they do the same thing. I love how it comes with a regular and a gentle for your face. It feels good and comfortable in your hand and the speed is perfect. I would def recommend to my friends and family and would defiantly re purchase! Great Product! I was amazed after the very first use. My face cleaning steps were first to remove all makeup using my make up remover. Next, I washed my face with my high end cleanser using my fingers as I typically would. Finally, I added more of my high end cleanser to the soft face brush and gave my face a cleaning. I was shocked that the brush had turned brown as if I had never removed the makeup. It was evident that my face hadn't had a deep cleaning in some time.  I love the product because its like having the ability to give myself a deep cleansing facial any time I want.  I am very particular about keeping my face and neck clean and it is good to know that this product goes hand and hand with my daily regiment.  In addition the price is great considering systems of this nature usually sell for much more. I Love it,  I notice that most customers were unhappy with this product because of it not being water proof. A month later and it's working, I don't shower with it and I use only to cleanse my face before bed and I don't fully wet the whole thing just the brush. Overall, I love it and it works great and leaves my skin smooth and clean! Wow, results after one use. It was used at bedtime and in the morning skin was soft, smooth and over half of the acne and blackheads were gone. All the inflammation was gone as well. My daughter is thrilled! I was extremely surprised by this one. For w0 dollars I got 4 brush heads, 3 for face 1 for foot and the face ones are perfect for my sesitive skin This product is amazing!! I had many different things wrong with my skin.. Acne on my chin, blackheads on my nose and discoloration on different parts of my face, bumps on the back of my arms and thighs.. This has gotten rid of everything!! I use standard clean and clear facial wash and that it. This has given my skin renewal and glow! Love love this product I have terribly dry skin and am amazed by how different it felt after my first use. I've been using the brush regularly now for almost a month. My skin is much brighter, retains moisture better than ever, and appears tighter...just like they say it would. I use the sensitive brush for my face and have had no issues with irritation. A friend of mine has VERY sensitive skin. She said her's left her face a bit pink, but said it went away quickly. The pumice head is excellent at removing well soaked callused skin. I use it in the shower and have to say my feet have never looked better. I bought mine two years ago. I use it about twice a week. Love the pressure. It's not too harsh it's just right. I would recommend over other more expensive brands. If it looses power, pop in some new battery's So far I only use the body brush on this and I LOVE IT. It is not too soft and not too harsh it is perfect. It exfoliates my skin daily which help with dry and itchiness in the winter months. Surprisingly it also does a great job at exfoliating the heels of my feet. I cant wait to try the pumice stone and the other brushes. Also battery life is great, so far I have used it daily for almost a month now and it is still going strong! Can't live with out this. Great quality and great customer care. This was a Christmas present for my granddaughter and I was worried it would embarrass her. No problem she loved it and had fun experimenting the different brushes. She's really a tween and we've had trouble getting her to start washing her face every night. So far so good, this is fun to use and her acne has improved. I was debating whether to buy the brand name version, that is more expensive, or this one. After having both of them in my hands and using both, I can tell you that this one work as well, if not better, than the other one. Great product, good quality and 100% water proof. I was slightly hesitant to order this, but I'm so glad I did! As a 32 yr old with adult acne, I can tell you this is one beauty tool i found about 20 years too late. I use tretinoin, which is a cream prescribed for acne. Although it works, it causes skin to constantly be dry and flaky. This tool helps to gently slough it away without being to harsh on my face. I like that it comes with multiple brush heads, and I use them all! The pumice stone works great on feet, and the larger brush is great for the entire body.I've noticed that on some reviews people complain about the speed, but I think it's fine... The only time I've noticed a lack in power or speed is when the batteries are dying. Unless you are looking for something with the power of a belt sander (which, for my face, I am not, lol!), this tool will suffice :)The waterproof aspect is also great. I usually keep this in my shower and use it when I wash my face. Obviously it's not meant to be submerged, but the battery compartment is tightly sealed and keeps the moisture out.I love this brush and have noticed an improvement in my skin. It's well made and seems like it will last a long time. I also love the box it came in. It was well packaged in a sturdy box, which I still use to store the brushes. Overall, a great purchase! Love this product.  I think it is an excellent cleansing system-really makes me feel clean especially getting the remaining make-up off my face after I have removed my make-up with special remover.  You can really tell this item deep cleans your face and would recommend this to anyone who is unhappy with just regular washing-I never realized that my cleanser was not removing all of my make-up at night until I used this product. I love it! I started using it a week ago and I see AMAZING RESULTS. My skin cleared a lot and I see red spots from acne starting to fade. I get pimples every month around my chick bones and chin and they usually leave red marks so this brush helps a lot to fade them quickly. Ii is not harsh on your skin, but it makes you feel fresh and clean. Very easy to use and to clean. Great product! This brush is amazing. It is water truly water proof and has great power. The selection of bristles is amazing for the price and the function of this brush it top notch. It is pretty gentle on my face and really does make a difference. I love this product and I wouldn't hesitate buying it again. The brush heads are great- one is softer, one is more exfiliating. The more exfoliating brush head actually really scrubs very deeply, which I haven't found true of other facial brush systems. I like it very much..I just would like to know what ya mean buy cleaning it..how do you do that? So far so good I use it every night in the shower I can see the difference. my skin is flawless and I know why :) I tried out this body/face cleansing brush immediately after receiving it. My skin feels extremely clean. I am very pleased with this item as it performs very well so far, for a very reasonable price, compared to a major competitor currently being advertised. I need to find out if replacement brush heads are offered... and a handle attachment would be a big plus, too, for body (back) washing... Wishful thinking perhaps. this is the only face brush that I've tried, so I can't compare it. but I am very satisfied with this product. it's simple and easy and it can go in and out of the shower! I think my only suggestion to the company, is to deliver it in a package that is easy to store. my detachments just float around in the draw and I want a separate container to put it in (so that my foot stone doesn't touch my face brush 8-/ ) I love this cleansing brush! I use it almost daily, and I have sensitive skin. My face feels so clean after I use it. The body attachment isn't bad either. I have another face brush that vibrates and doesn't spin. It cost about $60. This less expensive one is far better, hands down. This is a wonderful and complete face and body brush product. Love it so much, worth every penny and it wasn't that much to begin with.  Highly recommend. I LOVE THIS BRUSH SYSTEM!! I like the large brush on most days and i switch to the small brushes every so often. The small brushes get into creases better but they are much softer. I know you should not use abrasive brushes on your skin but i feel cleaner with the large brush. Most days i use it twice a day.  Be sure to put in your warranty asap. The tool for body exfoliation works wonders on getting a spray tan off! I've always had a hard time getting the excess tan off your ankles and wrists and it gets it's right off. It does exfoliate your face very well! Don't push too hard though. It actually ended up irritating my face and making it more flaky when I pushed the bristles too hard in my face I wanted a facial brush, but did not want to invest a large amount of money.  This brush, so far, has proven to be a good value; I like it, it works.  The storage box is very nice and sturdy.  This set comes with a body brush attachment, a pumice stone, and two facial brushes.  I am only interested in using the facial brushes.My reason for the purchase was to have a way to quickly scrub my face and still be able to go deep into pores, especially on the nose tip.  Exfoliating the skin was not my purpose in making this purchase, although it will do this if used for a longer duration.  I use it for only about 1 minute maximum.  Using a liquid face soap (not one with scrubbing beads) I very quickly, and using a light touch, make circular motions all over my face (avoid eye areas) foaming the soap into a nice lather and then rinsing and patting the skin dry.  So far, I have used this brush daily and have seen wonderful results.  Short duration and a light touch will allow for daily use, especially if being used with the sensitive skin brush included.In using a magnifying mirror I can see that my nose tip pores are completely clear and clean, as are all the others, and my pores overall appearance has improved quite a bit.  I use a Pore Refining Daily Cleanser and together with this facial brush have seen very good results.Using a light touch and not going beyond 1 minute is the only way I can get away with using this facial brush on a daily basis.  Any longer duration and any firmer touch would possibly irritate my skin. Also, the amount of liquid soap used is about the size of a small green pea.  To get a really good rinse, I use the hand sprayer at the kitchen sink. I LOVE IT.! Every attachment works great... My Mother has callus and and I went straight for the foot attachment to test the product. Although I still used other scrubbers This work GREAT.. No Im not getting paid to say this Im a shopper who doesn't play when It comes to spending my money, I hate wasting it, but this  is def not a waste. They warn of the exfoliating brush hurting your skin at first but its not hurtful at ALL.. Maybe its because I usually exfoliate with products but its not painful or anything. The only problem I had was if you bare down tomuch on the brush  it messes with the spinning of the brush.  I recommend going against the spin of the brush I got good results that way with the body attachment. I'm so in love with this product. I wish I would've start using one of these are long time ago. Just after the first use my skin was soft and not so oily. And it's clearing my face up. I love the body brush too. But don't let me forgot about the part for my feet, I will not be spending money at the salon to get my feet scrubbed my feet is baby soft after the first use. Please give this a try u won't regret it. Really nice and inexpensive facial brush. I have used now for a while and it has made a difference in my facial cleansing routine and made the texture better. I also used the pumice stone on my feet which was good. Great product, I used the normal one at first, but my skin is sensitive so I used the brush for sensitive skin, works like a charm. The big brush did really wash and massage my neck nicely. So excited!! My teenage daughters have been wanting this for about a year now. My husband has been looking for the right one, and I came upon this on Amazon. We've all been using it and our skin feels wonderful. My daughter who is not the most coordinated loves this product! We're thinking of getting a second one, because we keep fighting over this at night!! I held off on writing a review until I had used a few weeks.  I've had it about a month now, and I can say my skin looks clearer, pores are smaller, I do think some of the lines are diminishing somewhat.  I haven't used the pumice stone for the feet, as I already had a good foot care regimen, but the face and body brushes are working really well for my 55 year old skin. Great cleansing system! Skin feels wonderful after using and definitely notice great improvement in skin tone. This a great set at a fantastic price! It has been only a week and I can already feel my skin smooth and supple. I am using it twice a day with the softest brush because it did not seem strong enough to cause any dermabrasion. Instead, it seems to clean the skin quite well. I now have smaller pores and a glowing skin! I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this product because it was not over a hundred dollars...but it works AMAZING, I used the body brush and sensitive skin attachments and the effect was IMMEDIATE and noticable...I have dark skin with large pores and oily skin, and everything looks so awesome and my vitamin c treatment that I use regularly absorbed so well I got compliments immediately.  Great.buy. Wife loves it and works like how it is described. Absolutely love this product! I love smooth and clean my skin feels after a use. Also love how this product comes with several brushes and not just for your face. I would highly recommend this product! Very surprised at what it can do. I previously had the clarisonic, but never liked it. The brush head on the clairsonic was too big and the shape didnt fit the hand that well. With this new brush, the ergonomics is much better. and you can swap the battery out. The clairsonic had a glued in battery that dies after a year anyhow, forcing you to buy a new one or hack it up. So far so good. Cleaning out the pores. I got this for Christmas and I am already in love. My face feels so much cleaner and it's so gentle. The pumice works ok, it's my least favorite option in the set but I still use it and would recommend this as a great starter kit or for someone who really needs to wash their face well. recommend!! i use it on my face and body, and it leaves my skin so clean, i have acne so i use it 3 times a week and it has helped alot Very useful, especially in the shower. Use a dab if facial wash, press the button, and exfoliate. It has other attachments and they all work great . waterproof also, but haven't dropped it in the tub though. I'm using rechargeable batteries with this unit. Love this product. Works beautifully and the follow up from the buyer was amazing. She went out of her way to email me to make sure I was satisfied and to give me more information about the product as well as offering to answer any additional questions. She stood behind the value and quality of the product and I will definately do business again. I've been using Amazon to purchase products for years and this is this first time a buyer has taken the time to do this. Thank you. I am so happy I decided to get this. Solid, well made and durable. My skin is much smoother and feels so much nicer. I feels clean and lighter. Love it! After trying this product for the first time , it left my skin very clean and soft. It also comes with various scrubs for different parts of the body . I used it on my face , so far it works great. You will have to buy a face lotion of your preference to scrub your face. The price is also great. Great gift for guy or girl. I absolutely love this brush you don't realize how much dirt is left on your skin from the typical face cloth until you use one of these brushes I will be using a brush on my face for life! Love this! Its a must for my every day beauty regime. I have had facial brushes in the past and mainly bought this for the body brush, but I absolutely love everything in this kit. I have super sensitive skin and was a little worried the first time I used the facial brush, but I swear, some of the dark spots were not even noticeable. I have had the kit about a week now and use it every day with a sensitive skin foaming cleanser and my skin looks amazing. This has really helped clear my skin and get deep into pores. After using this for 2 weeks, I noticed that I only have bumps on my face that are very deep and need time to surface. This helps with blemishes, white heads, cleansing, and feeling a great sense of clean. I don't use the sensitive skin brush, and I section my face for about 30 seconds at a time. I haven't used the body one yet, but that will be my next test. Good cleaning product, feels like it goes deeper than your hands would with cleaning without it going too far and irritating your skin or being too exfoliating. I love this product so much for myself and my son. His face is broken out from sweat of playing basketball all day everyday and this helps I love this! This is the same quality as the $100 ones I've seen on blogs- I think it is the exact same, in fact, with just a different logo smacked on to it. Super good quality- and the batteries last forever before you have to change them! Great product. Sturdy and waterproof. I've used every attachment and am pleased with all of them. My acne has cleared up with regular use. I ordered 2 of these by mistake. Good thing! I was one gift short for Christmas! She and I both love them! Great for exfoliating the body and facial cleansing. This is really helping my skin and I have always had problem skin.  It is gently exfoliating and applying salycilic acid and glycolic acid after is keeping my blackheads and zits at bay. I have used both face brushes for about a week and am pleased with the results. My face feels smooth and not dried out. I am 62 and have always had enlarged pores and combination skin. The company seems genuinely interested in client satisfaction and feedback.  Highly recommend. Great deal for the price. I used this for the first time today. I love how my skin feels. The brush feels durable and despite the softness of the brush, it exfoliated and deep cleansed my face wonderfully. Absolutely recommend this product!  I wear makeup daily and hate taking it off at night.  Seems difficult to get it all off of my skin.  I had acne growing up, but no longer do except for breakouts on my chin around that time of the month or if I get lazy and sleep with my makeup on (I know, very bad).  I used to use Proactiv and other topical acne medicines, but they became too harsh for my skin.  Also, I'm 27 years old and want to prevent signs of aging as well as reduce sun spots.First use: I did my normal makeup remover wipe, wet my skin, wet the sensitive skin brush head, added a couple pumps of Cetaphil and started cleaning.  The brush felt amazing on my skin and I could feel my face getting super clean.  I only brushed for 1 minute and rinsed.  The brush took off every single bit of makeup and my skin felt SO smooth.  I let my skin dry naturally (no towel drying - *read the post from the cosmetologist*) which I have been doing my entire life.  Towels can harbor bacteria even after one use and your skin wants to soak up the liquid left on your face.  I followed with an anti-aging moisturizer and eye cream.I only use the brush 1 or 2 times a week, but after the first week I definitely see a noticeable improvement in my skin.  My face is extremely smooth, pores on my nose are less visible, zero breakouts and my makeup glides on so smoothly in the morning.  Overall, very pleased with this product and I can't wait to try the body brush on my legs and the pumice stone on my feet.**As for people negatively commenting on the brush's waterproof feature...I don't know about you, I don't care what the manufacturer says, I would never knowingly submerge a battery operated device under water.  Obviously if you accidentally drop it in the tub, that's on you.  I use mine in the shower and I leave it in a dry place afterward and it works just fine.The day my package arrived I received a very nice email from Alycia Shapiro, the founder of the company.  She gave additional instructions for each brush head as well as a handy tip for removing the battery case.  She also ensured customer satisfaction and asked that I email or call if anything goes wrong with the product.  That is OUTSTANDING customer service and it is few and far between these days.Thank you Alycia and thank you Best Skin for an excellent product and experience thus far. Love my new cleansing brush!  Works wonders on my keratosis pilaris, a skin condition w/no current cure. Furthermore,  I feel like the use of this product on my face prior to applying any type of facial serum, really allows for proper absorption. The soft brush is perfect for daily/showerly use. It's making my pores so much smaller and better with the whole acne situation. I've had this item for several months now and it's been working wonderfully. Definitely helps with my annoying whiteheads and I can tell a real difference when I don't use it for a few days, Don't know how I was satisfied with my face washing before this! This is really great! Exactly what I've been looking for. You can't beat the price. I would suggest Not using it everyday day. Maybe every other day or every few days. If you use it too much, it will take extra layers off your skin and then scab (oops!) I live in MN and my skin gets flakey from the cold, dry air. I use this in the shower a couple times a week and it's great with removing the flakes and making my skin smooth. Would recommend. I bought this product because I needed something to help scrub my pores. This works great especially when taking off makeup. I used to just wash my face with a washcloth and never knew how much build-up was actually left over until I use this. I haven't used all of the attachments. I only used the face scrubbers. This is the best skin product I use love it. I've only used this 3 times so far but I can honestly say I LOVE it!  One use on my body made my skin so soft and got rid of dry flakes.  My face has never felt so smooth.  I use this and then put Hyaluronic Acid Serum on and the next morning my face looks radiant.  I'm so happy with this purchase I'm going to buy another one for my daughter. Love this product. It has 2 brushes and a stone (great for heals/elbows). I use the softest facial brush daily and my skin seems to be improving. I get facials every now and then and at my last one she told me I had fewer blackheads and skin appeared to be much healthier. Only thing I would like to have had with this is cleansing pads as well as brushes. My clarisonic pro died and since they cost so much, I decided to try a different product. I love this thing. The real large brush is the best. Cuts down on the time to brush face. Easy setup, install batteries and go. GREAT PRODUCT. I've had this for a month. Use it about every other time I'm in the shower which is where it lives. So far I love it. Brushes are soft and easy to change. I bought this when one I was given crapped out in less than a month. This one seems MUCH more sturdy. This is very comparable to the vanity planet . I get a through clean every time I use it, it’s water proof and still working I really like this face and body brushes and you can't beat the price. Very fast shipping and the package came BRAND NEW! I must say after just one use I've seen a difference and It feels great on my skin and body.Would definitely recommend to a friend/family for sure. This has been great so far. I have very sensitive skin so most scrubs or anything abrasive does more damage than good. I have only used the sensitive brush on my face so far and it hasn't caused any discomfort. I'm already seeing a difference in my skins texture, it's becoming smoother and softer.  For the price you can't beat it. Nice product! I have sensitive skin & can't use scrubs. The first day I used the sensitive brush for 1-2 minutes. My skin was a little red for maybe a minute after, but my skin looked like I had gotten a facial!! I was shocked. Definately a great deal for the product I recieved. I have many uses for this; I use the brush on my face and the pumis for my feet and I have yet to use the dry brush but look forward to it. The price is great and the little motor is pretty strong. I have it over a year with no issues. I'd give this 10 if I could. If your interested in a face brush this is it. I was getting the clarisonic ($200) but decided I'd get this first. Im sticking with this now. Its amazing and comes with body heads. I wish it came with extra face heads because I'm sure they will have to be replaced soon but its worth it. I have horrible adult acne and its already started to clear in less than a week. Works as advertised. Very nice kit. Vendor is concerned with those who purchase their product by making sure it is used properly and providing a direct contact for questions or concerns. Wife likes this kit very much. I bought it for myself and it's completely changed my teens life. Her t zone was as bad as it can get this side of cystic acne. Her face is completely clear a month later. SO glad I purchased this. I use this for my face, feet and body. All of the attachments are perfect for the different uses. Great buy instead of the Sephora sets for such big money! Best way to clean your face i did not use The otter attachments. I am 60 years old and my skin looks like a baby skin I love this face cleaning brush!!! I used to hate washing my face because I was too lazy. But when I use this brush it feels great! My face feels so much cleaner, I got it almost 2 weeks ago and most of my acne has left my face! Awesome just Awesome! Love this!!!! I use it every other day on my face and once a week on my body. It has been life changing for me. I really love this brush. The body brush is so great for working on areas that might have raised bumps and smooths out your skin. I use the sensitive face brush and find that it has enough scrubbing power for my face. The pumice stone works wonder on my heels as well. I highly recommend this product. The product comes exactly as pictured in the ad pictured and was delivered very quickly. This worked pretty great for me and my Fiance, especially thanks to the extra heads - pumice for her, and the brushes to help relieve my skin condition. Heads have lasted pretty well, several months in haven't needed to buy replacement ones yet. Battery life was about average for something like this so no complaints here. Overall only a notch below those high end ones, which at this price is golden. I wanted this kind of brush for a while. I really like this brush. I didn't get a chance to write down a review right away but now I'm glad I can do it.Kit itself very nice. It has 2 small face brushes (1 is softer than another, for more sensitive skin) and 1 big body brash, also it has 1 stone.After cleaning first time I can definitely feel how my skin was more clean, than just with regular wash. Also it reduce the use of skin product. With regular wash I used 1-2 pumps to clean my face, but with this brush I need just a pea size amount of my product. That's awesome!! Let me save my money. It has only 1 speed, but for face wash it's fine. I will definitely recommend this brush and rate it 5 stars. Very sturdy nice product. Brushes aren't too hard or too soft. Great quality product first the price. I use in shower with no issues yet. I love this brush and use it almost everyday! It has definitely helped keep my skin clear of acne during the hot summer months. My skin always looks refreshed! Only used this a few times but so far I love it! I have fairly sensitive skin and the normal face brush was fine. It is tricky to get the battery compartment open, you have to squeeze the sides not the front/back. I ordered one for me and one for my daughter! She loves it and uses it twice a day. I use mine in the morning on my face and like the way it makes my skin feel. Nice product and the shipping was fast. It's also good that you can use it in the shower! Easy to use and makes the skin feel good! Received the kit on time. I have been using it daily. So far it's working great. It softens the skin and gets rid of unevenness. Love, love, love this thing. Use about every other day. Sometimes morning, sometimes night. The flakiness I was having with my skin is gone! Also noticed this helps stop any ingrown hairs in my beard. Truly don't know what I did without this all my life!?Yes, the brushes can be a little harsh. The more product you have on them, the better. It definitely have plenty of torque and I'm glad it doesn't spin any faster, because it can already make a mess with liquid flying off.UPDATE: A few months later, I still love this. Use it a few times a week. The only thing I thought was odd is, I can't really tell a difference between the two facial brushes. They seem pretty much the same to me.I have found this is the BEST THING EVER TO APPLY SHAVING CREAM!!!! I apply just 3 little dots of (expensive) shaving cream from The Art of Shaving Shaving Cream, Lemon, 5 fl. oz. and it's enough to do my whole face the first pass. One more drop and I can totally recoat my face. I don't have thick facial hair, so of course everyone else would be different.Another thing I have noticed is, if I use the nose pore strips on my nose, I get absolutely nothing out of my pores anymore after using the brush. I have been using different facial cleansers, but found Clinique to be my favorite. After I use the brush, I also put a light layer of the Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant, 2.6-Ounce on. It's pricy stuff, but one container of powder lasts a very very long time. I feel in my mid 30's, I look younger than I did 8 years ago. My skin is so much smoother and lines are disappearing, including a few light scars.Note: I also use CeraVe Moisturizers, Moisturizing Cream, 16 Ounce twice a day, after showers, shaves or exfoliations. I love the essential Skin Solutions skin brushing systems.  I continue to use the brushes, I maintain them by rinsing and air drying after each use. i love the way it makes my skin feel. I have been using this product for a few days now, I must say my face does feel a lot cleaner looks a lot brighter.One of my best purchases everrrr, Let me know if your company sells extra brushes I use coconut oil and oatmeal mixed and my face is now glowing. Great Product 2 thumbs up Have enjoyed using this on my face. I feel that my face is smoother and softer since using. I do not think that I have had as many break outs either. My face just feels cleaner The sensitive skin brush is perfect for exfoliating my sensitive skin. I love it. Also the body brush is amazing. my skin feels amazing after using this product for only a few days, super excited ! impressed with the results i am seeing in my skin so far.rotation speed is a bit slower than expected but overall great product My skin feels great.  I have been using this for a week now and my skin is much more even and smoother. I use it in the shower and is Feinstein water proof. Was a little worried at first but I love this product and great for the price. Has the power, can use is the shower, multi heads, it has really made a difference in only 4 days. I've had the 200+ one and the cheapy you get free from the acne skincare line- this blows them out of the water. Excellent service and product!! We also have a Clarisonic which was about $150.00. This unit was equally as good if not better and came with more attachments. My wife can't believe it for the price. We bought this one for our daughter and she loves it! Before I purchase this product I spent lots of mony on facial sessions wich was time consuming as well. But now since I used it for the first time I relaized that this product will save my mony and time. The price is lower than what I used to spent for one facial sessions. Using it with my favorite cleanser makes me feel fresh immediatly. I recommend it to my family and frinds also my sister is so excited to give it try, I think she will purchase it soon. This product really works in real life👍 Been using for a month and so far so good. It really helps keep my problem skin under control Have had this for a while now and wanted to hold off the review until I could really give an opinion.  I love the way my skin feels after using it, clean and rejuvenated.  Love that you can use the body brush in the shower.  Very stimulating. I love this thing. It doesn't rotate as fast as I thought it would. Even though I put a fresh new battery in it, maybe thats the problem? None the less, I love it. Cleans/sudses well. Love this works great and helps clear up acne and dry skin my skin glows after using Excellent facial and body brush. Love the pumice stone and the 2 different facial brushes.Have no problems what so ever. Easy warranty sign up on line. Just got my brush last week, I have already used it twice and already notice the difference. The Brush really cleans deep down in the pores and cleans them. It is compact and easy to use in the shower or at the sink, and doesn't get slippery when it's wet. I love this Brush and all the attachments and will definitely be using it for a long time I really like this product. It's much better than the claisonic that I had previously. I like that it has a pumice stone attachment and a body scrub attachment as well. It's a much deeper cleaner than anything I've had previously. I like it a lot! I use this every other day and my face and my skin is so soft! I really love the big brush too you can't not feel really clean after using it!  I haven't had a chance to use the pumice stone but I'm really excited to! excellent brush. I use it in my skincare practice and clients love how it feels. Bought this foe my 13 year old daughter who is starting to break out a little. She uses this every night and we have seen a decrease in her acne. my wife loves this. This leaves her facial skin very smooth and soft. Cleans away the oils and the dirt. I love it!! Just make sure you buy the 4 AA batteries! I almost didn't think of it! Love all the brushes. Not a fan of the pumice stone one; but I've never liked those anyway. All around nice product and very well priced! Also can use it in the shower!!!! Wonderful! This is actually the second time I have purchased this set. I absolutely love using this. My skin feels so clean after using. I use the big brush in the shower. My skin feels so smooth after use. i bought this brush on a whim after it was recommended that I purchase one to help with roscia. After 1 week of using it I noticed my face wasn't as red and my pores are barely visible. This brush also comes with different attachment heads so you can use it on your feet for dry skin.  The box it came on in sturdy and also serves for storage of the brush. Worth the money. The brushes are so soft I didn't think they would exfoliate but they actually do.Am p;eased with my purchase. Love it!! After using the sensitive skin brush on my face. My face feels so soft and my complexion is starting to look so much better! Amazing! I wasn't  happy with one brush and in a few days I received two new sets. Amazing company and amazing product! Great set with lots of attachments.  Good rotation.  Makes my skin smooth. Nice set. I have psoriasis so I decided that this might help with my ""patches"". Brushes are not too aggressive but not too wimpy either. The sensitive brush is ideal for my 60 year old face. Very easy to use and is soft on my skin.  It is very refreshing and easy to use. I think the pumice stone moves a little slow to be effective but love all the other attachments.  Would highly recommend it! Product arrive very fast (2 days) with no issues. I've tried all items and I'm very happy thus far. My face and body feels soft and clean after using and not stripped and dry as I thought it would by using the brushes daily. This product has definitely become part of my daily routine.  I also, really appreciate the seller reaching out to see if I had any questions and offering suggestion for use. 7:520:00This video is not intended for all audiences.

This does not come with AA batteries which are required.I would suggest using Alkaline if you have those laying around they last much longer than the regular AA.I would also suggest NOT using thicker cleaning face/body wash for this system or even lotions as they suggest it can shorten the life of your bristles & get stuck between the bristles.Something like a clean and clear thin liquid face wash consistency should work good.Overall I am very pleased with this system.I like the quality of the product,you get multiple use out of it (body/face/feet),waterproof, & most of all because it really does a great job at cleaning/prepping your skin for moisturizing it so you can get the maximum benefit from the creams you use afterwards.This is way better than manually trying to clean your face.Sample received at discount for inspection purposes. Great brush for your whole body. I was contemplating the sonic brush for a year but I just couldn't bring myself to pay that kind of money. I got this one and love it! Great price and the replacements are a good price too. i highly recommend this brush! You can feel and see the difference; within a few days my pores were tightened and skin felt a bit smoother. Works much better than just using your hands to wash your face. I purchased rechargeable batteries to cut the cost of replacing batteries in the future since this uses 4AA batteries. One suggestion however for the sellers, would be to attach a band to the handle so it can be hung up, or have a stand for it to be placed comfortably after use. Otherwise, great product! Would definitely recommend! I have been wanting to get one for some time now and finally after reading many reviews decided to get this brand. I don't know how well the others work, but I am very happy with this system. I use the facial brush 2-3 times a week, maybe less, and my face feels great every single time. The skin is soft, it does not damage it, and leaves it feeling smooth and rejuvenated. For the price - it's a great buy, I have seen brushes 4-5 times more expensive and looks like they are doing the exact same job. I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend to a friend (actually, I did, to several). I use this daily and even from the first time I used it I could see my skin clearing up! I use it in the shower, or in the sink, both work fine.  It is easy to clean and has many different options from sensitive skin, to exfoliating brush, to a body brush, and a pumice stone even. Purchased two for mother and daughter.  They both love the product and are quite happy.  The price is right and multiple brushes are great.  Time will tell if products lasts, but so far a great buy. Loving this product! It helps keep my forehead from getting ""flakey"" I received this cleansing brush set as a gift one Christmas and I loved it so much that I purchased it for my niece this past Christmas.  It's a really nice cleansing brush set and I've had it for well over a year and I have not had any issues with it.  And, from my everyday use of the set, I have noticed a really nice difference in my skin. I really like this system. It makes my skin feel so much smoother. It's nice to have a large exfoliating brush for the shower and the pedicure brush.The only suggestion I would have is that there be 2 speeds on the brushes. You can compensate some for this by the pressure you use when applying the brush. I've been using for about 2 weeks now and my face skin feels great, it really clean the face, I only try the sensistive brush beacuse my skin is sensitive. I wasn't expecting a great product for the cost, but is one of my best purchases. It arrive on time, great conditions just like the picture. just a delight to use  as directed do not over use This brush is amazingly good for the price. I was told to get a Clarisonic or a Soniclear to clean my face because cheaper brands don't get the job done. Well, they've never tried this one! It reminds me of the brush you can purchase from VanityPlanet for about $30 with the coupon, original $100, but we all know that's a lie and it's only worth $30 ;). I've notice a big difference in my skin since using it, I've only had it for 2 days! My skin is clean, clear and under control >;). Even the dark spot on my face are disappearing. I would recommend this product to anyone suffering from acne and dark spots, but you also have to have a good facial cleaning product to go with it :). Happy Cleaning and Clearing everyone! I LOVE this unit, especially the big brush, which is great for using all over the body.  And with four batteries, it delivers enough power to get a good scrup (unlike the others I've tried).  It also comes with a super soft brush for the face and a pumice attachment to help with the callouses.I highly and wholeheartedly recommend this product. Works well and not as expensive as the other brands. I love this product the brushes feel amazing.It works perfectly and shipping was very fast. It's worth so much more than what it cost, I would definitely recommend this to any and everyone. I have very sensitive skin and these brushes feel amazing on my skin I've been using it everyday since I got it. Just received it and it works fantastic.  Had an accident on my bike and have scar tissue on my eyebrow.  The constant rotation has broke up a major portion of scar tissue and is improving.  I love this face & body brush! Great face/body/foot polishing kit I know there are tons of these brushes out on the market. I can't tell you how this one compares to others, but I can tell you that this one is a great product!! I use it on my face, body, and yes my feet!! It truly works great!! I would definitely purchase this again!! Great product!! Great seller!! Product was delivered on-time and in excellent shape.  This is a great product and I bought two.  One for me and one for my Mom.  She thinks it is great and was amazed at the price compared to what some other brands cost for a similar product.  Please keep up the good work and look forward to getting replacement supplies soon. I have quite a few skin issues because diabetes but this product has softened and brightened not only my complexion but my arms and legs too! Thank you so much for a terrific product. Love this product, it comes with many attachment options, I've used the body one much more than I expected just because it leaves me feeling extra clean! Company takes great pride in their product too, will be using this over and over again, can't beat the price either Fast delivery. I love this product. My face feels extra clean and soft. I have only used the face brush at this point which was my intent. I will get around to using the other attachments. I'm going to get another set for my fiancé. So far - I love it... I have tried the body brush and sensitive skin brush - I love the way they feel and the way they leave my skin feeling. I actually bought it for my teenage son - hoping he will give it a try on his somewhat acne-prone face. When he does, I will update my feedback. So far I love it..Works great..I didn't think I would use the body brush but I use it more than the facial brush. Very nice power and brushes.  Just started using so...results TBD, but I love the way it feels and it sure seems to be cleaning my face well.  Still have my little bumps but more time will tell. I love this spin brush! I've only had it for about a month and I have noticed a huge difference.  I had small bumps on my upper arms and those have all about disappeared. Perfectly packaged.  I am so happy with this purchase. Be careful not to use this too often in a week on your face, especially if you have sensitive skin. Make sure you moisturize within 30 minutes of exfoliating. My niece has seen considerable improvement with this facial cleansing system. She's thrilled! Excellent product I bought this set a few months ago.  I wanted to us it long enough to be able to give a accurate review.  I love this brush set and I'm so happy I bought it.  The price is set is very affordable.  You won't be disappointed that you didn't spend in the upper hundreds for it.  The quality is amazing.  I love the design and the handy box it came in.  Don't second guess yourself,  just buy one. an inexpensive and effective aid for skin care The seller is very proactive and sent me an email when I ordered this system with some tips on how to use and how to register for the warranty. So far, I'm loving this system and I use it at least 4 times a week! Exfoliates the skin nicely.  I have dry skin and this helps lose the flakiness on my face.  I use it over my beard and it's great. Made my skin feel so much better after the first try.  So happy I bought this! I was sent a defective product but after contacting Essential Skin Solutions they were able to send a replacement right away! Fantastic customer service. I’ve only used the product twice and already my skin looks and feels smoother. The oils I use after washing my face soak right into my skin now. I couldn’t be happier! Time to toss the washcloth! Great product with good information on use Very satisfied, would recommend to others. The seller contacted me as soon as I received the product and gave me information on how to use the brushes and I was very pleased with the extra information they gave. I love using the brushes it has made a huge difference in my face and I would definitely buy this again and recommend it! I was skeptical about a face washing brush at first because I have sensitive skin and I thought it might irritate my skin. It didn't at all! I'm happy to report this product lives up to expectations and my skin is clearer pores are clearer and my face feels extra clean every use. Good product. I've been using the brush for sensitive skin everyday for about 3weeks now and the exfoliating brush about once a week and I have to say, it's working better than I expected.  I have a lot of dark acne scars and while this product doesn't promise to make them disappear, my skin does look healthier than it has in years.  My face just feels cleaner and my skin is definitely softer.  I use this along with Murad products that I've been using for a bit longer and I am happy with my purchase. Learing what works best for me but it is a good product. This product is great! It keeps my skin smooth and clear. I have not had any issues keeping it in the shower. I have had people ask how I keep my skin looking so good and this is definitely one of my go to products. A bit bigger and heavier then my last one, and the on/off button seemed backwards, but I use it daily and it works great. This product is great. Just don't over exfoliate. Sometimes I just use the sensitive one more often, and the regular one less frequently. The body one is great too. Mainly if you feel extra yucky and need to exfoliate. softest my face has felt in idk how long. used the big one in the shower and same thing.. softer than any regular exfoliant - def worth the purchase I never used this product or similar ones available in the market before. So, I am not the best person to compare this product with its counterparts. However, this product had instant effects on my acnes, especially on my shoulder and upper back, and arms. It hasn't changed my facial skin a lot yet! Thanks to my mom for recommending this product to me. Inexpensive, works great and even my kids like to use it. I like that it had the additional pumice stone for your feet. I already bought one for someone else as a gift. So far so good, it works as expected"
B019J03616," Leaves my face really soft. I love it light spray with no scents LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! It’s great - refreshing - love I can just spritz it on ! Wow like a fresh shower. Wasn't quite sure why my other products were working so well then decided it had to be the toner. I will not be without it again. I have sensitive skin so this toner worked well. Leaves my skin feeling refreshed and my skin seems more clear and less irritated. This spray feels good on my skin and definitely extends my product life, I use less gel/lotion when I spray first. This is the best toner I have ever used.  It's not drying but seems to be helping reduce the size of my pores. I found this product by chance and boy am I happy I did. I have seen a  significant change for the good in my  complexion. It has dried up most of my blemishes, reduced my pores and fine wrinkles have disappeared. I just turned 60, so yes, I really love this product. As well as the Yeoth cleanser, toner and moisturizer. Really good product for a nice price. Great products as I use it with two of their other products in the morning & at night. I feel my make up goes on much smoother using this toner first.  I love it Feels great on my face! Love!! Really incredible, I have notices my pores tightening, love this product Love this brand.  Have tried each item as it has been introduced.  The toner is light and refreshing and helps the other products spread evenly. love it love this I like this toner alot.  makes my face feel refreshed. Not sure if it has any benefit on its own,  but it prepares my skin nicely for the 3 in 1 hyaluronic serum that I use daily-obsessed. Refreshing I like this product. Great stuff. Anything from Yeouth is great. Skin looks great and a lot of people told me so. I have used this product before was happy with it then & happy with it now I am very pleased with the toner, I have purchased the three items together and I definitely see a difference in my complexion. I will continue to purchase these products. Loved it, I bought a second bottle before I finished using the first one. Highly recommend. I really love this product and the other Yeouth products Love this product.  I think I can skip a face lift for a couple of years.  Unbelievable.  Comments: You are glowing.  thank you I love this product and would repurchase it the smell is good and was receive timely Good product. Love the spray!! It really helps relieve tired, stressed and dehydrated skin Works nice with the serum. Amazing!  Been using about a month and definitely seeing results. A+! My wife loves this toner. Effective toner, especially when used with the serum. Happy with the product. Love it! good Excellent It truly works! I have tried so many products of this type in every price range imaginable but never got any noticeable results until now! I was my face with dove, dry,  follow with this and their retinol serum. I let it dry and lightly apply moisturizer. I got results the first day! Each day is better! I am 56 years old and am looking forward to looking 30 again! Finally, something that works! I suggest you get it before others learn about it and the price goes up! Love it! Noticible difference after using it 2x a day for 3 weeks! Love it. I use it on the hands as well and the darks spots are faded. I love this toner!  I have super sensitive acne prone skin and this toner provides the right PH balance (no matter where I'm traveling and what water I use to wash with), increases hydration and is super easy and quick to use.  I use this as part of a skin care routine, which also includes their Pure Hyaluronic Acid, and my skin has cleared up dramatically.  I only wish I had found these products sooner.  I'm on my second bottle and will definitely continue to purchase and use their products in the future! I so love this product.. I hope they make natural facial cleanser as well..  I am becoming a fan of this product .. I love the toner! I wrote my review on the men's by mistake. Can you cut & paste in the right section? Sorry! My first Yeouth product purchase was the Pure Hyaluronic Acid.  I loved it!  The directions said you are supposed to use this face toner first.  I bought two bottles of the toner and two more bottles of Hyaluronic Acids.  My third order was their Radiance Eye Gel.  I can't tell if I get much benefit from the toner by itself, because I use all three products at the same time.  I spray the toner first, then the facial acid, and next the eye gel.  The direction say use twice daily, but when convenient I do it three times a day just because I like it. The spray is very refreshing and none of the products are irritating. I am 80 yrs young: I do mean young looking, vibrant and energetic..The wrinkles were beginning to show and get deeper. I started this product ans=d a regiment of twice a day cleansing and then using these two products as directed, WALA!  Softer skin, clearer skin, more youthful skin wrinkles softened and diminishing....Everyone cant believe how great I look, and ask, What have you done? Consistently using the product is the key. I'm using this in conjunction with other serums by Yeouth as is recommended. Prior to purchasing this I was just using water to wet my face before to using the serum. Now I mist my face with 4-5 sprits and immediately follow it with my am or pm serum. I don't think that this has had a noticeable difference in my skin but I've only been using it for a few weeks. It has a light pleasant scent that dissipates once it has absorbed. The spray pump disperses a very fine and even mist. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I haven't really seen any improvement since adding this to my routine.I'm now updating my review to 5 stars from 4. I stopped using this because I broke the bottle of serum and I can see my face has been getting blochy and red. I started to mist my face without the serum and it seemed to soothe and even out my skin. After using the 30% glycolic acid gel peel, the toner helps control my oily skin and is very gentle.  I highly recommend Yeouth skincare products. I bought this with the glycolic peel from YEOUTH to help relieve any residual stinging, but I find myself using it on a daily basis. It's got a light, fresh, cooling effect that doesn't disappear as soon as it dries. It's great after both the glycolic and salicyclic peels and after a hot day in the sun. It also works well to ""set"" powder or mineral powder foundation to alleviate that cakey look they can both get. All in all, I think it's worth the purchase price, but I do wonder if buying the limited ingredients seperately would save even more money? My husband and I have both been user the facial toner, as well as other Yeouth products, regularly for about a year. The difference in our skin is amazing  - very effective and not drying at all. We are both not great at skin care routines, have sensitive skin and it is very easy and super affordable to use Yeouth. Most importantly, it works. Love the toners and serums I purchased. I have noticed a difference in the brightness of myFace.  I have been using this along with the micro needling tool I also purchased  at Amazon.Very happy with the results will purchase again The toner is quite refreshing after showering and softens/preps the skin for moisturizer.  Worth having, don't need much to coat the face and neck.  A bottle will last a long time. I love this product!  I think it is the perfect compliment to my face care.  I use it with the Hylauronic Plus from Yeouth and I also spray it on to refresh my skin and make up during the day.  It is so soft and gentle...just love it! I've using Yeouth products for a while now and have to say that even though I will stray a bit and try something else I keep coming back to Yeouth. My skin always looks good, it helps with fine lines and the most important for me is that I do not break out from it. I really like this product, and have ordered it more than once. I use the line of Yeouth products as part of my daily regimen. Perfect misting.  All over face coverage with just a few pumps. Feels more like water. Doesn't leave my face dry, though I do I use the YEOUTH serum directly after so there is a nice blend with the 2 combined. I love this toner so much. It really balanced out my face and it feels light. It lasted exactly 3 months There are no ingredients listed on the bottle, but I like the effect  when I use it in the morning before applying a cream, lotion or foundation. The skin feels very soft and clear. I use it on the neck and chest as well. A little pricey but I think it's worth it. So nice to be able to spray a mist of toner on my face, instead of using cotton balls or cosmetic squares to apply.  Love this product!  Highly recommend!! A great refreshing spray. I use it in the morning and evening. There aren't dramatic results, but definitely helps even my skin tone. Im in my 70s and have tried many creams & lotions. None has made the years fade as Youeth has done. Thank you so much for this wonderful product. I have used Youeth for two years now. I would never go back to any thing else. After buying the complete set of theirs products, the toner was one of my favorite and order separately now  and use all the time. Great for  men to use several times a day if needed . Started using Yeouth products a few months ago.  I am completely sold on all of their products.  Professional grade but affordably priced.  Can't say enough good things about this company. good Very nice product Helps with the other product to make your face feel tighter. Especially around your eyes. This helps activate the serum ❤️"
B00DESHB5M," So far so good. I love it My face started to clear up IMMEDIATELY after using this This is the perfect companion for the facial scrub! It started working the 1st day I used it & people ask me if I'm wearing foundation my skin is so smooth & clear. I will be a repeat customer! Has greatly improved the appearance of my skin. I use it daily and I’m very impressed and pleased with this product. My skin feels so smooth after using this. I've had a problem with dry skin on my face after washing it and this cleared that problem. I use it two times a week and works perfectly. Good service; just what she wanted! Love this! Loveeeee it I love this stuff! I have really really sensitive skin and it doesn’t make me break out at all and leave my skin really smooth. My daughters love this. Love this stuff! My teenaged daughter and I both tried it in the packet form just for the heck of it and found that it helped clear up acne within days. Had to order the jar after that. It doesn't solve face problems completely but it helps a LOT (couple with staying hydrated i.e. drinking lots of water daily and you'll really see a difference in your skin). The tea tree oil is key. Feels great washing off with a nice clean scent (though not overpowering). We now use other facial and hair products in this line and love them all. Also pretty reasonably priced. this stuff is amazing! Great product!! It's a very good product . I have sensitive but very oily skin and it doesn't make my skin peel like some other products did because they're to drying . Within 2 weeks i could see dark spots fading and skin texture softening . But to get the best results use it on a regimine of every 5 to 7 days alone first then with other products to see how they act together . PERFECT FOR BLACK SKIN !! 💖💖💖 I used this product twice, once a week, and realy loved the overall result.Recommend, and buy again. Great stuff. Feels wonderful and helps me control my acne! I don't like peel off masks, or those that when you do take them off, leave your skin feeling dryer than it did when you first put it on.  This mask is exceptional.  Although my skin seems to be closer toward the dry side, it works for me.  I believe it's just for all skin types, and even helps to reduce break outs.  Just love it.  I use it once weekly so it lasts a good long time. Skin feels silky and soft. I love it! The best face mask. Every time I use it I am amazed at how my skin feels. Really helps with break outs and getting the gunk out of your pores. Leaves my skin so soft. This stuff is amazing, I have very oily skin which makes me break out.  It has decreased some of the oil when I use it twice a week and my acne has decreased. Love the smell, super nice and makes youre skin super soft Product worked great, all my blemishes are less visible Love the product, worked well love it I'm one of those people who is always searching for the perfect mask. As a result, I have countless almost-full jars of product that I've tried once and then shoved under the bathroom sink. However, I recently stumbled on this mask, and I can honestly say that this is the only one that I've ever used an entire container of. I love it. I even ordered it for my friends and family. I leave it on a little longer than recommended (15-20 minutes) and afterwards my skin feels soft and hydrated, and within about 10 minutes of removing it I'm redness free. Couldn't recommend this enough. I want to say I've used this mask twice. For me,  I had no reactions, no irritated skin after, non of that.  The mask feels quite powerful while it is on but it is not uncomfortable  (I like to feel something is working). Given the ingredients the tea tree oil is what might give it that powerful feel. It is best to avoid putting the mask too close to your eyes, it will make them watery. After the mask has been applied and i leave it for 10mins, once i wash it off; my skin does feel soft and cleansed. I've noticed I haven't broke out after the two times I've applied this mask in the same week so that is a good sign. I'm going to continue using it and see how well it will continue to work and if it will reduces some of my previous breakouts marks. Just arrived! Used it once so far and am happy with it. We will see as time goes on. I have horrible skin. Ruined by years of consuming copious amounts of red wine. And white wine. And rosé. This mask is helping eliminate my alcohol abuse. Cleanses out my tired, clogged pores like magic. Do I wear the mask while drinking my wine? Yes. Is that counter productive? Potentially. But I see a difference, imagine what it could do for someone's skin that isn't destroyed by alcohol!! I love this mud mask!  I have very stubborn, uneven toned skin and after using this for about 1-2 weeks, my skin is super smooth and it looks it too!  This is probably tmi,  but I started breaking out on my chest and I started applying this mask and it worked!  My skin is a lot more even than it was before I started using this mud mask.  I highly recommend it to everyone! Awesome mask!I have oily, acneic skin and my skin feels awesome after using this! My pores are smaller for sure. I will definitely be buying more.I am also an esthetician and will be using this on my clients who suffer from acne. This mask is the love of my life, let's be real guys. It's perfect and it leaves your skin super smooth and soft. I've honesty only used this product twice (just purchased) and I already love how its makes my skin look and feel. I have oily irrigated skin depending on the temperature outside and I've tried several different soaps & creams that did nothing but made my problem worst or nothing at all  but this seems to be getting the job done I plan to purchase the larger size jar. So, I didn't buy this on Amazon.. But it worked so well I felt the need to write a review.I bought mine at a local Walgreens store, and I am so glad I did!I have combination/oily skin, and recently I've ran into a terrible mess of acne, that has left me with acne scars.I applied this mask last night, yes.. I've only used it once. I woke up this morning with almost clear skin!The first thing I noticed was how much more supple my skin looks, (I'm 25) and just overall brightness. I dare say that even with just one application my acne scars are less noticeable.The pimples that I did have reduced in size and shrunken by at least 80% overall.IM IN LOVE!I've tried everything from Proactive, Cetiphil, Spot treatment, microdermabrasion.. You name it. My next stop was going to be the dermatologist to get a prescription.I'm going to keep using these products and see what happens. Maybe try the Black soap bar.I don't write reviews usually.. But wow. Love this stuff! My skin has been going through a rough patch lately (no pun intended) so I was looking for a gentle but effective mask for my acne and dry spots. I bought a packet portion of this and ended up buying the tub before even finishing the packet.  It smells very nice and leaves my face feeling very refreshed. For people with sensitive skin, the tea tree oil may irritate their skin, however, my skin can tolerate it so i add a couple drops of my own tea tree oil before applying to my face. I haven't been using it long enough to say if it is effective for acne but it definitely feels very nice and smells great. Has great acne fighting ingredients and doesn't dry out the skin. Hope it works!! Really works for me have been mixing this with the yes to tomato brand acne mud mask and my face is finally clearing up . amazing product! my acne has cleared up signifigantly after weekley use, would reccomend to a friend! I recommend this for anyone with troubled naturally oily skin, I started using this product in the middle of a pretty intense breakout and continued to use it every other night and within a month my skin is the clearest it has been  since I was on prescription. It doesn't overdry or irritate, and smells great. I have been using this product only for a week and already have my pores clearing up. It helps my acne scars and new pimples to decrease small and fade away very quickly. My face is always oily and would help it stay smooth and shine all day. I use this at least two times a day and it have not had a single skin allergic to my face. Shit works...yea it stains your face clothes but it's a BLACK mask so that's a given if your not a moron....but nothing a good wash won't fix...it's a great product for not very much considering how expensive s*** masks can get...doesn't dry ur skin n it evens out the tone of your skin...bottom line it works I've been struggling with tiny bumps on my forehead for a long time and nothing was treating it. After one use, this made DRASTIC difference. I wish I had before and after shots but I'm in love with this mask! Exactly what I expected! Leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshed! Only need a small amount to cover your whole face so it should last a while! (: I really like this mask. It does smell exactly like pay-dough but it works well and it isn't irritating in any way. I loved this product. It reduces blemishes with continued use. Makes my skin really soft. I like the texture and the smell. Would recommend"
B00S9QP9NA, Love this product love love love that all i can say Excellent Everything was great on time and of best quality!! Love this stuff!  Easy way to clean your face. Excellent product
B06WP1WF3P," Amazing results. I use it every single day while in the shower. I'm a dude and I never used to take care of my face. I guess because I am turning 30 this year and it's time to start to take better care of myself. While it is a bit pricey. This thing won't disappoint you. My face feels clean all the time. This is the real thing. Not like the other one I bought which just looks like it's from Japan, this one actually doesn't disintegrate and lasts"
B00C7Q6HPM," Works great.  Good scent, leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed. A great budget - friendly facial moisturizer with good ingredients. Leaves my skin hydrated but not greasy. This moisturizer is so gentle and leaves my face feeling just lightly moisturized in my dry climate.  It soaks in fast so that I don't have to wait too long to put on my make up on the morning, and doesn't leave an oily feeling behind.  A great choice for an affordable all natural product! Got this for my teenagers for a light moistuizer for the winter months.  We love Everyone products!  I found myself using it on my face and hands. Great lotion. Purchased for my husband & he likes it & uses it. Works great on body. Amazing scent Nice mild face wash. Light scent. Great year round and for use on sensitive/combination skin. One of the best cleansers I've ever used. Smooth Nice scent, refreshing to the skin, and refines pores. This is the only place aside from Whole Foods that I can find it. Great everyday, all season moisturizer for my combination acne prone skin. Very nice moisturizer. Will keep buying it. Absolutely love this.  It is gentle but works really well.  Wonderful scent.  It literally has made my skin look much younger.  I use it religiously every morning. Love this lotion. Smells great and has a very light feel to it. Doesn't feel to grease after using it and it doesn't feel like its even on your skin. I love this moisturizer and have even got my mother using it :) its a great price, goes on smooth and soaks in quickly. I have combination skin of dry but oily that is also prone to breaking out. This face wash has helped me skin become more toned. I've also noticed smaller breakouts and I've only been using it for about a week. It also has a very nice smell to it. This product is so much better than those harsh chemicals I used to put on my face. There's no going back for me. My favorite facial cleanser. I have normal to oily skin and this wash helps keep my skin glowy without overdrying. Love this face scrub. Cruelty free. best face cleaner without all the chemicals Not greasy and doesn't clog pores. I also love that it's natural. This is just wonderful. Goes on like silk and gets off all my makeup. So much better than soap!! I will purchase again for sure! Excellent product... I love it.. Cleanse really well and thoroughly ... I purchased this face wash for my husband originally. He has roseacea. It worked to calm his skin down so I tried it. Now we both use it. Good ingredients and  gentle. Amazon always has good prices. This is a really nice basic moisturizer - I like using it everyday and I use the Face scrub once a week.  The Face moisturizer lasts a loooong time because you just use a tiny bit each time. Love it! Another great product from this brand.Like i stated in my last review for the lotion this products quality exceeds the price point... i suppose.Or the other ""man"" brands are just too damn pricey for what they provide.I currently haveUrsa Major, Clinique for Men charcoal, malin-goetz, and Kiehls facial fuel.Out of those Kiels is my favorite but $22 for 2.5 oz is not ideal.8oz of this stuff for this price is amazing and it gently cleans my face with zero dryness.  I may have hit the lottery here but ill stick with this product as it works for me very well compared to the other very expensive in comparison products. Great scent. Skin feels soft and smooth after using. Love these wipes for my sensitive skin. However, there is left over makeup after using one wipe. Exfoliation without plastic beads, yes please!!!! Smells great too! Works great for normal skin. Very clean with non residue. I like these! Great for removing makeup and washing face at night. love this moisturizer for face and neck...keeps all lovely and luscious! These are the best makeup removing wipes I've ever used. It takes the heaviest makeup off without leaving your eyes and face greasy or oily like other wipes do. I've been using this product for a couple weeks now and its working just fine.  The consistency is a bit on the watery side but I don't mind. Been using this for months. Great stuff if you chemical peel or microdermabrasion. When this arrived I thought that I'd been mistakenly sent body lotion because of the bottle size and type of dispenser, but the product is definitely just for faces.  I'm using it during a hot northeastern summer and it provides enough moisture without making me shiny.  Great value for the money and I love that it doesn't have sulfates or alcohol on the ingredients list. Bought this for myself but found I needed something lighter, more like a gel. So I gave it to my (bald) husband.  He loves it!  He used it on his entire face and head and says nothing he's used previously did the job as well - and he's tried many things including straight up coconut oil.  For whatever reason, THIS formula is perfection for him.  So, because it was an ""add on"" item, I bought several to stock up with while still getting free shipping.  Everything I've tried from this brand is of high quality. great all around Love this gluten free product! Great and clean toner. Will purchase again. I use it as my aftershave. So happy with it. High quality fantastic product.  Smells and feels amazing on my extremely sensitive skin! Soft and luxurious.  My face loves it.  Gentle and a pleasant scent. Great product,  good company! I have tried many different makeup wipes after trying to keep things as natural as possible. Either they aren't as natural as they claim, or they irritate my sensitive/dry skin. These work perfectly for me, remove makeup/eye makeup prior to cleansing with a gentle cleanser (John Masters Linden Blossom) and my clarisonic at night.Some may have trouble with waterproof or more stubborn eye makeup. Since I've switched to natural cosmetics, all of my eye makeup comes off very easily with these (liquid eyeliner from Jane Iredale and Tarte mascara).I didn't like different Burts Bees varieties, or any of the Yes To brand that I tried. I'm sticking with these!Also check out EO brand hand sanitizer, body wash, and body lotion (love the lemon scent). Everyone Face Exfoliate, 8 Ouncethis is very nice. I like it and feels good on my face. Thank you This face wash is wonderful! It works great and feels so good! It smells good too! I am happy with my buy! Thanks! This is a really great cleanser. Makes my skin feel smooth and clean Cleanses well, gentle on my skin. great product! works awesome. Its nice smelling, gentle, effective, and cruelty free. Love it. Wife loves them! This is the best face was product I have found This is the best cleanser I have ever had. I was literally scrubbing my eye make up off with MAC wipes and then using another cleanser to try and get the make up off. I no longer need to use the eye make up wipes. I use this and it takes off every drop of make up and my towel is clean when I wipe my face. It's awesome and not drying. I'm in my 50's and its great for me. This stuff is great. I use only this to wash my face. once a day every day. My complexion is better, no more super red dry spots. I'll be back if it doesn't do what I expect from EO products but suffice it to say I do expect clean pores without stripping the moisture from my collagen defective skin. I have a disorder of the connective tissues that causes most cleansers to raise, I dunno, white blood cells, collagen, sebum bumps(?), that just beg me to run my nails across and pop (ewe, I know), causing scabs, around my nose and above/around my top lip. AHA, BHA both do this. Selma Hayek products do not do this but they're more expensive and only ""halfish"" natural so I thought I'd give EO a try. Love their Citrus/Mint EO soap, but didn't use for face and it's specific to bubble bath, shampoo, body wash, (never used for my fragile hair-collagen problem there too). Never caused build up or itching like almost EVERY other soap. Wish me luck? I'll amend to 5 stars if it's as I expect.... Love this face soap I love it. I'll admit - I'm not 100% crazy about the smell of this product. It's a lemon scent with a hint of something that I can't put my finger on. Despite the scent, I still really love this product. I was using Simple Face Cleanser and having a ton of problems with breakouts. Since using this cleanser for the last couple of weeks, my skin is on the mend! I've used a few different brands of makeup remover towelettes and these are by far the best. I don't wear a lot of makeup but they certainly take off my daily makeup (mascara & tinted moisturizer). They don't sting or irritate my eyes like the other brands. They smell nice and the best thing is they are not tested on animals. Definitely the only makeup remover towelettes I'll be using from now on. I LOVE this moisturizer.  My skin is so sensitive and I have a reaction to so many things, but my skin loves this. It has a natural herbal smell. Clean and fresh. The ingredient list is fantastic, including argon oil. I have very sensitive, oily skin, and this cleanser is great.  It keeps blackheads and whiteheads away but is not drying.  It doesn't cause irritation and has a pleasant smell.  I hope it is never discontinued! I'm trying to only buy products that do not test on animals but are still useful to my life. I've had this cleanser for a month now and I love it. The pump makes it easy to dispense and it smells great. My skin feels clean and refreshed but not super dry after I use it. I'm obsessed with this toner! It makes my face feel so refreshed throughout the day. Very light and gentle on the skin, I use it every day and I love it.  It does not leave your face shiny, which is a big plus for me.  I love EO products :) I used it last year and wanted it again.It feels good on the skin and has a pleasant smell.It's a good value because it last very long,without going bad. Gluten free so not worried for this celiac. My partner really likes the way it smells, too. LOVE LOVE LOVE!I have never gone back to another moisturizer or body cream. Even my husband really likes it and he usually could care less.It soaks in to your skin and feels wonderful. Many creams leave my skin feeling suffocated. Feels like a layer of plastic over my skin keeping it from breathing. This brand is WONDERFUL. I have purchased many of their products now! LOVE IT!!! I read most of the reviews and saw that it was a natural approach to facial care.  I am in my 30s and still break out and have sensitive skin.  I am a red head.  I have tried everything. Noxema, Oil of Olay, Proactiv, Clinique you name it.  This lotion is working out very well.  A few people wrote about how aweful it smells.  Seriously, it's not bad and doesn't even linger.  For all natural, that's what you deal with and the best way I can describe is that ""Noxema"" scent.  I have not had any weird blemishes or sores since I started using this which is usually a sign that it is not agreeing with my skin.  The price is great and it's not one of those dinky little one ounce bottles for $25 that you would find elsewhere.  Very happy with it take my word for it.  I have suffered enough for you to believe! I've used lots of high end moisturizers in the past but always felt like I was paying for the brand and thought that I must be able to find a more affordable facial moisturizer that had quality ingredients at a lower cost. I also didn't want to just go with a drugstore brand with lots of preservatives or harsh chemical ingredients. The ingredient list has mostly natural fruit oils and butters. I did my research and came across EO and Everyone brand. The first time I used it, I massaged a tiny bit on my face until it was totally absorbed and I woke the next morning with soft and hydrated skin. I do suffer from hormonal chin and mouth-area white heads from time to time and I swear in the last two weeks, they have been so much less than usual with this moisturizer being the only change to my routine. Also, the second time I used it, I put too much on my face and it just sat on top and hardened a bit instead of just being absorbed so it's crucial to use enough to cover your face (I suggest massaging into the skin until absorbed) but not an excess amount. Since I use this at night, I actually find the herbal scent calming which helps me to fall asleep. i have pretty dry skin on my face and this makes it very soft without clogging my pores. my FAVORITE thing about this moisturizer is how quickly it sinks into my skin and dries down even in the humid florida weather. it is a HUGE bottle for the price and i have been using it twice daily for over a month now and i will definitely repurchase when i get low. this wears wonderfully under makeup. the only thing i can imagine someone not loving is the scent but i dont mind. it smells very natural. reminds me of seventh generation cleaning products a little bit (lol). but for the price and amount of product you get i 10/10 would recommend. After years of buying expensive Pevonia Botanicals face care products, I wanted to go with more natural products. Tried this 3 years ago and love it. My skin is sensitive and this product is perfect and has made my skin look and feel better. Excellent No-Frills Cleanser.I have extremely oily skin and also wear a lot of makeup. Thoroughly rids my face of all dirt and grime without stripping or drying it. Super effective and gentle and a little goes a long way. Leaves no residue and works very well with other facial products. A fantastic PERMANENT addition to my skincare regimen! I love Everyone products! The facial cleansers have been good for my skin and my husband's. It is usually a struggle to take my mascara off. Scrubbing my eye with soapy water doesn't work, nor does scrubbing it with a makeup remover pad which stings my eyes, or coconut oil which also gets in my eyes. I just used this stuff and it took off all my makeup, mascara and all, with a gentle wash using one pump of soap. I use EO lotion, body wash, and hand sanitizer. I have psoriasis, and get hives or dermatitis if my super sensitive skin doesn't like something. My skin loves all the EO stuff I've used, and I was massively relieved to see the face wash was no different. It also didn't sting, and washed off easily. My face didn't feel dry or tight, either, which was nice. I have been using this in the evening to wash off my make-up, and it's working really well! My skin feels clean and soft, with no oily residue. My skin is kind of sensitive, but I haven't found this to be irritating. I follow up with a moisturizer, but it doesn't feel overly drying, either. It smells refreshing, kind of citrusy. Great purchase! I actually bought this personally from the Whole Foods store. It was only $5.99, and I also got the moisturizer.The exfoliater smells really nice and refreshing..nothing too strong.Love the moisturizer as well.I recommend this to women who need to clean their skin. Also as a young makeup artist trying to stay organic and chemical free I really enjoy this product.I come from a very unhealthy past and luckily my face has always remained clear. But I learned that true health comes from the inside out..not the amount of foundation you apply. Take care of your body, and the biggest organ on your body. Your skin. Tried this because I love the other EO lotions.  I've replaced my night moisturizer with this product.  My skin thanks me:) Great toner! Feels refreshing and smells fruity. Actually, the scent reminds me of Fruity Pebbles. Doesn't dry out my skin and smells light and fresh. Very gentle even my daughter uses it. Face feels very clean after using.  Like the natural ingredients.  Pleasant fragrance. Love this stuff- leaves skin smooth and bright but it is very mild. Removes make up too. i have ""mature"" Italian skin and this product cleans deep, exfoliates, tightens pores but doesn't strip natural oils. Great price , a bottle lasts quite a while and it is easy to dispense with the pump bottle. i keep it in the shower. Non-abrasive, gentle on skin, and gets skin super clean. Love Everyone products! We've been using this face wash for months. It's absolutely fantastic! I love that it's not tested on animals and is filled with national ingredients and smells and feels fantastic. I'm a big fan. I have looked for years for a natural moisturizer (or any one, for that matter) that doesn't irritate my sensitive skin, doesn't make my face greasy or oily, and doesn't contain anything I'm allergic to (fragrance, certain preservatives, and lots of other things). I have oily skin, but now that I'm not a kid anymore,I need a moisturizer in the fall and winter. This moisturizer is really great!You don't need much though! I use about a pea size amount for my whole face, and it sinks right in and does its job without making my face feel greasy. I pump a little onto my fingers, swirl it between my fingertips, smear it all over my face, and then massage it in. This way I use just a little and it doesn't get greasy. I tend to not need moisturizer in the summers since it's so humid where I live, so I usually don't use it all summer, but now that fall weather is hitting, I was glad to have this on hand. I use it with the Cerave Foaming cleanser and I rarely get a breakout and my afternoon oiliness is better than with any other product combo. Also, it gives me no trouble when I bother putting makeup on over it. Awesome product without all the harmful chemicals. Works great! It's light and refreshing. I used it every day right after I shower. It keeps my skin hydrated and glowing! This is a GREAT product! lightly exfoliates leaving my skin smooth and refreshed. I trust the ingredients and this company to provide me with the best, and they have never let me down. :) Two thumbs up! I use this lemon face cleaner every day. It has made my skin healthy, soft, and reduced my breakouts. I have sensitive skin and this wash does not irritate me at all. It does not foam which took some getting used to but it leaves your skin feeling very clean. Amazing and all natural I find this is the best thing ever for shaving my legs.  Between the exfoliation and slipperiness of this formula, I get the smoothest results.  While it's kind of expensive using ANY face wash for shaving, you get a pretty decent amount (8 oz) for not much money here, so it's not ridiculous to use it for that purpose. I just bought this product a week ago and am liking it.  I usually like St. Ives green tea wash, but I can't find it!  This is nice and light and leaves face feeling clean and fresh.  I use it in the morning and then apply moisturizer (not EO) and it works great. love it, my fav My skin is oily but usually gets dry in the winter.  My skin is loving this moisturizer.  I use it after cleansing in the morning and night.  It soaks in quickly and doesn't leave any residue.  Since I began using it a month ago my skin hasn't been flaky and dry like it normally is in the colder months. I purchased these to remove my eye makeup that does not seem to come off with soap and water in the shower. One wipe will remove the makeup from both eyes - eyeliner, mascara, eye shadow, and brow liner. The wipe is also thick enough to do the job. I did not notice any residue in my eyes after cleaning off my makeup as with oil based products or lotions. I will continue to use these. Love these products I have all three the wash, astringent and moisturizer I switched completely to the Everyone products Smells like heaven and keeps my sensitive skin clear without the irritation that comes from other scented products. Love it. I love this product. Does not dry or irratate your face. Follow with some Toner and you are ready to go! This face wash is great. It is super gentle and smells amazing. It even does a pretty good job at removing eye makeup. The bottle is bigger than most face cleansers so you get more for your money, too."
B003AVNLP2," Love it! My girlfriend loves them. These are great.  Work well and super convenient especially for travel Keeps skin smooth Love the product, but does tend to dry out before all of the wipes are used up. Works great! I use these cleaning towelettes daily to remove my makeup.  Love that I can buy a package of three so I don't have to order so often. Works amazing. This is my second time ordering the pack of three. I love them for on the go mornings or late at night when I don't feel like washing my face. I think we can all relate at some level to not wanting to wash your face at the end of the day. I personally wear a ton of makeup on my work days, but I'm so tired I don't want to spend 20 minutes washing off all the makeup or using the oily stuff that makes your eyes feel all greasy. These wipes are awesome. I typically have to use 2 of them to actually get off all the makeup and get that fresh feeling. I can say that there is a lack of air tight storage, however I have an easy fix. I just use the old neutrogena case that I had from the more expensive brand. These Olay wipes work great they take off layers of mascara, the glue from false lashes and charcoal eyeliner. I love them and would definitely recommend them to anyone. You can't beat this price. Olay has a nice line of products and this one is my favorite. It makes my face smooth and soft ...I love it. Love the way my face feels after using these. They clean well and leave my face feeling clean and refreshed They are priced way better than in the store.  This is my second time buying them. These are great for those days when I am lazy and don't want to take the time to use my amazing Mia Fit.  They are gentle, have a pleasant scent and leave the skin refreshed and soft. I bought these because I wanted something quick and easy as a face cleaner but not necessarily for every day. That it has exfoliating is a nice bonus. The wipes stayed moist for a long time in the resealable bag.  There's a little perfume to it but not overpowering, and whatever Olay uses for the cleansing is not harsh on skin (nice change from other products I've tried).  I will most definitely be buying these cleansing wipes again. I have tried several make-up remover wipes and these are my favorite. I shower every evening but normal soap and water does not remove my eye make-up well and if I use a wash cloth, they end up getting stained. I remove my make-up with the Olay wipes before I get into the shower and then just use my regular soap and water. I gave a package to my mom and she really liked them and asked me to get her more. She is in bad health and these are easy for her to wash her face. They leave your skin feeling moist and not dry. I have been using these cloths since they came on the market. Cleans & moisturizes like only Olay can. Finding them on Amazon was fabulous, what a tremendous savings! These are great for a quick cleanse to get rid of your face make up.  If I am just too tired to wash my face and go through that whole routine at night, I will use a couple of these to get the make up off my skin. Of course these are not as effective as an actual face washing but it's better than nothing. I really like them for when I am traveling or just in a hurry too. I have not tried to remove my waterproof mascara with these, so I don't know how they work for that. Overall, I would recommend these!  Olay really makes some good stuff. My favorite facial wipe, and I've tried a great deal that are on the market. Nice smell, feel soft, thick enough, no residue, no stinging. Leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean. The trio pack on amazon saves me multiple trips to the store as well as saves me money. My go-to cleansing cloth! These work really well and smell so nice and clean. Great for taking off make up and for a refresher and any time . Nice and cool on your skin. Kinda exfoliates a little also. I have used this product for years. When I'm getting ready for bed at night, I don't want to be splashing water everywhere. This cleansing cloth provides me that luxury. In addition, it doesn't dry out my skin like so many other cleansers. I highly recommend this product. love this Great. I like these wet cleansing cloths a lot and use them daily, both morning and night.  They do well at removing the make-up that I use and leave my face feeling clean and refreshed.  I follow this cleaning with a moisturizer by Olay as well. These cleansing cloths go with me in my travel bag at all times. I like these much better than those wipes, that when wet are soapy, and then requires a couple rinses to remove.  I haven't had any breakouts, or dry skin from using the Olay Regenerist Micro-Exfoliating Wet Cleansing cloths.  These are my favorite of all brands I have used. Wonderful product especially for those of us (and you know who you all are) who are so tired and lazy at the end of the day to wash their face. This product makes that task all the less cumbersome. Removes makeup and dirt effortlessly and leaves skin refresh and moist. Highly recommend. I keep a pack in my purse as well my gym bag. Great product from a name you trust about skin care. Highly recommended to anyone who needs a clean face any time of day.  Removes all make-up and leaves skin smooth and clean with tightened pores. I use these every night. They take makeup off easily and keep my skin clean. Then use plain water in the mornings... I have very few if any wrinkles and just turned 60! ;D I love using the Olay Regenerist Cleansing wipes for my face.  Since I am retired and a stay-at-home grandma, I don't always wear make-up, so I don't use these wipes to clean off make-up.  My purpose to use these is to get a very refreshing cleanse at the end of my shower right before I go to bed.  They make my skin feel soft and smooth. I've been using these face cloths for many years.  They are fast and easy in the evenings when I'm tired and perhaps tempted to just skip nightly cleansing before bed.  They remove makeup easily (even eye makeup).  I've been ordering them from Amazon for at least a year or two.  They are always fresh and moist and less expensive than buying them at my drugstore. Been using for years and will continue to use. A great way to purchase as they are a popular item in the stores. Cleans all make up off easily without pulling or dying. I just received the Olay Regenerist face wipes and used them for the first time. My skin feels amazing. I have tried many other exfoliating face wipes and never has my face felt so clean, firm and smooth. I am pleasantly surprised. I plan on purchasing these wipes again. use these cleansing cloths exclusively for facial care, never let soap touch my face... cleans extremely well without drying and just enough moisture to easily apply serums, creams, treatments daily... cloths are well sealed and never dry out, use AM/PM and have perfect complexion...high recommend for Amazon price, availability, quality I really love the way it makes my skin feel. Love this product. These are perfect for removing makeup before bed. They smell great, and they are very gentle on the skin and don't leave any layers of film on your skin. I have been using these wipes for quite a while.  They are still moist and work perfectly.  They feel good on the skin and take all my makeup off with ease.  They don't really have any sort of strong smell so you don't have to worry about that if you have an aversion to smells.  I highly recommend these and would definitely reorder! Oil of Olay has been around longer than I have. It is much better than I expected. I have spent ridiculous amounts of money on facial serums, creams, dry oils, gels, blah blah blah. With this, I get my money's worth. It feels good going on, and I am impressed with how much softer my skin feels. Awesome smell and love it's work and performance. Will but again and again ... I've used these for many months now and have yet to find any better. I like the Subscribe and Save option - keeps me in stock, yet I can cancel or reschedule if need be (like when I go on vacation!) My skin feels wonderful - and although mine is fairly sensitive, these have not annoyed it at all. for the nights that I go to bed exhausted, and forget to wash my face.... I keep these in my night stand, and instead of getting up, I'll just wash my makeup off in bed. I don't use them daily, but they are SUPER handy for those nights when I am just too dang tired to do my whole nightly ritual... and one wipe cleans off all my eye makeup (eyeliner and mascara) and thoroughly cleans my face. They do what they say. Really like these.  I've never used just soap & water on my skin and never had problems with breakout, blackheads or drying. These are perfect to clean my face. No messy creams; just wipe my face clean and pitch!  Keeps my skin clean, smooth and soft!  Would recommend to anyone who doesn't like to spend a lot of time or mess cleaning their face. These are perfect! Removes makeup without irritation, leaves skin clean without residue Olay is my favorite brand never steers me wrong! love it! I use another brand faithfully but decided to try these since I use so many other Olay products! LOVE THESE! Soft and gentle on face but gets off all the makeup and is wonderful. These may replace my others permanently​!  Great product! Oil of Olay is a name I trust, and go back to again and again. These cleansing cloths are perfect. They make you feel like you had a facial. Gentle, thorough, and all you need to clean your face and remove makeup. The container keeps all the sheets moist and clean too. Closes tight and stays closed. A little hint: you can put a couple in a Ziploc bag in your purse to freshen up any time of day! (: I use the Olay Regeneriest Micro-Exfoliating Wet pads every night to clean the makeup from my face.  I find that they do the trick for me and also moisuturize my face.  Try them, you will like them. I use this product all the time, it is great! I've been using this cleansing cloths for years! They're great! Take off all make up including water proof mascara. Skin feels soft, clean and moisturized after. No water needed. Great for travel and everyday use. Highly recommend! I love Olay products. This one did not let me down. My face feels great. Amazon didn't let me down either. Thank you These are great can convenient. I'll be ordering them again  :) My absolute favorite face wipe. Has a better smell than other wipes ive tried. The price for three was great. Will be back for more Love it I like these cleansing towelettes.  They are large, so I cut them in half to use, which makes them more reasonable. Perfect! Very good! For early morning and late at night! I really like these Olay Regenerist wipes and Amazon is the only source I can find for them.  Thanks! I've used this product for years. Every year I love it more. My skin is super sensitive to soaps and most cleansers so it's nice to have something that cleans, is soothing, pleasant smelling and gentle to my face. Love using these moist towelettes.  Great way to remove dirt and makeup leaving your skin clean and feeling refreshed.  Removes makeup with ease.  I am never without these towelettes. Great time saver when to tired to wash face. I keep a pack in my bedside table. I had several sun dark spots, and this is decreasing the pigment. It also reduces pore size. Been using this procuct for a long time.  You might say I am an OLAY lady lady as I use many of their products. I absolutely love these. I carry a pack with me where ever I go, use them at night to remove make up, before exfoliating. I use them in the morning when I wake up. They seem to help alleviate that morning puffiness and really arouses the skin. I use them after working out and I use them whenever I need a quick refresh. I am an Olay Gal who appreciates the gentleness and thoroughness of these wet cleaning cloths; nary a speck of makeup remains on your skin while they leave you clean and moisturized. Great product! I suffer from Adult onset Acne.  It left horrible scars on my face.  I tried all kinds of stuff.  Then I tried this combination, not only did my acne clear up, but the scars went away, and my face is glowing now.I don't use the facial wipes everyday, but I will pull them out when my face starts feeling ""icky"" during the day.  But I don't wear make up, so I don't have to worry about removing my makeup with them.Daily Cleanser: Olay Total Effects Refreshing Citrus Scrub, 6.5 fl oz (Pack of 3)Exfoliating/Deep Cleaning: Olay Regenerist Advanced Cleaning System Specialty Cleanser X 1 packWhen the sample that comes with the brush system runs out, use this: Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub Cleanser 6.5 Fl OzAnd, of course, don't forget to moisturize! Love these for complete facial cleaning. Convenient for travel and they don't dry my skin. I have been using this for years!!  It's so handy and easy to use... I think it's great! Works very well great product! I have been using Oil of Olay products for as long as i remember. I love their products. 1 single pack of the wet cleansing cloths is $9.00 so it's a bargain for 3. Will definitely buy again. Love these use every day Fixed my problem areas in less than a week. My facial skin hasn't looked this good in a long time. Been using these for years. Love them Love these! These seem to remove most if not ALL of my makeup and they leave my face silky. They are a little more textured than the wipe I was using and I like that because they make my face smoother. I often do not have time to wash my face (either am or pm) and use this instead. Leaves me feeling clean. Definitely recommend. I have tried lots of Olay products and this is one I have repeatedly ordered via Amazon. My husband and I love these facial clothes and use them daily.  They are also so easy to bring along on trips and we pack them with us wherever we go.  They can be hard to find at times, until I realized that Amazon sells them - and at a great price too!  Now I am able to stock up much easier! :) I have used these wet cleansing cloths for a long time and will continue using them.  They are so convenient. These are nice. I love the way they feel. I'll be buying more. I LOVE THESE CLOTHS!  I started using Olay Regenerist products several years ago and feel they keep my face and neck looking young!  People that see me don't believe I'm as old as I am because I don't have wrinkles and my face still looks young! I was afraid these would irritate my sensitive eyes, but they were really great. I wish they were a bit bigger, as I used them to take off makeup, but they worked well enough. While I have only been using this product for about a week, I am pleased with the results.  My skin is feels softer and smooth.  If this keeps up I will really like this product. Okay, I'll admit it...I am lazy when it comes to skin care.  That's why I decided to try these and they are soooo easy!  Just a few wipes across my face, neck and decollette (sp?) and I'm ready for the next step.I've been using these about two weeks and can tell a difference in the look of my skin.  It's smoother and clearer looking.  Looking forward to seeing results multiplied by continued use. A really good way to remove makeup; the cloths leave a pleasant feel without a greasy residue. Works better than other makeup remover wipes I've used, especially to get off mascara. It doesn't get all of my mascara off but still more than others. And it doesn't leave a film on your face. great for my face totally love these Olay wet wipes. I am an Olay die hard fan, and these are totally worth it. It removes all the makeup before I use my Olay face wash, and I have very sensitive skin. Totally recommend these wipes. they work good Great - Thanks! When I am feeling lazy and can't do my normal face washing routine, this is SO easy and I feel better knowing I'm not sleeping in makeup and grime from the day. I use it daily for cleaning and it is great as I use it before 2 other products I use for facial aging and damage. I have been using these cloths for quite sometime, and have found that my pores are smaller and my skin is clearer.  The are excellent for removing makeup or just cleansing the face and neck. works good I'm lazy about face care so keeping a small pack of these close at hand soles the problem of looking for my stuff amid a counter full of everyone's stuff. Gentle. Have seen some reduction of redness after just 2 weeks. Great idea! Another great product from Olay. These clothes are a little smaller than others I tried but they are nice and damp and if used skillfully you can get a whole face of makeup off no problem. Absolutely lovely. I use these every day and have given some to others' to try.  These cloths do not dry out my skin. Good product! I happen to really like Olay products.  These offer a quick solution to remove makeup without oily residue. Love these Use them daily ... Love the convenience. wife uses daily Great product Quality product. I am too tired at night to do a proper face wash, and I find these cloths are a quick and easy way to get the job done thoroughly. I use Olay Regenerist after cleansing and my skin feels great. These are amazing. They leave my skin so soft! I love this product. I am so tired at the end of the day, and these are so easy to use.  They do remove dirt easily too. The cool wipes are refreshing too. Very handy for quick clean ups after a work-out or when you are away from home.  I love them!  Leave my skin clean and soft. Smells great, leaves my skin feeling soft and silky. Removes all of the dirt and makeup with just one cloth I have vey sensitive skin and this product cleans all the dirt from my face wont use anything else. I've been using this product for years and it does a wonderful job of cleaning my skin and removing makeup. I like receiving the product every three months, so I never run out. I love these cloths.  My face feels so clean & refreshed!  It feels like I had a deep cleaning facial! I like using these during the day. I have oily skin and I feel refreshed during the day just wiping my face down. Great for nightly cleaning and removal of makeup. Very good at removing make-up. Leaves a refreshing clean feeling. I have been using this product for several years and I really like it.  It is great for taking off that make up and grime that accumulate on your face during the day. I have been using these cleansing towels for years and was glad to find them at Amazon.  It's the only thing I will clean my face with. my skin feels so good after using these I love these wipe. They are great in between deep cleansing. Travel and just to fresh your face before your moisturizer I use these every night - hydrating and non-irritating.  Makes my skin feel great and does not cause me to break out. I was very pleased with them and the cloths felt so refreshing and my face felt so clean.  I will buy them again as wel as  recommend them. Great Product.  Purchased some other brands (Ponds, Aveno) and this one is my favorite.  Doesn't dry out my skin but cleanses well. Perfect for travel bag, gym bag, and night stand. These are my very favorite face wipes!! They are ao convenient when you're on the go!! these are a great, reasonably priced wet makeup cleansing cloth.  I use them regularly.  The smell is not overwhelming and they are easy to handle. Love these, quick and easy yet still provides all the benefits of good cleansing from trusted brand Olay.  Perfect for traveling too! love these These are amazing. They worked very well without agitating my skin. Does a great job removing makeup, but also moisturizes. Would recommend to all my friends. I will be purchasing more at a later date. Great price  as well. Thanks Good and refreshing substitute for a full wash while traveling. Excellent for airports. Keeps my  skin dewy and fresh between flights. Easy to use and I like to take these camping for easy access and fast cleanup.  Really good product. I have been around the face wipes game quite a lot and I have never experienced the luxurious & moisturizing quality of these face wipes!They make you feel almost pampered while cleaning your face.I will order again & again & again because they are that good! I love these cleansing cloths.  They removed my face make up & eyeliner make up without irritation.  I strongly recommend these wipes. I use these in the morning. They make my face feel fresh. I use this before bedtime instead of any other cleanser.  It makes my face clean and soft without drying it out. Wonderful product. Skin felt clean after using. Will buy again Handy way to keep skin fresh. I didn't think these would be worth it, but some nights it's just the thing for a quick cleaning and moisturizing I really love these face wipes, and go through them pretty quickly. This 3-pack is a great deal - so glad I found it! I've been using Olay products for years. I still use the regular cleanser, but I l love the cloths for removing makeup! Like I love this product.  It removes every bit of makeup and exfoliates my skin perfectly!  I hate being without it! I love these, they are so easy and convenient to use and help with anti-aging. I love olay I LOVE this product!!  I haven't used a cleanser like this before on my face.  I'm getting older and my complexion could use some help so I was looking for something to moisturizer my face when I ran into these cleansing pads.  I gave them a try and now the rest is history as they say.  First, the cleansing pad has a nice feel on the face.  Secondly, the pad cleans your face from makeup and dirt very well.  Thirdly, not only does the pad feel nice and cleanse your face, your face feels fresh and clean afterwards.  Fourth, I'm here to tell you that it works on some of those unexplainable red spots on your face.  I can't tell you how much my face has changed since using this product.  I really do have a smoother complexion and less red spots on my face.  The best part is that you don't have to wait long to see these results.  I saw results after about ten uses.  The more I use them, the better my face looks and feels.  Okay, another reason this product is great, well, look at the price! I love using these morning & evening. My face likes them, too! I have used these for years - it was a great deal! would recommend these to my friends any time. Gentle but thorough. Wipes are a great size. The only face cloth/makeup remover I buy anymore. Effectively takes off makeup and leaves face feeling clean and refreshed. An awesome Olay product. Pticed too high I have used these cleansing wipes for several years. They keep my skin flawless. Excellent for makeup removal. I would recommend them to everyone. CLEANS YOUR FACE  GREAT Love these love how they clean your face. Thanks great product Nice So convenient and wonderful to use! OIL OF OLAY, I HAVE USED IT ALL MY LIFE. GREAT STUFF AND NOT TO EXPENSIVE. ALL OF THE PRODUCTS ARE NICE TO USE. I have used these face wash cloths for at least 2 -3 years.  I obviously like them. I simply used a different means of getting these wipes to my door.  It worked.  So does going to Walgreens.Again you are looking for something that is a lot more of a review than I plan on giving.My review is that I have used these for 3 years. Excellent product. Cancel my order of Oil of Olay face wipes. I already have s supply of them. Love this facial cleaning product. Great experience! Olay's Regenerist Cleansing Cloths are a must have for anyone who has late nights where all you can do is collapse into bed. It thoroughly removes makeup, but can also be used as just a cleanser. It's super convenient to keep in my bedside table, and even if I don't get around to putting on face cream after using these wipes, my skin doesn't feel dry afterwards. Even when I wake up, my face still feels clean and sufficiently moisturized.I also like to bring these with me when I travel to remote places and know that I might not have access to running water. They're great for hiking, camping, or even hiking the Inca Trail to Macchu Picchu! I'm 52; love the skin I'm in, moisturize more often than not...but usually, when I most need to wash up, like after an event/day that 'requires' me to have makeup on, or a hard day weeding, sometimes I have no energy to get the washcloth out and do the right thing for my skin. These Olay cloths are simply a God- send. They clean nicely, keep their moisture well over 30 days, have a barely-there scent, and leave my face feeling fresh. I have to say I am an Olay fan...I've used the products since their first Olay moisturizer way back (what? 25 or so years ago?) These were a natural curiosity for me and my sister swore by them so I tried and agree: worth having around! Just what my ugly front yard cactus needed. I've been in my home for almost 5 years and have always hated the stupid cactus in my front yard. Plenty of length to completely wrap it from about 8' high to the ground and easy to set up. I've had oily skin my whole life and so when I started to develop dry, flaky patches in my early 60's, I had no idea what to do.  I tried all sorts of moisturizers.  Nothing cleared it up completely.  Within three days of using this, I could see them getting better.  Within a week they were almost gone.  On the tenth day (today), they are completely gone.Best of all, my skin hasn't been this soft and smooth in my entire life (oily skin never is).  I also thought I'd try them out on my hands since I do a lot of cleaning and they have gotten rather dry, as well.  After washing my face thoroughly, I use the towelette on my hands before throwing it away.  I am INCREDIBLY pleased with how much better my hands look and feel - they are even less wrinkled than they've been in years!!!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  Especially for aging skin.  THANK YOU, Olay! Cleans to perfection These work really well. No matter what make up I put on, or how much dirt ended up on me (and I took these on a camping-style trip), these cloths were able to take it all off so I could go to bed without anything on my face - which is really important to keep your skin clear and healthy. The packaging even kept the cloths moist out in the heat of the August day during my trip, which was impressive.If you have problems getting your makeup off, these are a great way to do it. I like this PRODUCT a lot.  JUST BEWARE....they only sent me one arrived today.  I called and they are going to make it up to me asap.  This has happened often when buying multi packs so just beware.....the product gets a five.  NO ODOR AT ALL.....think person has different product in mind or received wrong item....surprise surprise....  very slight fragrence not odor as I opened new package to review here after reading other reviews..... These are both refreshing and cooling to the face especially after coming out of a hot shower.  One of my daughters and I seem to have a problem using any soap (even Dove or Ivory) to clean our faces.  I got a packet of these to try during a promotional give away at my dermatologists office some time back.  I asked her about using the product on my face and she indicated it was one of the better products on the market for people like me who have sensitivity to facial scrubs and soap.  Tried it and liked it especially since it didn't leave my face red and burning.  While this product may not be for everyone, it works for me and my daughter. These facial washing cloths surprised me! Not only do they thoroughly cleanse my face, it leaves it soft and cool. Wonderful in the heat. After using one, i can feel a faint tingle on my skin. The cloths exfoliate and remove dry, dead skin cells, preparing your face for your favourite moisturizer. I notice that my moisturizers seem to go on more smoothly and sink into my skin faster, after wishing wih the cloths. After trying a half dozen, at least of other facial cloths, I'll be using this one from now on. I am impressed! These wipes do a great job at the end of the day, and first thing in the morning to freshen my skin. It easily removes make up. I am in love with just about anything Olay! I started using these last summer when I had shoulder surgery and could only clean my face with one hand and they worked great. Then I started using them at night when I was tired and didn't want to spend extra time with water and cleansers taking off makeup, including eye makeup. These are fast and very effective, and my skin always looks nice in the morning. I'm sold, and keep buying them. BTW I also tried the Olay Total Effects wet clothes and then compared the ingredients and they were identical, it's just that this cloth has a woven pattern on one side that lets you achieve a little more ""scrubbing/dermabrasion"" effect, if you want it. Very refreshing! Great value! Best price I've ever found on these. This is my second purchase of the 3-pack on Amazon and I save several dollars on each purchase. I will continue buying from here as long as the price stays the same or cheaper! Perfect for cleansing face day or night.  It is the cloth your face needs, not rough at all.  Enough moisture to soothe skin and clean dead cells and debris.  Very refreshing when feeling hot due to heat. They do just what I want them to do. I use one before bed at night and they do a good job at washing my face. They don't have a crazy smell and are not very chemical-y so I feel good about using them. I use them around my eyes and have never had any sensitivity or stinging either.There is only one thing that might be a negative, but I don't think it's worth taking a star off for it. These are OK with one day's worth of stubble on my face, but when I use one if I haven't shaved in a while, they get pretty tore up and leave white fuzz all over the place. I don't think that was something Olay was planning on here so I don't hold it against them. Have used these for years and love the convenience.  Cheaper at the store but more convenient to have them delivered. Love Olay products. Am asked often what I use on my skin and always say Olay.  I'm 73 and have very nice skin. These are great cleansing wipes that don't dry the skin. They have a light moisturizing affect but aren't heavily perfumed or irritating. I like these a lot and they smell good. I've had others that I threw away because the smell was nasty. Love this product. Great for quick makeup removal, or as a refreshing wash at day's-end to clear dirt and oil. Packs easily for travel and leaves only clean and soft skin with no residue. Rub it on my hands and arms too for that velvety-soft feeling. My favorite because it doesn't burn my eyes while removing mascara. Great for on the run face cleaning Have used these for years. Very good product for the face. Not harsh. Feels very clean. Hard to find in stores now tho, so always order on line. Sure hope they don't discontinue. I love these! I will buy again when I run out. I love it. This product does not sting or hurt my VERY sensitive skin for makeup remover. I did not have to use any other products such as baby oil to get and traces left behind. It literally got all my makeup off and did not irritate my skin. The micro-exfoliating left my skin very smooth. works great I love using this to take off my makeup! It works great and trust me I have tried plenty this is the best. These are great for a quick clean up. They remove makeup quickly and leave your skin feeling nice - not oily. I do not use them every day, but they are handy to have around! these are great cleansing wipes.  leave my skin feeling soft and smooth and very exfoliated. Definitely worth the extra $$ over the cheaper and store brand cloths.  These do a better job of removing foundation and eye makeup.  Skin feels clean and lightly moisturizer after use these are better than I expected, refreshing and my skin appreciates it. I have Rosacea and it is treated with Retin-A. As a result my skin is very sensitive. These sheets remove make-up and leave my sensitive skin feeling refreshed, clean and non-irritated. I am happy to have found a quick method for cleansing that is gentle. I use regularly and think it helps keep my aging skin smoother. Used to buy at Walmart, but couldn't rely on the product being in stock. It's actually cheaper than Walmart, which sells them as individual packages. Wife loves these. work well Such a great deal.  Over 60% savings from price at the store.These clothes are wonderful! I love these wipes! I have tried others, but these are the best I have found. They leave your face feeling soft. My favorite! The take makeup off so easily and leave my face feeling fresh and soft. easy to use --skin looks and feels better"
B00006FE2Z," Great product ly skin is clear and soft.. Love this product, it's so gently on your face. The best gentle cleansing facial scrub! Love this, my second bottle and it arrived quickly! I love this facial scrub. I have been using it for years. This is so much more affordable than the other stores. I even join the subscription service because it so economical and make my skin feel great and dry at all. After looking at reviews it seemed like this was the best daily face wash that was actually legit and didn't cost $20+ a bottle. Will definitely buy again. Love this cleanser! Just enough exfoliating to leave the skin soft, plus you only use a small amount so it lasts quite awhile! My new ""go to"" I love this stuff. Its my favorite facial scrub plus it is cheaper to buy on line than in the store.  Thanks! Keeps your face really clean and soft! This facial cleanser is wonderful. It has mild exfoliators and is gently enough for daily use. I absolutely love the light citrus scent. Love love this gentle scrub!!  Leaves my face soft and clean and I keep it in the shower.  I think it deals with blackheads, as well. I have been using this as a daily scrub for several years.  It is great for my sensitive skin which tends toward redness.  This scrub does not make my skin red. I love using the Neutrogena Line of facial products.  This smells so good; almost like a creamsicle (showing my age)  When you rinse with water, you can see a shine or glow on your skin. Feels Clean! My skin is so sensitive that some scrubs leave scratches on my face.  This is so gentle that I can even use it on my temples (extra delicate skin). I love this stuff.  It makes your skin feel so fresh and clean.  Great Seller.  Great transaction. This a gentle face scrub and doesn't have a lot of rough granules. I use this scrub and really like it.  It leaves my face feeling clean and fresh. And it isn't too rough.  I found it on Amazon at a better price than what I was able to get at the drug stores.  So I bought this one.  It's a good deal. This is a fantastic scrub for me.  I have very sensitive, oily skin with some dry patches on my face.  I don't experience any irritation when I use this scrub and it doesn't dry my skin out.  I've been using the Neutorogena Oil-Free Deep Clean Cream Cleanser on my face for years because, even at the age of 50, I still get occasional break-outs.  The combination of this scrub with the cleanser has left my face both smooth and clear. I've used this product for several years and I love it! I have the shiniest t-zone you could ever imagine. Any makeup I try to wear slides right off my forehead and nose within 15 minutes. If I use toner or drying soap, my skin overcompensates by getting even *oilier*. This is the first time I've gotten a cleanser that reduces the shine and works for hours. I will be stocking up! Excellent product! Highly recommend! Love! I'm definitely buying again. I enjoy the orangey scent of this product and the (fake?) microbeads. When finished my face looks nice & clean & soft. love it reorder as described I like it Great refreshing and easy use for everyday... gentle on skin.... love it Arrived in a very heavy duty box and quickly. Works well and doesn't dry my face out. Neutrogena is an excellent product...it leaves your skin clear and smooth. I highly recommend all of their skin produts. Great Product. Great Price. Subscription. product of very good quality and with the expected results This is my favorite face wash for about 15 years now! Excellent product with a really good scent.  Hated to see it come off the market due to those little plastic beads. This scrub is really gentle, making it especially good for irritated or sensitive skin, but it also cleans and exfoliates and makes my face feel clean and quite soft to the touch after it is rinsed off. HG exfoliant? Maybe! Very great product . Makes skin soft.  A very nice orange like scent. Little beads help make your skin soft so it works Beyer than I thought  it would an amazing product one of my new favorite products would buy agian!!! Have used this product for years - really like it, and this price was really good. After searching high and low I have finally found the only product that seems to work for me. I don't have really bad skin, but I do have oily skin and my skin is never completely clear. I never have 100% clear skin for longer than a day, because a pimple always seems to appear and form by the next day. I bought affordable products that received multiple rave reviews but it always ended the same for me. With Deap Clean Gentle Scrub, my skin started clearing up almost right away. People noticed that my skin was clearing up and I got various compliments on my skin for the first time. This was the answer to my prayers. I also bought the invigorating foam scrub by neutrogena because it seemed to have very good reviews as well. So after I ran out of my gentle scrub I tried the invogorating foaming scrub. My skin was back to breaking out all over again. That's when I went on Amazon and bought the gentle scrub. It arrived today and boy am I relieved. This is really the only facial scrub for me. It's truly a life saver and for such an affordable price. I will never let you go, ever again. My favorite face wash. Leaves your face feeling minty and fresh! I've used this product for years, only recently started buying it from Amazon.  I have very sensitive skin and Deep Clean Scrub is super gentle and non-irritating.

Excellent product - exfoliating elements are not too course - leaves a clean feeling Works well Not much works on my very oily skin but this face wash has become a staple in my house. Love this its really nice facewash. As described. Great Have used this face wash for over two years and it works really good. Have had many Strokes and have since 07 had very oily skin. I love exfoliation, I exfoliate daily in some way shape or form and this is one of the better exfoliants I've used. It does leave my skin red for a little while after using, but I see the results and love how my skin looks and feels since using it. This is the only product I have found that my teenage daughter can use that doesnt dry out her skin, helps with her acne and doesnt cost a fortune.  It sells out quickly in the stores, so I started ordering it in bulk on-line. Very pleased. Great product,  it really controls the oily shine. This line from neutrogena is great.  It feels refreshing.  It really cleans your skin.  And, is not too harsh for winter. I love this stuff. Smells great and feels great. Try it! The scrub does well on my two teenagers and doesn't appear to be tooharsh- the gently scrub label lives up to its name and their faces areclearer very pleased really excellent product I can recommend it met my expectations so well that I was really very happy thank you I use this once a day in the night to help get all my pores clean from the day.

Our favorite face scrub and cheaper than grocery store I love it I use this every day as a facial wash. Very good. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a good all purpose face wash. works good. i love neutrogena though and have used neutrogena stuff for a while now. i am very please with what it does, and it is not expensive either. other products are throught the roof and do nothing at all. THANKS It is a gentle scrub that clean the skin from greasy and dead cells residues without irritating it. I really recommend it. I couldn't live without my facial scrub.  This product keep my face fresh and clean and YOUNG.  Now my teenage daughter uses it and loves it too!  The calendar says that I am 49, but you wouldn't know it by looking at my skin, yes, you can say some of it is genetics.  I use this facial scrub every day in the shower, LOVE IT! This is truly a deep cleaning face scrub. My niece told me about this recently. I previously used Pevonia gentle exfoliator but, lately I am very disappointed in that product. I tried Neutrogena Deep clean Gentle Scrub for the first time and I loved it. As described, a gentle exfoliator I can use a few times a week. Leaves my skin clean and gets rid of topical dead skin cells on the surface with no residue. My new favorite face scrub!! Check.... and done! This product works just as it says. Your skin feels and looks better in less then a week. I would recomend this product. Absolutely love this face wash! Been using it for years!! I love this cleansing scrub! I have very sensitive skin, and most scrubs leave my face red and irritated. I'm able to use this everyday without irritation!  The scrubbing beads leave my skin soft and clean! I swear by Neutrogena products. I always see and feel an improvement in my skin if I haven't used it for a while, and a continued glow and health in my skin when I use it regularly. Unfortunately, it's not budget friendly for me at my local store, so food wins over my favorite skin care products most of the time. BUT, I found my favorite products here on Amazon for almost $3 less each than in the store, and because I was purchasing bulk products, I paid no shipping with Prime. I have cleansing products to last me months. Very happy! I have pretty dry skin, and living in Colorado, I have to be careful what I use to clean my face.  Also, I have really sensitive skin.  This was a perfect product for me! My skin feels very clean after using it, but not at all dry.  I like the smell and the gentle scrub of it.  I also like that it is available with the subscribe and save.  This is a great feature for products that I tend to forget to re-order until I have run out! Amazon priced this perfectly - identical to in-store. No driving and no shipping cost.Deep clean name refers more to the cream as it contains slightly more astringent to give that ""taught and clean"" feeling. The grains are fine and not aggressively coarse like St. Ives.  Use this every other night and lasts for about 4-5 months. I use this facial scrub in conjunction with Neutrogena Oil-Free Deep Clean Cream Cleanser, 7 Ounce, and I have to say, these two products make quite the knock-out combo. This scrub is gentle enough that it doesn't irritate your face but potent enough to scrub away dead skin and leave your complexion brighter and clearer. I also adore the smell of it -- kind of a fresh, orangey scent. The only thing I enjoy smelling more first thing in the morning is my coffee. :)Highly recommended! I have used this product for almost ten years now.  I RARELY get acne, and have always been told I have beautiful skin.  This is my secret and I share it with many... and then they get hooked as well.  This cleanser really is INVIGORATING.  It feels like your face is freezing, which really helps wake me up.  Love this product, I am a lifetime user. I've used this scrub for years. I have sensitive skin and will break out with a lot of facial wash or scrub. I need something gentle yet tough enough since i get dry skin build up on my forehead. This is gentle but will also keep my face soft and smooth. I recommend to everyone, I can't live without this product. Most effective product I've used. And I've used a whole bunch of 'em. Funny that dermatologists continue to recommend Purpose, which is nowhere near as good as this. Makes you wonder what kind of contract they have. If it weren't for that, they would (and should) recommend this. I have used this product for many years.  I use it mostly in the winter, and it is the only facial scrub I've used that doesn't leave my skin a little raw. My face feels clean and smooth, not dried out in any way and leaves no redness. I love it. I have been using this oi-free deep clean gentle scrub for more than 10 years. There is no question about it: I LOVE it!!!!! Really like the cool minty feel after you use the product.  Leaves your skin feeling reinvigorated.  I use it with my Clarisonic Mia. Doesn't leave your skin feeling tight and dry.  LOVE Neutrogena products. >It was really great~!^^I didn't actually expected for it to arrive in just four days~! Better than I've thought~!^^Thank you very much~!^ (> ^_^ <) Love this face scrub. The beads are really tiny and don't irritate your face. Ive been using this for years and it has helped clear up breakouts on my forehead. Luv the product and especially the price GReat! Excellent facial cleaning product!! You can actually feel the difference when using this. Highly recommend!! I enjoy this face wash  It is cooling and refreshing and not drying. I was pleased to find it in a three pack on amazon. Great product to use every day or when you feel you need a little extra exfoliation.  My teenagers like it, as do I. My husband and I use it...we LOVE IT....this is always on repeat in the checkout cart! It actually eliminates excess oil without drying out my skin . Amazing Love the little scrubbing beads!  My face feels GREAT after I use it! Im using this product for 3 years and its really good i like that A good beaded facial scrub and I love Neutrogena products. I absolutely LOVE this scrub- its like when you chew really spicy mint gum, then take a deep breath, only its all over your face! it leaves me feeling fresh and clean, and i've seen great results in the past 2 months i've been using this product. This does work on my face very well. It helped the redness on my face go away very quickly, I was impressed.The only thing about face creams and face liquids that may be important to know if you want great and fast result is you need to use at least more than two. Because If you use only one kind of face treatment there will come a day your face will get so use to it that treatment will no longer be useful. Ever since I've used 4 different Neutrogena my face has really improved. Before trying this product, I was using Clean and Clear's Morning Burst... which was alright... except it didn't have the awesome microbeads that scrubs your face. It also dried out my nose a lot, which wouldn't go away even after I used lotion. So I gave this product a try because of all the 5 star reviews. It works really well! I generally have pretty good skin, with the exception of my forehead which would get one pimple after another. Literally. One day a pimple would show up (which also hurts!), the next day it would die down and a new one would start to appear! I have been using this product for the past 2 months and currently have an entirely CLEAR face (and oh so soft)! Although half of this month, I tried to use both the Neutrogena and the Clean and Clear (because I didn't want to waste my money). Using both was a mistake.. It really worked best when I stuck to one product... which would be the Neutrogena. Of course it dries the face a bit, but not as much as my morning burst. It works as awesome as it smells. I've even stopped wearing foundation! The only thing I put on my face now is a little blush, sunscreen and Neutrogena Deep Clean Invigorating Foaming Scrub! great Great product! I received this product on Friday and I've been using for 3 days now and it has been great.  My face gets really clean and very smooth and a cold refreshing after effect.  Best face wash I've used so far.  I recommended. This product has a great smell and really feels like it gets your face clean.  It feels great going on and also coming off.  I love this product! This works great.  It leaves a nice, clean, tingly feeling after the wash.  Highly recommend. I have been using Neutrogena Deep Clean facial scrub for quite some time with great results. It gets expensive when buying at drug stores, so order in bulk from Amazon and save - plus free shipping.?..no brainer... Works well if you're looking for a product to give a deep scrub! I've been using this for about 3 years now This face wash seems to leave me at least thinking my face is cleaner.  No clue if it is or not, but those little bead things are convincing.  Whatever, it's neon blue. This works and the little pellets, they say, are biodegradable so the fact that the particles are so small that they do not get filtered out during the sewage treatment phase (and are so light they stay on the surface) is a plus. I have sensitive skin that is super oily and very prone to breakouts. I wear a good amount of makeup because of the breakouts. So, it's tricky to find a face soap serious enough to clean deep into my pores and remove all the makeup and oil while still being gentle enough not to cause more ugly face problems. I previously used St. Ives apricot scrub but it's just too harsh of a scrub. It's like rubbing sand on your face. I also tried cetaphyl but it had zero scrubbing power and my face went crazy with breakouts. This soap works much better on my skin. The tiny beads are enough to scrub deep but it's still gentle. I've see a vast improvement since I started using it. This stuff saved my skin! I was having really bad breakouts out of no where. And i always had amazing skin. These breakout just starting poppin up and they would be right next to each other causing me to end up the big blothes of dark spots on my face because of how close the blackheads where to each other. Anyway.. a friend recommend this product and i haven't had a blackhead in over a month!!! Not only that put my skin is soo soft and glows so bright. Even my dark spots have lightly faded!  Also this product washes away makeup like its butter!! So easily! Im stocking up on these asap!!! Thanks Neutrogena! I've been using this for about a year and it helps my skin a lot and if I get a pimple and use this it goes away the next morning. It's crazy!!! Allot of people could use this product alone to stop breakouts if they have moderate adult acne but people with bigger adult acne problems should really try this product and Oxy Maximum Daily Face Wash along with controlling or eliminating processed sugars in their diet before resorting to a Dermatologist. I have spent ALLOT of money on Dermatologist appointments, medications (which often damage the liver), and the MD's brand of acne wash - all of which did little more in the long term than damage to my body and wallet.My first hand recommendation for moderate to severe adult acne. While in the shower, use this product, rinse, then use Oxy Maximum Daily Face Wash w/ 10% Benzoyl Peroxide (same amount of BP as the MD wash) and rinse. If starting during a severe breakout, perform 2x per day but no more (because of skin drying). You should see results within 2-3 days and clear skin within 1-4 weeks (depending on severity of the infection). Finally, listen to your body before listening to the flip/flop notion that diet doesn't play a part in acne - certain refined/processed sugars (usually from desserts and candy) provoke skin secretions that initiate and worsen acne. I don't know how this treatment would work on teen acne but I wish I had the chance to try it when I was a teen.Good luck! This is the best morning facewash I've tried for my oily skin.  I've always had extremely oily skin, and usually notice I'm very shiny after just a few hours.  With this wash in the morning and the neutrogena shine control primer, I'm matte all day.  I've never found another product or combination that is even half as effective as this.  I got away from it, trying many professional products with bold promises, but have come back to this again.  This is my holy grail product. I am in love with this face wash. I love trying different products and have never really used Neutrogena. But I wanted to give it a shot and I am glad I did! My skin feels sooo soft after using this! I also have a hard time using face washes that don't smell good but I love the smell of this face wash! It's not really strong but it's strong enough to smell after washing it off. It is a citrus scent, to me it smells like grapefruit. So good! It cleanses very impeccably and leaves you with soft skin and a clean feeling. I reccommend you give it a shot! I ended up ordering other Neutrogena products after using this and they are just as great! I started using this stuff after a roommate left some behind when she moved out. It REALLY exfoliated my face. To the point that my skin was  a peeling mess for about a month. Big chunks of skin came off around my nose, where I'm prone to blocked pores and blackheads, since I have oily skin. After about a month, all the old skin was exfoliated and my face was smooth. Really like this product.  It really seems to brighten up my face and washes off make-up well. I never had oily skin until this past year or so. It came out of nowhere and I had no idea how to control it. I did everything from switching from a liquid to powder makeup (which helped a little) to switching moisturizers, cleansers, and blotting excessively all day. It was horrible and embarrassing having to carry around a little kleenex to control the shine. On a whim, I decided to purchase this product and I must say I am SO happy it worked!!! Normally I wash my face before bed and wake up to oily skin in the morning and throughout the day. I use this product at night and in the morning. I can honestly say I have gone all day in hot and humid  without having to blot my face once! It even makes my make up look better. The microscrubbers are also a plus to help with exfoliation. I FINALLY feel like I have my old skin back!!!!I received my box for free for the purpose of my review but these opinions are 100% my own I've been using this for about two years now and people keep telling me that my skin looks great. I have combination/sensitive skin (the kind that flakes or looks red) so take it from me, THIS WILL DO YOU NO HARM. I haven't used makeup in months! LOVE THIS STUFF. I like the texture and that its light and oil free I was using this product for 2 years until a year ago, and in those 2 years my skin looked the BEST it has ever been in my life. This cleanser is gentle yet cleans SO well. It goes deep down into your pores and takes the dirty stuff right out. My skin is oily and I've been struggling with really bad clogged pores and blackhead/whiteheads and occasional inflamed pimples  for as long as I can remember! All those problems were gone when I was using this product. But about a year ago I decided to switch around and see what else is out there. I decided to switch to much more ""gentle"" cleansers designed for normal skin instead of oily skin. And my face has been going downhills ever since...Now I again have a lot of clogged pore and whiteheads that are SOOOO annoying :( I'm gonna switch back to this product tonight and hopefully it will salvage my face like it once did! nice face wash, doesn't dry too badly. We love this product. I decided to buy this item because I read that Kanye West uses this and requests it for his dressing room when on the road. I decided that if Kim Kardasian has Kanye using it, then it must be good. It is a good product. Great purchase! Very good price. I have only been using it for about a week and so far so good with this product. My face is prone to having an oily T-zone, and this product sure does a good job in removing shine from the area for a couple of hours. I wish I didn't wait so long to try it. I'll probably have to wait another month or so to see if my skin gets used to this product, to determine if I need to add anything extra to mix and match with. Love this! This is by far the best scrub I've used! The consistency and scent reminds me of the St. Ives scrub for blackheads. I only switched products b/c all of the sudden, I had barely any blackheads, and I woke up to my face being super shiny 😞. At first, I was afraid to try a new product b/c my skin is REALLY sensitive, but after the first use, I definitely noticed my face didn't have as much shine as it did before and YAY! my skin didn't have any reaction to this scrub 😁. I now use this scrub everyday and my skin even feels like its improving. I also use the shine control power from Neutrogena after, that makes even a bigger difference!! Thank you Neutrogena!! Its true to its word, this stuff is for shine control. I have out of control oily skin and hair, and though this doesn't keep my skin clear all day, it truly works for oily skin. I use this twice a day, in the morning in the shower and at night before bed, and my skin would absolutely ridden with acne. Being allergic to salicylic acid, this product stunningly doesn't bother me. I noticed that if I leave it on as a mask, I do find that cooling, cleaning feeling (I know that this product is offered as a mask, and the concentration of salicylic acid is too high for my skin). I find that around the 5 or 6 hour mark after i've washed my face, it's oily again, but the blotting sheets keep my face clear for the rest of the day. Of course, while this clears away shine, I do recommend using an oil-free, non-comedogenic moisturizer after using, simply because it keeps your skin from producing natural oils to keep it hydrated (not because I found this product drying in any way). Very good productThanks I love this product. First of all, It smells like St.Joseph's Aspirin For Children. That's an orange candy smell. It's refreshing and delicious. ""Refreshing"" is the best word for this scrub. It freshens my face in the summer by scrubbing off the layers of sweaty dead skin and sun lotion, and it freshens my complexion in the winter by sloughing off the dead winter skin. I have combination skin, and this scrub softens and cleans and balances and leaves me with soft fresh skin. I LOVE THIS. Sometimes I get bored and buy something else, but I always go right out and buy more of this scrub. I can't live without it. It's one of the best facial scrubs I've ever purchased. Have been using this facial wash for the last 10-15 years. Never had a pimple as long as I was using it. Love love this facial wash. So glad to replenish my supply easily and quickly. Thanks! I have a very shine and oily skin on my T-zone, it is so shining and you could see a reflection from the mirror.  It looks dirty during the day.  I bought Neutrogena's long lasting deep clean oil control cleanser/mask and use it on my face once every day, it worked like a charm.  My oily skin is under control, it really worked and I love this cleanser, it is very gentle, leaves my skin very soft and smooth after.  No more shine for long time, yes a day! I have stayed with this product for several months and will continue using it. Neutrogena Deep Clean Long-Last Shine Control, Cleanser/mask, 6 Ounce (Pack of 2) Works great to remove the dust i get on face from riding my motorcycle It is a miracle. Not great for the environment -- micro balls in lakes.  But it certainly has made a huge difference for me in terms of complexion. I have tried numerous scrubs, facial cleansers and this is by far the best one I have ever used! I have very sensitive skin and also suffer from severe eczema. This product has cleared up my face a great deal and not once has irritated my eczema. This is perfect for anyone suffering from eczema or really sensitive skin. Arrived promptly, in perfect condition, and exactly as described.  Thank you! ok so i used to use this all the time when i was a teenager and had GORG skin with maybe one pimple every so often. Everyone used to compliment me on how beautiful my skin was. Then i stopped and idk why i ever did . Im 25 now and started to break out, out of no where! tried alot of cleansers but still oily skin and break outs. dr put me on birth control ortho tri cyclon lo and my break outs reduced ALOT but still some. I started using this and 1 week later CLEAR BEAUTIFUL SKIN!! gives you a deep clean and makes your skin SOOO smooth. Won't stop using this anymore . I learned my lesson. Great product Really love it,will buy it again Does what it says, controls oil and shine!!! It's summer in California and my skin started getting oily and sunscreen wasn't helping. This product is amazing. I can use serum, moisturizer, and SPF without getting oily!!! Amazing! Cheap too, I got this for around $5. Works well to keep skin clean and exfoliated. Gentle cleansing of facial skin. great Both my boyfriend and I use this face scrub and love it. One of the reasons he uses it is because it does not smell feminine, it has a neutral odor to it. Its a white, creamy like scrub. I use it in the shower on my face and neck before I wash my face with the cleanser in the morning. I like it because it gets all the dead skin off and leaves my face feeling fresh.  My boyfriend says it helps with ingrown hairs on his face.  I highly recommend this product for both men and women and with this price its unbeatable. Great product!! I used to use the deep clean invigorating facial scrub which was effective...it made my face feel clean but it made my skin very dry and tight after using it so I could only use it once or twice a week. This scrub is basically the same thing except it has smaller beads and much gentler on the skin. It doesn't dry out my skin and it leaves it with the same clean and refreshed feeling as the invigorating scrub. I use this scrub every other day in the shower; on the other days I use the neutrogena microdermabrasion kit which is also a phenomenal product. During a trip overseas and my regular Neutrogena face wash disappearing I was left with few options and so I picked up a bottle of this at a local import shop. I love this stuff. After just a few days of using it I noticed my skin became so clean and it not only eliminated all my blackheads (and I do mean all) a my skin also began to exude a youthful glow that I hadn't seen since I was a kid. The only con to my experience using Neutrogena Deep clean would have to be that maybe after a couple weeks my skin dried up a little, but a few days of giving this scrub a break and I was back to using it not to mention I have not had one pimple since using this regularly and that definitely  deserves a 5 star rating in my eyes! I use it every other day for scrubbing and it's a great face product to remove the dead skin without hurting or drying a sensitive skin type. I was worried about my oily skin type. But after using Neutrogena Deep Clean Gentle Scrub, I felt less oily on my face. I recommend this cleanser very strongly to everyone who are worried about her oily skin. I would like to advise everyone to use this in the shower only to ensure you are rinsing all the grains off your face.  I like the texture of the scrubbing beads and the foaming lather, and the product cleans just fine, but the menthol made my month and eyes sting the first time then I was good to go the next time.  I started following instructions and I do apply around my eye area and month area with I keep my month closed!  LOL  It does not seem so strong anymore:) I'm almost sensitive to any products! My skin is clear and no more breakouts!Please use a quarter size.  Don't be heavy handed.I am 47 years old. This works great for me and I am getting compliments on my skin. I have been using this 4 days now.  I would not use on my daugthers teenage spots. (12) It does not contain 2.5% benzoyl and peroxide. This line have everything for everybody. This is the only product that stops me from breaking out. I've tried to replace it with Neutrogena's Deep Clean Facial Cleanser (the golden crap that looks like hand soap), Clean and Clear deep clean action exfoliating scrub, Bioré's revitalizing 4-in-one self-foaming cleanser, and equate's blackhead cleaning scrub. Nothing works for me except this. Some of the products I've mentioned make my face feel like it's sun burned and dry out my skin. Now I have 4 bottles of crap that I don't use and an empty bottle of Neutrogena's Deep Clean, it's the only crap that works. I'm a guy and I approve this product. I've been using Neutrogena deep clean invigorating foaming scrub for about two months now and have become quite attached to it!  Recently I read about how important it is for people of a certain age to exfoliate their skin daily and so I bought this scrub to give it a try.  I am happy with the results!I also like the energizing microbeads with tingly cool lather. This feels great at the end of the day.A 4.2 fluid ounce tube lasts me just over a month, using it every night.  I plan on continuing to use this product! Great product !  But ... $49 for 3 tubes = $16 per 4 oz tube ?  Sells for $5-$6 in most stores (Safeway, CVS, etc.)Update ... looks like the price has been changed from $49 for 3 tubes to $22 for 3 tubes ... more reasonable but still more expensive than I've seen at the local retail stores. Generally, I love Neutrogena scrubs. They are gently and don't hurt the skin but are extremely effective in keeing blackheads and pimples under control. This new scrub is awesome and has a cool feel on the skin. I am very happy with it! Would recommend this product to any person whether you have pimples or not.It works!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
B004DJWDN6," Smells awesome and cleans good. Perfect Smells nice Very refreshing ☺️ I use a little on my Miro pure facial brush and they both get the job done my skin feels nice and looks brighter I love this productIt actually levels out my skin tone which is great when I have acne scars.It dose leave my skin a little dry but nothing moisturizer can't help Pretty good for clearing your skin, especially after makeup. good face wash and does brighten. Gets all the make up out ,went back to Neutrogena cream cleanser just for a change but I can easily say the difference it didn't clean up throughly.So never going back to any other cleansers. love it , really wakes me up and feels refreshed I love this cleanser for morning clean-up in the shower before I shave. It kind of tingles (I think it's actually cooling the skin), and it leaves my skin feeling moisturized yet clean. GREAT product! Will continue to use! It's a great product. Clean & Clear delivers consistent results that clears my skin. It also has the tingling feeling which is great. Great product One of the best face washes around. Better than the orange in my opinion! Awsum really great. I have a dry sentitive face. Its the only face wash that doesnt break me out It it a good facial cleanser, I've been seeing nice results. Skin feels a little dry afterwards though. Works great though I love this face wash. I use it every morning and it feels like it wakes me up. you should get it This soap is great!  It smells really good, like citrus, but not too sour.  It smells very sweet at the same time.  It removes all of the oil from my face, but the oil does come back pretty soon (that's my face's fault, not the soap).  The bursting beads feel good on your face, too, and it leaves you with that tingly feeling you get when you scrub your face really well.  I would definitely buy this soap again! I love it! It doesnt cause me break outs, its oil free and its refreshing!!! What else you need?? Its the perfect wake up in the morning for your skin. This is a great face wash the smell is great. You can notice a cleaner face just after one wash, I recommend this product if you are looking for a great daily wash. Would recommend feels very nice on your face Love it! Works so well Tried many types of face wash and this one is the best, by far. Doesn't dry my skin. Clears up any blemishes and smells amazing! Ever since trying this out, I haven't looked back and continue to buy this product. This product does NOT cause breakouts.It smells nice.I use it morning and night.The orange one is also fantastic if you're looking at the different ones. I am torn between which I like better so I switch between the two. Since I'm one to always need a burst in the morning, when I was on the hunt recently for new face products I had to try Clean and Clear Morning Burst. A special that was going on prompted me to buy the cleanser and get the facial scrub for half off - excellent! I'm happy to report that I enjoy both products. They both have caffeine, lemon and papaya , smell great, and seem to work for me. The cleanser is obviously softer on my skin than the scrub, but both make my skin feel soft and clean after use. I also bought the skin brightening line, and I have to say that I truly believe they do that. I'm very impressed with both these products, and know I will definitely purchase the cleanser again, if not the facial scrub as well. I will buy more from the Clean and Clear line! I'm not obsessed with skin care, and don't have thousands skin-care items. But I love this cleanser, because:1) This is a good cleanser.2) It smells fantastic.3) It helps wake you up.4) It is easy to wash off5) My acne scars are almost gone.What I don't like about it:1) Drying (depends on your skin type)2) Doesn't get rid of pimples3) It is too gentle (I'd prefer something with strong beads)4) I noticed my skin became more sensitive to the sun. However, it could be anything..Overall, it's cheap and good, and I would recommend this to a friend. Clean & Clear Morning Burst Skin Brightening Cleanser, 8-OunceWorks like a charm i have 7 of them wroks in 3 days love it Love the smell and how well this product works!! nice face wash I am a big fan! I love this product . Have been using it for two Years now, I have sensitive acne prone skin but it never broke me out, it actually treats break outs from other cosmetic . I love it! Will continue to use it! Thank you I love this face wash! It made my skin feel smoother and I like the fresh lemon smell. The price is also good and it lasts a long time. Will buy again. This is a new product for me and I've only used it once, but so far I love it! It smells great and you can't beat the price! Thanks! Removes oil from face & gives you a fresh clean look & feel. I love it."
B01EMYN18M," Over the past year, I've been searching for a new face wash that's not too drying for my aging skin (63 yrs old). Having tried numerous brands without success, I decided to try the Aveeno Active Naturals Positively Radiant Daily Scrub (in a tube). Unfortunately, though it was described as being gentle, it was too drying for me to use every day, however, I found the scent pleasant and liked the very fine scrubbing beads. In continuing my search, in the Aveeno Active Naturals Positively Radiant line, I found this cleanser. It is working for me to use daily, with the Face Scrub once per week as an exfoliator. I am still a tiny bit dry so I just use a little more moisturizer, especially around my lips and eyes. At least for now, this seems to be a pretty good regime. I love positively radiant cleanser. A little goes a long way. One pump is enough to get my face lathery and clean. It doesn't irritate my skin and the price works well for me. nothing specific to say about this order. packaging was good, no problems Excellent product.  I have used it for a long time I love the way this smells, and it doesn't dry out my skin. Perfect ! This is the best brightening Cleanser on the market. I've used for several years and it's totally changed my face. Love this product I love it!!!Cleans my face and it doesn't leave a dry feeling. It also removes make up beautifully. It cleans the face easily and washed off easily. It does dry the face a little. A nice daily cleanser! I use it after I've removed my makeup for a better clean. It leaves my face feeling fresh! My go to facial cleanser, gentle yet deep cleans leaving behind brighter skin.Highly recommended for all ages. Love this face wash.  I have been using it for years.  It's gentle on the face and doesn't dry it out. SMELLS NICE. I LIKE IT Love it!  Gentle and removes most of my makeup. Really a good cleanser! I love it!"
B00BCKOWWE," I love this skincare line.  I wanted something affordable, easy to use and natural for my 10 year old daughters sensitive skin.  It has worked wonderfully, even cleared up the tiny bit of acne she was having. This was exactly what I needed for my tween.  The products are gentle (she has sensitive skin) so she never got irritated.  She also felt more ""grown up"" with her own skincare products. It's important to me that she starts learning proper skin care now and forms good habits and these products encourage her to do so! I also loved that it doesn't have all those scary ingredients I don't want her using- it's the perfect transition from her baby products. Now I can order the larger containers! After just a few days of use, I saw a big change in my 12 year old daughter's skin. This product has helped to tame her breakouts and her skin looks visibly clearer. Thank you for providing a trusted skin regime that's all natural. Really like these products.  My oldest daughter is 8 years old and glad I can start her on the right path of caring for her skin early!  Nice to find a product that is simple and natural. Excellent cleanser and facial care products for my preteen daughter! The gift was for my teenage niece and she loved it My 9 year old daughter started getting a little pimple here and there. I was searching for a cleansing system for her that would be gentle for her young skin, and I found this! SHE LOVES IT!! She is very happy because it's geared towards girls, which she loves, and most importantly, it's VEGAN and CRUELTY FREE! That makes this 9 year old vegan little lady have a very happy and clean face! My daughter has just started her skin care journey and we love this brand.  It has good ingredients and is gentle on her skin. I purchased this kit for my daughters 11th birthday and she loves it. I was introduced to this product line when I purchased a ""my first period kit"" for my daughter and the cleanser was included in the kit. I thought this was a nice beginners kit for facial cleansing made with all natural ingredients just for her. The packaging is also very cute and girly😊 Great for my tween just starting out using skin care products. My daughter loves them!"
B071KPNHNQ," It has a pleasant refreshing smell. My face feels very clean and soft after using it. Great for the skin. Makes it feel refreshed. I love it. I have been using this cleanser a few weeks. It's working better than my store bought cleaners (cetaphil/neutragena). I feel it leaves my skin soft, it's clearing up blemishes and most importantly it's not drying out my skin as most products tend to do. Because of how much better I feel it's cleans my skin without drying it, I plan to keep using it. I love their moisturizer so I thought I would give the facial cleanser a go.  I really Like it.  It has very little, if any fragrance, which is good for those of us with sensitivities.  It only take a little,  the size of a pea and I get great lather and my face doesn't feel dried out.  Also I noticed that because this is a smooth cleanser, I don't have any red rashy irritation from the ""Scrubbing action""  another thing I have experienced with any scrub.  I will adding this to my little bag of gotta haves and buying this one again. Perhaps even getting two so one can stay in the shower and one can sit with my toothbrush,  Just think I wouldn't have to walk that extra 5 steps to the shower to retrieve it  :D This facial cleanser is AMAZING!!!  I have tried so many products and I can easily say that ESSA VitaClarify is of very high quality. It's all natural and as soon as you use it you will feel how clean and refreshing it is on your face and neck.  I did not have to use a lot of the product for it to work on a light lather using warm water.  I felt some tingling while massaging it in circular motions on my skin then I rinsed it away using cold water.  After drying my face I also tried ESSA's Vita-C-Whip to moisturize my skin.  I am so happy with this product and would recommend it to everyone. I am constantly on the lookout for facial cleansers that cleanse my face effectively writing drying me out. The Essa Vita Clarify does just that. This thick cleanser utilizes Alpha Lipoic Acid, vitamins A, B, C, and E to clans, exfoliates and nourish the skin. It is also paraben, sulfate and phthalates free.The formula is a “pearlessence” (look like a pearl) which can mean that it is moistening to the skin. The scent reminds me of cucumber and though I prefer unscented skin care products, the smell is not offensive or irritating. It lathers nicely without it being too foamy.  I use it with my hands or my Clairsonic and it works well either. This is one of the most luxurious and moisturizing face wash I have ever tried. The smell alone is enough to make you a believer, but the way it nourishes my skin while clearing it up just drives it home. I have been using this for a little over 2 weeks now, and my skin is clearing up from the inevitable blemishes of the season change. I use only a light moisturizer after this, since it seems to keep my skin hydrated as it is. I highly recommend this natural face wash for clearing up your face while keeping it soft, moisturized and nourished! I don't want or need a cleanser that strips my skin and leaves it feeling dry and tight, but I also want a cleanser that will actually clean my face effectively.  VitaClarify feels great on my skin and doesn't leave it feeling like I need to immediately smear moisturizer on my face before I even dry it.  A little goes a long way.  The smell is minimal, a light fragrance somewhat like a cucumber scent.  (Not my favorite, but it's not overpowering so I can live with it.)  Just a tiny bit is more than adequate to cover my entire face, and after I rinse it off my skin is squeaky clean with no tightness.  I usually buy Cetaphil, but actually prefer this more. I am very impressed with this Vita Clarify Facial Cleanser. A small amount is all that's really needed when washing your face. This has been one of the best face washes I have used. It removes all dirt, oils and makeup from my face. It has also given my skin a refreshed and vibrate glow. I also use the TruSkin's Toner, Rose Water Toner for day time & the Super Toner for night time, as for the serums I use the C serum for day time and HA serum at night. Their new eye cream works really well! I always wake up with puffy eyes and I have dark circles ""my forever on going issue"" this product has worked wonders on me. It gives my eyes a brighter look it also helps my under eyes look hydrated since under my eyes is always a dry part of my skin, this has helped me drastically. I love to finish off my skin care routine with C moisturizing cream i just absolutely love the way it makes my skin feel and look . I do however apply an SPF moisturizer on top of the C moisturizer as it doesn't have any SPF but only in the AM. I highly recommend Essa Skin Care products I am very pleased with my results and can not imagine myself with out them. ESSA - VitaClarify - Premium Multi Vitamin Organic Facial Cleanser for Wrinkle and Skin Blemish Reduction and Anti Aging Support. (4 oz)I have been looking for a facial cleanser that doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. I have used moisturizers from Essa Skin Care with great results and was very excited to try this cleanser.First, a little goes a long way. You need only a small amount to clean your whole face and neck. There is no strong scent associated with this product. I have been using it for two weeks, and I am quite pleased with the results. My face feels clean, but not dried out. My skin is soft and smooth. I am fifty years old, and my age is beginning to show. Keeping my skin healthy is important to me, and I believe this has been a great addition to my skin care regimen. I purchased the ESSA Skin Care VitaClarify to help get my skin back its healthy look.  I worry about trying new products because of my sensitive skin.  To the touch the product is soft and creamy.  Its scent is amazing.  I love the way it makes my skin feel after applying it.  That feeling last for almost the entire day.  My blotchiness has gotten so much better and the dry patches are going away.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  If it can help my sensitive skin, it can help anyone. This is my first time using this skin care line and I bought it because a gf recommended it to me. I am so sick of all of the cleansers out there that leave my skin feeling stripped and dry. The VitaClarify experience was amazing.  The smell was light and pleasing.  I used about the size of a dime and worked it into my face.  The product produced a nice light lather and rinsed away easily.  My skin felt clean and refreshed afterwards.  I definitely will continue using this line and I am interested in checking out their other products.  I am very please with the blend of ingredients and how they made my skin feel. This ESSA Vitaclarify Premium Multi Vitamin Organic Facial Cleanser has been wonderful! I am pregnant and I have been breaking out like a teenager lately. I was worried I would just have to put up with my skin like this until after I gave birth. I starting using this facial cleanser the day it came in the mail. It has a very silky feel and a nice, fresh scent. Within 3 days my skin was already starting to clear up. After 2 weeks, I don't have any new pimples at all. I will be using this skin cleanser throughout my entire pregnancy and longer! I love the Vita-C lotion and was really excited to try their facial cleanser. I have not been disappointed, this is a great everyday cleanser that doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. With most cleansers, I cannot use them on a daily basis but I have been using this for the past two weeks with absolutely no irritation or reaction at all. It is a light cleanser with a slight scent but definitely not overpowering. It rinses clean and leave my skin feeling soft, not dried out or tight. This is a great cleanser and I am very happy with the results. I bought this to use in conjunction with the Vita C whip this company makes. It definitely made me feel like my face was clean.You use it by wetting your face and putting a small amount on and lathering into your skin and then gentlt washing it off and patting dry. What I love most about this Essa Cleanser is that it's full of essential vitamins. I love this brand of face care products and this one is another favorite.  I love the mild sweet smell to the face wash and how clean it leaves my skin feeling.  I only have to use a small amount to completely wash my face.  It leaves my face feeling nourished and soft.  It has great antioxidants in it which I am a fan of and is an organic formula which is important to me.  Another great product from this brand - I have felt like my skin is soft and younger looking since using this product. Soft cleanser, lightly scented, with just the right amount of lather (not too much, not too little).  My face doesn't feel tight or stripped after using, which I appreciate on my 50-ish skin.  No burning eyes either, since when I wash my face it always includes my eye area.  Other vitamin C washes I've used have made me cry and left me feeling like a raisin in the desert.  This one is so pleasant to use.  I like it enough to buy it again - now that's saying something! I've been using the Vita-C whipped from Essa and have been super thrilled with the results, so when I found out they added this cleaner no doubt I had to added to my collection. Needless to say I'm a fan. This is a great gentle cleaner I can use daily. It doesn't dry out the skin but yet leave it feeling clean. Will definitely be buying more of this for my skin regimen. I really love the way this facial cleanser makes my skin feel. after using this facial cleanser my face feels fresh and clean. I Also love the way it smells. I am using this for my daily cleanser and liking a lot better than the last facial cleanser I was using. You don't need to use very much a little goes a long ways, I'm sure this 4 ounce tube will last me quite a while.I like that it contains Vitamins A , B and C all of which are great to help my skin and complexion. I really love this product and I would recommend it to all my friends. This facial cleanser works great!  I put it on and do as the directions say and put some of the cleanser on with water and massage in circular motions and then rinse it off.  My face feels smooth and refreshed after.  My skin has always been very dry and this does not dry it out. I love that it is organic which is what I try to use all the time. I will continue to use this.  I love it! I have only been using this cleanser for a few days. I am in love with it. First off it smells fantastic it's very fragrant without being over the top in smell. I've notice my face feels and looks better since I started using it. I used this cleanser after using the essa exfoliant and skin felt amazing. I would definitely recommend. I did get a discount for purchasing this product. love essa skin care!!  this facial cleanser is great--soft, gently, and no obnoxious smell. i used it day and evening but i rotate with a scrub some mornings. love the company's products and have yet to be disappointed. also use their vita c whip face cream. facial cleanser doesn't foam too much with lather, but it is NOT a foaming face wash lol!! love , will purchase again. Excellent product.  I purchased this product about a month ago.  I have been using it daily and have noticed a marked improvement in my skin.  Very deep cleaning and leaves my skin feeling soft.  I would highly recommend this product. I simply love the VitaClarify facial cleanser.  I love the fact there are vitamins in this cleanser that address my two facial needs. It is almost impossible to find a cleanser that address both wrinkles and blemishes.  I use about a dime size of the cleanser and enjoy the light scent that does not irritate my sensitive my skin at all. After cleansing my skin my face feels soft, refreshed, with no film residue feeling left.  I know this product being filled with vitamins and being organic, my skin is going to be great. VitaClarify is a great daily natural skin cleaner to add to my skin care regimine. The product is free of harsh chemicals, gently cleaning and refreshing. If you are looking to avoid harsh chemicals found in many products these days I highly recommend VitaClarify. Fresh scent is relaxing and it leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed. No residual soap film left after washing so you know the product is cleaning and natural. I can’t rave enough about this product line, and this product isn’t any different. The smell is amazing, and the feeling after I use the product is great. It leaves my skin so soft! I love this cleanser. I have sensitive skin and it is perfect for me.  It doesn't dry or irritate my skin.  Rinses clean.I like that it vegan friendly, cruelty free, organic ingredients, and made without parabens, sulfates, pthalates, or harsh ingredients that may strip and irritate the skin.It also removes my makeup! No needs to scrub my eyes and they gently rinse clean.LOVE IT! This stuff smells SO good, I can't overstate it. Honestly even if it made me breakout in horrible rashes (which it didn't, to be clear) I don't know if I would be able to give it a bad review, because it smells so good. Fortunately it also seems to work pretty well! It takes makeup off easily, and it doesn't make my face super dry. The first thing I noticed was the wonderful scent of this product. It goes on smoothly and creamy and washes off clean. I look forward to washing my face because this product makes it a reviving and calming experience. The dispenser is appropriate and will allow me to get the last drop out. I would definitely recommend this product. very happy with the essa vitaclarify face wash. it’s pretty gentle on my skin. i have been just steaming clean my face because most are too harsh for my skin and break me out, but this is great! it does dry my t zone out a tiny bit, but my daily moisturizer fixes that in a jiffy. for being on the more “value friendly” end of the price spectrum, it’s awesome. overall very happy and would definitely buy it again! The first thing I noticed when I used this facial cleanser was the smell.  It has a very pleasant orange scent that's not overpowering at all.  I like that it has natural ingredients. It also has a nice fluid texture, not granular or harsh at all.  I washed my face as usual, and this product felt great going on. After drying off my face feels great. The skin doesn't feel too dry but it's not oily either. I would recommend for all skin types. I am really loving this face wash.  It is safe for sensitive skin and smells awesome. It reminds me of ""awapuhi shampoo"".  Removes make up really well, non-irritating, and has visibly reduced my bumps and pores over the past two weeks. I would definitely recommend it and will continue to use it. Love this VitaClarify daily face wash from Essa Skin Care!! It cleans the skin very well, feels so smooth and smells wonderful! I really like the texture and can tell this is a high quality product!  My skin feels refreshed, and as if my pores have been cleaned out and are smaller! I highly recommend this product and I have a feeling I will be using it for years to come! First of all I love the packaging! It's orange and classy yet simple. Maybe that's what happens when you use natural ingredients. As with my other Essa product there is a light pleasant smell.I washed my face as usual and after drying off I can't get over how soft my face feels!! I can move with out my face feeling dry but at the same time it isn't oily.I love how my face feels! I am amazed and can't stop touching it (but will). I love Essa products. The vita clarify cleansing lotion is so gentle. It not only cleans but makes my face feel soft and smooth. I jave not experienced any breakouts after using this product. I love the way it smells. I feel like it is very gentle on my skin while providing a good cleaning. Essa skin care products are very good for the price! OMG! i love this stuff i ended up buying another one to spare! I got this for my son who is 9 and starting to get some bumps here and there on his face, he used this and in instantly looked better, cleaner, healthier and in a  few days his bumps were mostly gone and less red! Comparing this to ACURE facial cleanser, I find it easier to lather and that a little goes a long way. My face feels very smooth and hydrated after use. I am very happy with the product and will be switching to their product. Love that it is a mostly organic product. Essa VitaClarify face wash smells fresh and leaves my face feeling clean and smooth. I have sensitive skin and have had no issue with this product. My skin in brighter and clearer. I've purchased Essa moisturizer as well and its amazing. Love this cleanser! The fresh, sleep futky earthy scent, the smooth sudsy consistently, & the way it removes my makeup. 2 thumbs up for sure if you like a nice lather. The quality is superior too- no parabens, sulfates, animal testing, etc. I've been using this face wash every morning now for a little over a week. It doesn't have a strong smell. Its nice and smooth. So far it has done me well and left my facing feeling clean and refreshed. I would consider buying this product again. My  girlfriend let me have the rest of her bottle so that I could try it out because she loved it so much. I could tell within days the difference I am so glad I finally got my hands on my own bottle I highly recommend this product!! I am very excited to have found this cleanser. My skin feels very clean and energized after using this face wash. As part of a complete skin care routine, I am seeing bright results and clear skin. I have a really sensitive face and this was fine to use! Left my face feeling great. This product is just wonderful. It is so smooth and leaves my skin feeling fresh. It has helped with reducing my pores. It has a very light smell which doesnt bother me at all. Would highly recommend. love this face wash! It smells so light and refreshing. It really feels like its getting into my skin and not just sitting on top moving around. It works really well with the vita refine too. Great combo! Love this facewash!  Such a beautiful scent and the tube has a feature that doesn't let you squeeze out more than you'd need - about a dimesworth... Love that.  Great product :) I have dry skin and just had a baby. My pregnancy mask is very obvious and I was excited to try the product. It has left my skin soft and hydrated! I no longer have to apply a second layer of moisturizer and I have started noticing my discoloration evening out. I will be purchasing this again. Great fragrance, mild cleanser I am using daily. Leaves my skin clean and does not dry it out. I like that a small amount of cleanser goes a long way. I'll purchase again. wonderful product. Thank you! Great product and I love that it is organic and does not contain harsh chemicals. I am really seeing a difference in my skin since I began using it. I really like this cleanser.  It leaves skin feeling clean, but not dry. It has a nice texture and pleasant citrusy scent that isn't too strong. Love this facial cleaner.  Refreshing and smooth. Doesn't leave your face dry like most other cleaners. So fast I'm impressed with this line of facial products. I received this awesome face wash yesterday and it's the best my face has ever felt. I've used it 3 times already and my face feels so refreshed. Very gentle yet effective facial cleanser with the BEST fragrance! Kind of a cross between watermelon and grapefruit. I love it! I absolutely love the smell and how creamy it is. I noticed how bright it makes my face look. Even though it is subtle it makes my face appear to have a natural glow. My face feels very soft after use. Was in need of a new facial cleanser and decided to try this one out. Seems to work well for my combination skin so far. Doesn't dry out my skin too much and keeps my skin balanced for the day. For those who care of what they put on their face and body... Great facial cleanser. Leaves my skin feeling clean, soft and smooth. Doesn't cause breakouts. My skin appear smoother healthier and more radiant. As a mother of five I am truly excited about this product. Vita Clarity will leave your face feeling so fresh and soft without the over drying you may have experienced from other facial cleansers. The smell is also very refreshing. This daily face wash smells so good! It was very smooth and easy to wash off. I love that it works for my sensitive skin, and doesn't leave my skin red. This VitaClarify is perfect for anyone who has sensitive skin and does not like strong smelling face washes. It smells good, but It is not overbearing. I also felt that my skin was NOT dried out after I used this.ESSA - VitaClarify - Premium Multi Vitamin Organic Facial Cleanser for Wrinkle and Skin Blemish Reduction and Anti Aging Support. (4 oz) I am obsessed with all 3 Essa skin care products! This cleanser very gentle unlike the store brands that make my skin dry and irritated. This cleanser cleans and moisturizes and keeps my skin feeling great all day. I always follow use with the vita-c-whip moisturizer and I definitely recommend these products to anyone.

B00O2BT8QU," Superb product! Love badger Rose Oil.  It smells wonderful my teenage daughter use it to wash her face too. Leaves my face clean and soft. No drying. Love i! A small amount does the job. Will definitely buy again. Pump dispenser on the bottle makes it easy to use just the right amount. I followed the directions on the bottle and spread evenly over my dry face, gently rubbing areas with concentrations of makeup (e.g., mascara), then rinsed with warm water. My face felt soft after, with a lovely, gentle scent. I will say I didn't realize there's also a rose version for my type skin (over 50, starting to wrinkle), which I will also purchase. Even so, my face feels quenched after using this product, not dried out like with other cleansers, even those that promise to moisturize. I love this cleansing oil!  My skin feels so soft and glowy after using it.  It doesn't clog pores or make my face more greasy (I live in a super humid climate) and it smells great.  I always think of it as a little spa treatment for my face every time I wash with Badger Cleansing Oil. Beautiful scent and easy to use. Makes my face glow I love this cleansing oil, removes makeup well and moisturizes. I unfortunately had to start using something else because of the price. I've been using this product for months and my skin has never been this nice. This is a great oil cleanser. I use it at night before my foam cleanser. It is clean, no scent, and really gentle on the face. I will continue to use it and recommend to others. Great product! I have dry skin and this works wonders! I use it at night, as it can be a bit oily for daytime use. Love this cleansing oil. I have never used this type of cleanser before and I am so pleased I tried it. It leaves my face clean and soft and does not cause blemishes (which I was concerned about) I will definitely continue to use this andI highly recommend it especially for sensitive skin. Love it!! Unbelievablely fantastic!!! I've used this for a few months now and love it. I first wash my face with Prescriptives Gel Cleanser to get off the eye makeup, then follow with this cleansing oil. I live in LA and the dry weather makes for dry skin. This oil rinses well but leaves my skin dewy and ready for BB cream. I have been using this product for over a year.  It removes my make up very well and I love how soft my skin is. Great for winter. Doesn't make me break out or feel greasy. Perfect for my sensitive skin. This product is wonderful. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to amp up their glow. Oil attract oil so adding a precleans step to your beauty routine will clean your face thoroughly. It makes you look radiant and makes the skin soft afterward. I also use another rose facial oil that I leave on my skin after washing. I will continue to use this oil. Love it! It has completely eliminated my black heads in the first week of use. My skin looks better than it has in a long time. Also love the way my skin feels post cleansing. Gentle, smells great, works flawlessly Love it gave my skin a 180 degree difference, my skin is brighter, complexion is more even, and even my acne is a little bit better ( i have disease related acne) Love It! Completely pure, wonderful smelling and moisturizes as it cleans.  Badger products are highly rated as safe and non-toxic and this cleansing oil is better than some I've paid more money for.  I will continue to use this. Love, love, love this product! This cleanser always leaves my skin feeling soft and gives it a nice glow. Super gentle for sensitive skin. A little goes a long way. Perfect cleanser for my skin. Love washing my face! I bought this on a bit of a whim and it has been my best skincare purchase ever! I'm never going back to regular cleanser!After getting fed up with clogged pores and the little bumps that come with that. After one day of using this cleansing oil, my skin seemed a little worse - more blemishes and the blackheads looked a bit more prominent. However, on the second day it cleared right up and my skin is better than it's ever been! I never thought my pores could be so clear of gunk! I can't believe what a difference this stuff has made.The only problem with it is it's a little hard to apply. Because it's very runny it goes everywhere when I pump it onto my fingers then put it on my face. I've started putting the pump right up to my cheek and pumping it right onto my face. It would be great if Badger could come up with a better design for this. Excellent product. Will order again. I had never tried oil cleansing prior to this purchase. I have medium-dry skin, and just moved from a very humid climate to a very arid one. I love Badger Damascus Rose Cleansing Oil. It really leaves my face feeling clean and supple. I still use moisturizer etc. when after I am done cleansing, but the cleansing oil doesn't leave me with the dry tightness effect of most other facial cleansers. Also, I was worried about the cleansing oil causing acne (I'm 34 and usually get an acne flare up once a month around my period), but this has not been the case. If anything, the cleansing oil is keeping my face clearer than my previous facial wash. It also lasts a long time. I use 4-5 pumps a day to cleanse, and have used about 3/4 of a bottle over the course of five weeks. This is a great item. I'm on my third bottle of this cleansing oil and I love it.  I have sensitive, mature, and acne-prone skin, so finding a good product that works and doesn't irritate is a challenge.  But this one does it and it's organic! Very useful and great product in a skin care.Arrived on time, with no problem at all.Highly recommended,Larisa V. Bought as a gift for someone who wanted to try this product and was told by the person that they really love it. Love this product. Keeps my super dry face from cracking and bleeding. The seller did awesome as well! This is a very effective, and yet safe, make up remover.  It clears eye shadow, foundation, and all others - I use a little sponge in the shower to remove the oil and washes my face with cleanser, and my face looks so clean! So glad I found this and the unscented cleansing oil. For the first time in years I don't have dry, flaky skin on my face! (Dry, sensitive skin). Love this cleansing oil. Leaves face soft -- no dryness at all. I love this oil.  It's not too heavy for my face so I don't break out.  I would definitely recommend using during the hot summer months as it leaves a nice glow and has a cooling effect on the skin. I have very dry skin so I love the product, my face doesn't feel so tight and dry when I wash it. And I like the smell and the very slight tingle you get from it Love this cleanser. It is light and smells delicious. One of the best and affordable oil cleansers out there. This product is great for my Minnesota dry winter skin. Normally I have rough, flaky, dry patches of skin on my face despite my best efforts. Not anymore. The oil has wonderful, good for you ingredients. It makes my skin glow. (I also use the Badger - Damascus Rose Face Oil afterwards.) I would highly recommend it for anyone who suffers from dry, parched skin. This is a quick cleanser for me to get my makeup off with after a long day at work. Leaves the skin soft and it smells good as well. I like the oils very much! I used to use DHC Cleaning Oil, but this one is most definitely going to be my new cleanser. It smells phenomenal,  I actually like that it does not foam when you apply  water to it. Using a soft cloth and warm water really helps to remove the make up and the oil, it leaves the skin feeling hydrated and after you pat you face dry and let it air dry for a minute or two you can apply toner and moisturizer as normal. Cleanses without stripping moisture from skin. Works great and I love the smell. seriously took five years off of the 40 year mom to a toddler who never sleeps! I actually really like this product, I was afraid it would make my skin greasy but it doesn't! Smells nice and is easy to use Skin feels great after I love the rose  cleanser and the seller is great! Love what it does to my face! I've been using this stuff for a while now, it's nice and has a pleasant scent! I love products of Badger. I would say that the nature takes care my skin. Fantastic product. Skin feel soft and clean. Very comfortable!!! Perfect I am happy Great product, leaves my skin clean and soft. Great buy Good My skin loves this so much it actually absorbs almost all of it while I'm massaging it into my skin. I love the smell and feel of this cleansing oil, it works as advertised and I use it at the end of the day to remove my makeup. However, the price is a bit steep. I'd be more likely to buy it regularly if it was cheaper, or came with more product Really good! Cleanses well.  Was the right thing for my chemo skin... lovely cleansing oil, smells great and feels good (and cleans also) I recently purchased this face cleansing oil along with the post-cleansing Badger Damascus Rose Face Oil for moisturizing. I cannot express how much I love these products! I have been using both products for about a month. My skin feels so much more clean and moisturized, really.I've also noticed I've had maybe only 2 small pimples in the entire month - much fewer than I've been experiencing previously. With spot treatment and no picking on my part, they went away quickly and never got out of hand. Easily covered with concealer. I think this may have also just been expected since starting this routine would by default start drawing impurities to the surface. I have struggled with hormonal adult acne on/off for the last several years. I've tried everything to help with it but struggled to find something to consistently kept the breakouts at bay. Several months ago, I read that oil facial cleansing can actually help eliminate acne due to how much better it cleanses the skin. Since the oil in the cleanser is attracted to the sebum in your skin, the impurities in your sebum are brought to the surface and wiped away with the oil cleanser and a warm face cloth. Just like we learned in science class, 'like attracts like'. I don't know what took me so long to connect these dots! My face feels DEEPLY cleansed when I'm done washing my face, and yet the process is much more gentle on your skin.Admittedly, I was skeptical and fearful the oil may break me out more. I tried using coconut oil as a cleanser before buying this product, but eventually noticed my skin was breaking out even worse. I did some additional research and read that coconut oil has excellent properties for the skin, but is more comodogenic than other oils. This oil cleanser has a variety of oils that I've read online are the best options for face cleansing. It does not contain coconut oil.  If you're worried about breakouts, don't be.Here's the routine I've been following:- Squirt 2-4 pumps of oil into my palms and rub the oil a bit in my palms before applying to my DRY face, neck, and chest area. How many pumps depends on how much makeup I wore and if I applied mascara that day. It removes mascara very easily, too.- Let the oil rest on your face while the water is warming up. Soak a wash cloth in pretty warm water. I've mostly been using these microfiber wash clothes I bought on Amazon. https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LWIINUS/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&th=1-Press the warm wash cloth over my entire face and hold there for several seconds. Then I proceed to wipe away the oil, taking care to rinse the cloth after a couple of wipes and then using the opposite side of the wash cloth afterwards to avoid re-applying a dirty part of the cloth if it can be avoided. I sometimes use the same washcloth at night and the next morning without trouble. I never re-use the same cloth more than twice before replacing.- Once I've rinsed clean, I splash cold water on my face to close my pores. Then pat (don't rub) dry.- I've been adding a drop of tea tree oil to a couple pumps of the post-cleansing rose face oil and massaging that into the cleansed areas. I figured if I were going to break out, at least the tea tree oil might help.  I then follow up with a nightly moisturizer (like Elta MD PM moisturizer). I just saw this same Badger brand sells a Beauty Balm that some people apply at night for extra moisturizing. I am going to order that since sometimes I do get a little eczema on my forehead, and the tea tree can be a little drying even when applied with the face oil. I've applied this same face oil and drop of tea tree oil in the morning before applying my daytime moisturizer (Elta MD AM moisturizer) and/or Elta's sunscreen. Elta MD products are great if you have acne prone skin. They use excellent ingredients that don't break skin out.The scent smells very nice. It's a light and natural rose scent...nothing synthetic. I don't know where this has been all my life. I'm so glad I started researching this and stumbled upon these products on Amazon! For reference, it's been a month and I still have about 1/4 the bottle of cleansing oil left and about 50% of the post-cleansing oil remaining in the original bottles.I hope this helps you in your decision! A very nice way to clean you sensitive face especially this year in New England's cold winter with tundra like temperatures. After I apply it, I will use a cotton square moist with warm water to remove it. My skin is dewy and  feels instantly soft. I don't wear almost any make up, so I cannot say how good it is to remove it, but just for the purpose of  the everyday face cleaning, it does an excellent job. I could also add that I chose this over over the Argan cleansing oil made by Badger because the Argan cleansing oil contains chamomile that makes my skin red and itchy. This is the BEST. I have acne prone skin; always have. I even get bad cystic acne. I've been using all kinds of products for years, including benzoyl proxide, salcylic acid and prescription medication. I've been oil cleansing with this Badger Rose cleanser for 2 weeks and my face has never been more clear. It sounds crazy but within 2 days I could see and feel a difference. It really does get into your pores to pull out all the dirt and oil that gives you acne. I'll admit it's a bit of a process to heat up the washcloth... But like the box says, it's part of a ritual to nurture yourself. I love it.I use kind of a lot, maybe 4-6 pumps. The bottle should last 2 months or so at that rate with 1x per night use.Worth noting also, this product arrived SO FAST! Like, the next day fast. It was a pleasant surprise since I was looking forward to starting my new cleansing experiment. Highly recommend all around. I love the scent. I use a nice steamy wash cloth to remove. I have adult cystic acne from PCOS and this has really helped soothe the sensitive acne, as well as heel up old breakouts, and fade the lingering red marks. I would say I have seen a 70% improvement in skin tone and texture. It has also helped clear up my black heads on my nose, on minimise my enlarged pores on my cheeks. I thought maybe it was the result of the B5 face serum I was using, but after stopping use for about 2 weeks (left my bottle at family home) and then resuming there was a marked difference. Maybe it's the combo of the two but this definitely does help. I used to buy separate oils and mix them to clean/ moisturize my face. I like this oil mixture and it cleans my face without making it oily. I just ordered more with the separate face oil because this doesn't moisturize like I need it to. This product does what out says and has refreshed my skin. I really like this oil.  I have dry skin (and I live in Utah, which has really dry air), and was looking for something that would both clean away my makeup, while also not drying out my skin further.  My skin doesn't feel moisturized after I use this (so I think this would probably be safe for people with oilier skin), but it doesn't feel dried out, either.  Moreover, this completely clears away my makeup.  I no longer have little raccoon eyes from mascara (which my last soap left behind).  This doesn't sting my eyes, either, and it smells good.  Additionally, I think this will last a very long time, as I've been using it every night for a few weeks now, and I've barely made a dent in it.  This is a great buy. Badger does it best. Low plastic packaging with organic high quality oils! This works. It does a fantastic job removing make up from my face, or just hydrating my skin while washing it. I'm chemically sensitive with many allergies, but this doesn't cause me any reactions. It's totally safe for me, and it works exceptionally well! I can't recommend it enough! I follow this up with a foaming cleanser, as well. Works greeeat. I have very sensitive skin and this makes my skin feel calm:) This oil is really nice! I've been looking for something to make my skin feel soft and hydrated and this is it! I use the Badger Damascus Rose Cleansing Oil followed by the Low pH Morning Gel Cleanser and then this lotion (all from Amazon and reasonably priced) and my skin feels awesome. I wore under makeup today with primer on one half of my face and not the other. The difference was barely noticeable. No caking. No breaking up. No oil slick. Overall really happy with this regimen and will continue to use. Nicely done. Love this stuff! Discovered it at sprouts and will never go back to normal soap cleanser for my face. The oil gets rid of makeup super easily. I use it in the shower instead of face wash and rinse it off after cleansing and it never leaves my skin oily after, but I have dry skin anyways. I usually use the badger face oil after as a moisturizer too. Since I've started using this I haven't broken out or had any pimples! This stuff smells great, is wonderful for taking off makeup and general face cleansing and it keeps my skin from losing moisture without breaking me out! I also love using it on my hands to soften when giving myself a manicure. It works wonders! This has drastically improved my rosacea symptoms. Less redness, less flaking, less itching and burning. My skin is smoother and softer than it has been in years! This product is, by far, the best on the market for cleansing my face. I'm a bit of a beauty junkie and I absolutely LOVE ALL Badger Balm Products.  They are a wonderful company and I support buying products MADE IN THE USA!  The quality it TOP NOTCH.  The oil cleanses my face beautifully and makes my skin feel soft and clean.  Badger Balm is a PHENOMENAL BRAND using ALL NATURAL ingredients.  If you haven't tried them yet, please order now.  You won't be sorry.  Quick shipping.  LOVE THIS! Love this facial cleansing oil. Had tried using coconut oil and other oils in the past and will never go back. Skin feels soft and I feel super fancy using this :) I trust Badger when it comes to putting products on your body and this is no exception. Although it says unscented, it still has an argan oil smell, just no added fragrance. I've never had any problems with the bottle or pump. I've read that you use 3-4 pumps of oil but I have to use around 8 or so to get all of my makeup off of my face. With using 8 pumps of it, it tends to get used up quickly. I wish they made a larger bottle. It doesn't strip my skin or leave a tight feeling, but I use my Cerave moisturizer after. I ran out of it and stopped using it for a while but I missed it so much I had to repurchase. Nothing removed the dirt and makeup quite like this cleanser. I would definitely recommend! Ever since starting the Oil Cleansing Method a year or more ago - I've been in love! I've used a couple other oil cleansers but I've seen the most improvements in my skin from the Badger line. This cleanser is gentle and very effective at removing makeup. It leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated rather than tight and dry like non-oil cleansers have in the past. The one warning is ... when using an oil cleanser to remove makeup ... if you use a washcloth to wipe the oil off your face it will become nearly impossible to get the makeup stains out of your washcloths. I've tried everything from baking soda, lemon, vinegar and my white washcloths will not come clean. Aside from that minor ""issue"" I'd highly recommend the Badger line! I started using this (and, previously, the unscented version) as a part of my double cleansing skin regime. This involves first using the oil, wiping it off with a warm wet paper towel, and then using my normal cleanser. This has been SUPER effective (more so than DHC's oil cleanser IMHO) in eating through my sunscreen so that my face wash can penetrate and clean my skin. The end result is that my skin tone has gotten very even and blackheads I had on my nose are visibly reduced. I bought it and let it sit for months without using it because I was skeptical of oil as a cleanser and now I'm on my second bottle. My skin has always been pretty good (been using sunscreen and vitamin C since my early 20s) but now that I'm in my late 30s it was starting to diminish. This product has really kicked my skin quality back into gear. Love this stuff. Try the rose facial oil too (not the cleanser, the leave on version). It's great as well! This product is amazing!! I use it everyday to wash my face and so far so good. It hasn’t broken me out and my face feels really smooth and moisturized after. I take my makeup off with it too when I wear any and it does a good job at getting all of it off! I’m African American with combination skin. Definitely would recommend this, I love it! 10/10 Just the product to kick off the Chiberian winter. My skins tends towards the dry side (I've been using grapeseed oil as a moisturizer for almost a year). Love this product, it smells wonderful and washes off easily with a washcloth (including makeup). Hopefully all that mascara comes off the washcloth in the washing machine, though! I think oil cleansers would be great for removing makeup. However as a normal cleanser for dry or sensitive skin I think there are better options. Cerav and cetophil are great. I used this oil once so far and it was nice. Smells like olive oil but is lighter and less oily. Rinsed off completely with a wet rag and left my skin feeling clean although a tad dry. But I'd rather be dry than oily. Overall nice organic cleanser. Makes my skin feel so soft, removes makeup and dirt, luxurious! Unclogs pores! I've been using this for about two weeks now along with the moisturizing face oil that compliments this. I can't say for sure that it has made me break out any less but it has certainly changed the feel of my skin. It looks and feels so much healthier than when I'm cycling between completely stripping my skin with harsh acne cleansers and then attempting to re-moisturize it with acne lotions. I definitely recommend anyone on the fence to try the OCM and see if their skin doesn't feel better almost immediately. I just recently started oil cleansing and I love it! I'm on week three, and this is the second oil cleanser I've tried. I started out with an impulse buy at my local Trader Joe's and I love their oil cleanser, but over the 2 weeks I used it I sprouted a few pimples (I think this is because one ogf the ingredients is coconut oil). I purchased the Seabuckthorn because it was specifically for acne (so it claims). This leaves my skin feeling soft and doesn't leave a residue. I use this at night and then use my regular moisturizer since I have skin that is prone to breaking out when I use new products. I will consider purchasing again when I am through with this, but it really depends on how long this lasts me. I was wanting to try the Tata Harper cleansing oil, but after looking at the price I searched for substitutes. THIS STUFF IS AMAZING! The menthol in it gives your skin a cool feeling so you know its being cleansed. Coming up on the cold weather I know this is going to keep my skin moisturized and hydrated and clean! I highly highly recommend this stuff! Thank you Badger!!!!"
B00DMK9QCI," It seem to work as what they says, tightening, firming, lifting, not oily nor dry your face. Definitely switch to this over High-end products don't see the differences as they promise! Love love love. This is my second time buying this product. Great product. I love the way it makes my skin looks and feels. This is very good product, it seems my skin cleared. I would say lighter than before. Great toner doesn't dry my face out. Brightens my skin bought for my girlfriend Good product . Very pleased with this product. I can see a difference in just a few weeks. I have loved all the products from this company makes my skin feel great This product met my expectations. I have used this product for a couple of weeks, which is not enough time to result in any fading; however, it really cleans and shrinks my pores which I am happy about. Love this toner. Was looking for a replacement for the discontinued Rodan & Fields spot fading toner.. only been using it a week & once a day, not twice, and my scars have faded. Have some really old acne scars that the complete unblemish system couldn't remove after 3 months of use have magically faded within a week. Costs a lot less too. Will definitely be buying again I have to say that I'm somewhat of a skincare junkie. I love to try new products all the time and I've used some great products as well as some not so great products. I just recently started using toner again after years of giving it up. I have recently started developing the beginning signs of sun spots and was looking for something to reverse them, or at least postpone any further damage.This toner really impressed me right away. It smells great and it doesn't seem to dry my skin like some other toners have in the past. I spread it over my face after cleansing, and then after it has dried, I apply the Whitederm fading concentrate. I have only been using this as part of my skincare routine for a few days, so I can't say how effective this toner will be in treating my dark spots (yet). I can, however, say that it makes my skin feel fresh and clean and gives it a dewy look and feel when used with the fading concentrate.I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, and I'm really glad I jumped at the opportunity. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a great product to add to their skincare regimen. If you are looking for help with uneven skin tone, give this a try.  This toner really helps with all types of uneven skin problems. If you have dark spots, age spots, sun marks, whatever you want to call them, this will help. I have 3 spots that I am not sure what they are. Just somewhat darkening areas. Since using this product, 1 of them is almost completely gone. The other 2 have really diminished. With as well as this product is working, I think I will be down to only 1 within the next week. This is just an awesome product,. It also tones and firms your skin while it is evening your skin tone. It is paraben free which is better for your skin. I did receive this item at a discounted price, in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. I love Mediderm products. This toner is now part of my daily routine. Many other toners I have used in the past are very astringent, they smell like rubbing alcohol and burn if I have any facial impurities. The WhiteDerm Fading Firming Toner is different. It has a wonderful smell, almost fruity. It goes on smooth and doesn't leave behind greasy skin, and it doesn't burn and dry my skin out! After using my face feels soft and clean and my skin smells amazing. I also feel it firming up my face. I use at least once per day, twice if I can remember to wash my face before I fall into bed at night. I am in love with this Toner!I received a discount on this in exchange for an honest and unbiased review and all opinions are based on my personal experience with the WhiteDerm Fading Firming Toner. I was at a spa to get IPL laser resurfacing to reduce redness. I had to sign a multitude of release forms and after research found some horror stories. So, I decided to at least try something topical before doing the laser, possibly causing permanent disastrous results, great results or doing nothing, as well as spending about $1,000. I have been happy with Mediderm exfoliator, so after reading good reviews, I decided to diligently use their system. It's only been a few weeks and I'm very happy thus far and have ditched the idea of the laser. I took pictures the day I was going to stat the treatments so I'm posting my ""before"" and how I look after a relitively short time, a few weeks. The before have a bit of eye makeup and I just took the afters, with no make-up. I use the sensitive skin foaming cleanser, whitederm fading firming toner, miracle night repair cream at night and microdermabrasion polish twice a week. Also, I just turned 50. For anyone considering laser, at least for redness, I highly recommend trying the Mediderm system first! As someone who suffers from adult cystic acne skin care is very important to me. I'm always looking for quality skin care products. I have several products from the MediDerm line and I truly love each and every one of them.The WhiteDerm Fading Firming Toner is a great addition to my nightly routine. I use this in the evening after washing my face. I use a round cotton pad and swipe all over my face. It removes all of the last traces of makeup. I love the clean fresh feeling without stinging or burning. I can see that  it's starting to fade the scars from my acne.It is a light aqua color so that you can see how much you're using on the cotton pad. It comes in a plastic bottle with a small hole to dispense after the cap is removed. I like this because if the bottle tips over it's not all going to spill out.I received this product for free or at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
B004LLTO6A," This product has made a real difference in my Rosacea. I am especially pleased with the way my eyes are feeling since starting Rosadyn. They don't burn as much and are not as red as before. I hope they continue to improve as I use the product. seems to help if you take regularly Helps reduce rosacea. Very pleased with this product. Helps regulae heat works with hypothalamus Work's really good on rosacea. I am taking several blood pressure medications, which are all vasodilators triggers for rosacea. I had redness, swelling, and pimples on my nose everyday, no matter what I did, I could not control the rosacea flare-ups. One day I was in the process of ordering prosacea gel which I had used in the past from Amazon, and Rosadyn was listed as a treatment for rosacea, so I decided to give it a try. After two days of treatment I immediately noticed a difference, I had less redness, and no new pimples. I have been taking Rosadyn for almost two months now, and I have not had anymore swelling, and very few pimples which mean almost no redness. I am grateful for Rosadyn, and will purchase this product for a daily regime. My doctor said it was okay to take rosadyn along with my blood pressure medication. I've been using Rosadyn for a month now and I've had no flare ups. It seems to be working for me I have seen a definite difference in the redness.  My eyes don't feel gritty.  My doctor had me on perscription medication but it would upset my stomach.  I have had no problems with Rosadyn upsetting my stomach.  I will continue to use this product. I wrote a review of Rosadyn six months ago, when I first started using it. This is a follow up to that review; in a nutshell: Rosadyn keeps its 5-star rating!I was diagnosed with rosacea in my late 30's -- about 15 years ago. My skin is not so terribly bad and my trusty tube of Noritate keeps it under control (extreme temps -- especially cold -- and occasional overzealous exfoliating are my triggers) but my eyes have been affected pretty badly. I've tried many things for my eyes, including several go-rounds on Restasis, and nothing has helped. (After initially using Visine, and realizing this only makes things worse -- due to the rebound effect -- I stopped using it many, many years ago.) Before finding Rosadyn, most days the whites of my eyes were kind of a dull pink and it made me look tired, and on a bad day my eyes were so embarrassingly red it looked like I had been smoking some pot. I have actually had acquaintances ask me if my eyes hurt (curiously, they don't, they just look really bad).Thankfully, my eyes are so much better, and amazingly, I saw the improvement within the first week of using the product. In the past, I might have enjoyed the rare day (maybe one day every four months or so) where I would wake up and my dry and sensitive blue eyes would look clear, but it usually didn't last long after I left my house. Since I started using Rosadyn, my eyes have looked much whiter and brighter, consistently everyday and all day. There is a small red blood vessel in the inner corner of each eye, but this is a huge, impressive improvement from what it was.I read on some rosacea forums that there is a bit of controversy around the doctor who developed this product, but then I was also seeing some people who were insisting it worked, so I decided to give it a go. Also, based on what I was reading, I wasn't expecting to see any results for at least a month.I am kind of like many rosacea sufferers in that I also have some stomach issues -- kind of a very mild IBS thing -- but I haven't noticed anything worse since I started taking this product. (I have read where some people do experience problems with Rosadyn, so I think maybe I am a bit unusual and lucky with this? I have taken it with food, and also on an empty stomach, with no ill effects whatsoever.) After the first week of taking Rosadyn, I was feeling encouraged because I was seeing some improvement but not experiencing any bad gastrointestinal issues, so I increased my dose to 2 pills in the morning and 1 in the afternoon.Now, my eyes are 99% clear, and my skin is glowing! In a business meeting a few months ago, I actually had someone I barely know make a comment about me ""glowing""; and I know it is in a good way (not glowing RED!) but clear eyes and clear skin and just looking healthy, rested and alert for a change. (I know this sounds weird, but my face also looks thinner -- don't think that could be possible, but maybe it is the effect of less inflammation.I am thrilled with this product. No, I am ecstatic with this product!!! I don't know why it works ... but it seems to work. Update 2017: I'm still using this product and just noticed this price decrease on Amazon, awesome! I am still a full-time RN and I don't take money or product compensation for any of my reviews on Amazon or anywhere else. In my opinion, health professionals shouldn't. This product works... but it takes time to work, so don't give up on it and take it regularly. Created by a scientist who suffers from Rosacea; I trust it and will continue to use it for life...hope it is never discontinued. I went up to 4 pills a day for a while, but tapered back down to two a day while supplementing with my old topical: sodium sulfacetamide 10% sulfur 5% lotion, which is a prescription. Between the two I have almost no flares, and my skin looks clear and pale and my eyes are very rarely dry, red or gritty. The topical works great, however my Rosacea is so severe I would have it on my arms and chest without Rosadyn, so the topical is no enough to treat that.Old review: This is a sincere review, the negative one claiming the positive reviews on this product are bogus is...bogus. I'm an RN, this is my real name, and this product worked very well for me. I've used Sodium Sulfacetamide 10% Sulfur 5% topical for 15 years and it really worked very, very well. Then the pharmaceutical industry in cahoots with the FDA tried to get it removed from the market...they wanted to offer more expensive products and make more money. It's what they do, and unfortunately the FDA basically works for them, not so much for us.Anyhow, I complained to the Justice Department about it, and suddenly one company put my favorite topical back on the market. I have no idea if that happened because I complained;  hopefully it happened because many citizens complained.Point is, in the meantime, my Rosacea worsened. I was desperate, and took a chance on this product. My Rosacea started ""spreading"" from my face, to my neck, to my chest and arms. My skin burned (like a sunburn) and I had papules everywhere. I started taking Rosadyn, and within 2 weeks I started seeing a difference. Within a month I would say my symptoms were minimal. My eyes are clear 95% of the time. Keep in mind, I still use the topical product I've used for years, but I've never used it on my arms, which have stopped flushing altogether. I suspect I'm a worse case scenario as far as Rosacea goes as most people never flush on their arms, but with Rosadyn and my topical, I'm nearly symptom free. I take 2 a day, but you can go up to 4. My only side effect was a mild headache for the first couple of weeks. Most people seem to report no side-effects at all. I bought it on the website, not on Amazon, though I do love Amazon. Never been to doctor, but it seems this is growing problem for me.  So I tried this after creams.  Fixed the problem after 1 week.  Month later, I cut back to 1 in the morning rather than 2.  I am happy!Update: I am very happy with this.  I take 1 in the morning. I am surprised at how my face looks now. Redness is almost gone completely & no bumps or pimples . I really like this product A LOT!  I had a major flareup of rosacea starting in February and it just would not come down. Metro cream was barely holding its own.  When spring hit and the pollen was higher than average, my face was on fire and painful but the occular rosacea was terrible.  I could not get the gritty, sandy feeling out of my eyes and no over-the-counter eye drop could touch it.  I am impressed because it was not long, about the 3rd or 4th day after starting Rosadyn with the recommended dose of one capsule twice a day, my eyes were back to normal AND my facial swelling with redness was coming back down to baseline.  I have used this for a month and love the result.  I also took it to my dermatologist appointment to show her and even she noticed how much more improved my face was after only 2 weeks of using this.  I cannot speak for all users.  This is my personal experience only. If you are at your wits end, Rosadyn is worth a try. I would recommend it to anyone suffering with rosacea, especially occular when there is no relief in sight--no pun intended. I am a 28 year old male. About a year and a half ago my rosacea suddenly progressed very rapidly. Not just with an increase in what people commonly mistake as acne, but also facial redness/swelling as well as ocular rosacea symtoms. Not to mention I have every damn flushing trigger there is- embarrassment/anxiety, anger, lack of sleep, warm temperature, very cold temperature, exercise, too much food, too little food, certain kinds of light, time of day, allergens like cleaning products or dust, shampoo, certain kinds of laundry soap, etc. It was getting difficult to maintain self esteem and confidence. If you have rosacea then you know what I'm talking about.  So I researched different ways of trying to deal with it since there is no cure and a lot of trial and error later found rosadyn on the internet.  OK, so here's my experience with rosadyn: Didnt see any improvement for 3 and a half weeks. Then over the next couple months started seeing the papules and pustules reduce, but most noticeable was my skin smoothing out, not looking oily and having a better texture.(I think partly due to the olive oil among other things in rosadyn) The swelling around my eyes, eyelids and face went down, along with an improvement in my digestion (I among many other rosaceans have poor digestion) Anyways, that was a nice plus especially because I didn't think rosadyn would do that much because my rosacea was in the advanced stage. My bigger reason for still taking this product (been about 6 months) is the help it as been with my triggers. I was so sensitive before the longest I could last before flushing in ANY normal temperatured room was 35 to 40 minutes. Turning bright red along with stinging sensations, swelling and heat in your face is no fun, let alone in a class room full of people. It has helped with all the various flushing triggers, I'm basically just not nearly as sensitive now.  I still have rosacea symptoms, just greatly reduced. I still make sure to wash everyday with anti bacterial soap, still very careful of the food I eat, still mindful of allergens. I still felt the need to give a five star rating because I remember how relieved I was when it started working, and how less stressed I am now because of it.[the only side effect I could tell happened to me was a little difficulty sleeping in the first month] Ever since I entered my 30s, I started facing a very peculiar facial problem. Though I had been suffering from the problem of acne since a long time, but its appearance had never been so harsh before. It was of late that the marks started becoming darker and reddish tone started developing on them. When I searched the net I came to know that it wasn't mere acne problem but a skin disease referred as Rosacea. The redness and swelling on my face was increasing tremendously, leading not only to physical discomfort but also social embarrassment.People used to see me and react as if I was suffering from a severe infectious skin problem. Not only this, I was also suffering from the other severe symptoms of this disease including insomnia, fluctuating temperature, lack of appetite, allergy, etc. I was tired of my dropping confidence and self esteem and started looking for effective remedies. Finally my research gave way and I found these capsules on the web named Rosadyn Rosacea Treatment. Reading the features and customer reviews, I ordered the product instantly and was supplied with a bottle of 60 capsules. Reading through the instructions about the product, I started the capsule intake accordingly. To be frank, initially in the first week I felt as if the product did nothing for me. I felt no change but actually change had begun inside, which wasn't visible in the first week. As I entered the next week, I could actually witness the changes. The swelling and redness on my face started reducing as so did the pustules. Most importantly, I could feel my skin smoothening out, my appetite normalizing, and insomnia vanishing. My digestion had improved and I was out of the cycle of fluctuating temperature. My self esteem has started boosting up again and I can now face the society with all the confidence. Rosadyn changed my life.  I had suffered from rosacea for many years.  Only the burning face.  Many things triggered this burning but mainly room temperatures and stress situations.  It was becoming worse and my face was so sensitive to touch, it felt like my skin was on fire. I had treatments from the Doctor that made NO DIFFERENCE WHATSOEVER!Then my husband went online and discovered ROSADYN!!!  It was not an instant fix but a gradual improvement over the first few months. I took one tablet in the morning and one at night.  For the past couple of years I have had no symptoms AT ALL and am now taking JUST ONE TABLEY DAILY!  I will be forever grateful to ROSADYN for giving me back my life.  THANKYOU :) I have been using Rosadyn for over 5 years and believe it helps my flushing, swelling and redness.  It’s not been a cure, but it definitely reduces my symptoms.  I know this because after being on Rosadyn for several months, I stopped taking it.  Within 24 to 48 hours, my flushing and burning increased dramatically.  I wasn’t sure why I had gotten so much worse, but my only change had been stopping Rosadyn, so I decided to restart it.  Within another 24 to 48 hours, I was much better and back to where I was prior to stopping.  Now I take a double dose daily - 2 in the morning and 2 in the evening.  If you have flushing and redness, I think it’s worth trying.  There is a money back guarantee, so nothing to lose.  I am glad I tried it and will continue to use Rosadyn. I've been using this for less than a week and I'm already seeing a huge improvement. I haven't felt this good about my complexion in a very long time. Even after only 2 days of use my mom saw me without my makeup on and commented on how much better my skin is looking. I'm seeing serious reduction in bumps on my cheeks and while I still have the rosiness its not as bright as it was before. Rosecea has been a confidence killer for me for years now and this is ready helping me feel better. Well worth the money. Excellent product for reducing Rosacea symptoms. I have been using Rosadyn for about 5 years and it has virtually cured my Rosacea. I've had rosacea since I can remember. I went through laser IPL with some success, but was not satisfied with the overall results. I am very happy with this product after 2 1/2 weeks of taking it. My redness is much better. I also have rosacea in my eyes and I have seen improvement there as well. The ingredients can upset your stomach if you take rosadyn on an empty stomach, but that's the only side effect I've experienced. Eating before I take the capsules cured that right away. Thank you. I use this along with the Rosadyn Rosacea Cream and I noticed a difference within a few days. I've been using both for over a month now and while I still have the occasional breakout, the difference is absolutely amazing. The acne associated with the rosacea has greatly reduced and most days I'm now acne and rosacea free. LOVE this product! This product has changed my life and I have been on it for years and could not imagine ever going off of it. Prior to starting the product, everything triggered my Rosacea from spicy foods, physical activities, alcohol, hot and cold weather, wind, etc.  I very rarely have any triggers now since being on Rosadyn and any that occur are minimal.  I have tried numerous other products with no results.  Again, I love this product and as a nurse, I would highly recommend Rosadyn.  Diane I have posted this on another link as well, I just hope people who are searching for a way to help themselves or someone they love gives this a try... It truly does work, and quite quickly for my daughter (unbelievable results started after 1 week...she still continues to take it)  My daughter has suffered with this angry rash, inflamed irritated type acne for 4 years...this is the only product that has truly made a difference...she was put on birth control for a year, which doctors said would help and it didn't do a thing)  I also have her wash her face with Candida soap..another great find I stumbled on...figured it was a good idea to treat her inside and out..and she loves it..it has a nice smell to It which I think is the teatree in it...  yes, she still has acne she is working on clearing but the rash IS GONE and the inflammation. Proactive made it worse and so did some other over the counter products.. I truly encourage people to try this for a month..one pill twice a day...and consider cleansing with the Candida freedom if your skin dries quickly from other acne face washes...lol my daughter says this soap makes her face feel squeaky clean.  thank u I am now on my second bottle of Rosadyn. After about three weeks on the first bottle, I noticed that the bumps on my nose are almost flat.  I played a round of golf in the sun, which would normally make a mess out of my face, and I did get a little red, but it cleared up in a day and no bumps on my nose.  I have suffered with rosacea all my life, and this is the first thing that has calmed my face down aside from antibiotics.  I will leave more reviews as I keep using Rosadyn to show my progress, which looks like it's going to be very good.  The delivery of the item was quick, which helped me not to miss a dose.  I'll keep you posted! by Linda M on Feb 3, 2016If you are reading a review for this product, you are looking for help.  I first read Dr. Geoffrey Nase book, ""Beating Rosacea "", over 10 year ago, and his tips greatly helped my rosacea, so when Rosadyn came on the market about 5 years ago, I jumped at the chance to try it.  I have been a loyal customer for over 5 years now. This product does help with redness, breakouts, and eye problems. Give it a try and some time to see results. I also use Avene redness relief Dermo-cleansing milk and Nucelle 1 Mandelic wash as gentle cleansers. good-luck. This absolutely works - gets rid of the redness and dries up any pustules that may have appeared. I don't have many attacks because I'm pretty careful with diet, etc., but this is a staple in my medicine cabinet. At the very first sign of a breakout I use it and, as I said, it absolutely works. Product is First Rate. The ingredients attack my broken capillaries and redness of the face. I am now pale again with a normal complexion. Thanks Rosadyn! It works well. I have less flare ups I have been using Rosadyn for three years with great long term results. The redness and flushing on my face has gone as have the pustules I would get on my nose. The alternative was long courses of prescription medication that I wasn't comfortable taking long term. I lost some weight which I also contribute to the overall improvement of my skin. So far so good, I'll keep taking Rosadyn while I keep seeing an improvement. This is my second month taking Rosalyn and I very happy with the results. My skin is less red and clear and my eyes are also less gritty feeling and red. I will definitely continue to use this product. For me it is number one treating rosacea, I added Maqui berry for rosacea dry eye despite it had it as an ingredient . finally this monster is under control rosacea is not just a skin condition it robs you of your confidence and in extreme cases your looks and eyesight  i started taking rosadyn about 3 months ago and within one week i saw improvement and my right eye cleared up it was always itchy and tearing i take rosadyn along with flax seed oil and vitamin a the results were great i know its a bit pticey but compared to what we spent on doctors and creams that didnt really work it was a bargain im on my third bottle now and i take them every other day and i still am free of rosacea im going to research proper nutrition and see how i can keep these great results my face is clear and healthy im not scratching and continually rinsing it off i would tell anyone with rosacea to try rosadyn for a full month and see how it helps My son was diagnosed with occular rosacea when he was 5. He suffered terribly with it. His eyes would swell up and be very inflamed and he could not bear to have any light in his eyes. He would hide under covers in a dark room and still the pain was unbearable. His eye doctors offered only antibiotics and steroids-neither of which helped and in fact, seemed to make it worse. When he tried Rosadyn for the first time, it was like a miracle cure. His eyes cleared right up and he has not had any flare-ups in a long time. We are so thankful for this amazing product. Powerful, yet safe enough that a 7-year-old can take it with no problems at all. Love, love, love Rosadyn! I Have been using Rosadyn for a while now its great! Definitely notice a difference when I don't take Rosadyn! I recommend it . Excellent product! I've used Rosadyn for 6 months and have noticed a dramatic reduction in rosacea symptoms. Actually noticed improvement within two days of using this product. Highly recommended and would definitely give it a try. Been taking Rosadyn for about a month and do notice a pretty big improvement in my nose, (very red). Going to keep using.  My cheeks also seem better, not so hot all the time. Awesome product wife has not had any flushing since taking the pills. I have had rosacea for over 20 years with breakouts ranging from mild to severe.  Four years ago I found Rosadyn and I am so happy I did!  The rosacea on my nose was severe:  bright red and covered in bumps.  I started with the recommended dose (2 capsules per day).  A noticeable difference occurred within a month; in 2 months the redness and bumps were gone.  Gone for good!  Currently, take 1 capsule per day.  I am no longer embarrassed with my skin.  In fact, I feel confident enough to leave the house without makeup!  If you have a severe case of rosacea, be patient.  It's also important to have a diligent cleansing routine. I want to leave a good review as I found out after trying this for 2 months as a last ditch effort before seeing a dermatologist that I do not have rosacea I self-diagnosed myself because I had all the symptoms.Turns out I had seborrheic dermatitis in the same place rosacea normally occurs - I have been on a prescribed ointment for 1 week and it has cleared up 90%. Rosadyn did nothing for seborrheic dermatitis. Just FYI. It works.  You have flexibility with dosage.  Begin with recommendation.  Some severe cases may need 2 caps twice a day for a time. It is an excellent product, it was recommended by a friend and and seen results in the redness diminished enough. I am very happy with your purchase. This supplement is very effective.  My redness has reduced to barely visible.  Caffeine and wine do not cause flare ups now and people have commented that my rosacea seems to have disappeared.  I continue to take one supplement every day and I have been taking Rosadyn for approximately 3 years.  The other bonus is I rarely catch colds or get sick which I think has to do with the zinc in the supplement.  I highly recommend this product. I've been taking this for about 18 months.  It actually works. I've had moderate rosacea for 7-8 years. Lots of flushing and permanent redness. This product helped with both issues and I've tried numerous other products.  Just be consistent and give it at least a month before making any determination of effectiveness .  Also, be sure to take the capsules with plenty of water . This stuff is real good i have used rosadyn for a number of years now and love it. It keeps my skin looking and feeling normal, which is awesome. I still flush every so often but it goes away a lot quicker now. It seems to keep everything calm. I'm using Rosadyne since 2008, and it prooved to be the only side-effect-free ""treatment"" for facial rosacea. Taken for 2-3 weeks in intervals helps to control flushes and redness, most of the spots have cleared and some of them vanished completely. For me it's perfect for rosacea Control.Chris My daughter has rosacea i have been using this product since December 2012 and i have seen a remarkable difference in the redness on her face. I am very pleased with this product i believe it really works. Excellent product. I had tried many other products for my roscacea. This by far works the best. I will continue to use this product. I have been taking Rosadyn for Rosacea for at least 2 years. I have experienced some decrease in my facial redness. I'm also menopausal and my derm seems to think some of  my flushing is hormone related. I've had no bad side effects from the Rosadyn. Give it a try. All my life I've dealt with facial flushing and redness.  I've tried weird diets, IPL lazer treatment,  wearing tons of sunscreen, etc, but nothing would stop my face from flushing.  It got so bad that I would sit in my room and often cry, just because of how embarrassed I was.  I could't help it, and yet there it was for the world to see.  Everyone I knew would ask me ""Why is your face red?"".  I'd notice people in public looking at me strangely, or kids pointing at my face.  It was awful.  I was clinically diagnosed with depression at the age of 16, and even considered suicide at multiple points in my life.Then I decided to give Rosadyn a shot.I can honestly say that Rosadyn is the best thing that has happened in my life.  Every day seems to get better for my facial redness.  It's still slightly red, but the flushing has stopped dramatically.  I no longer flush if I am slightly embarrassed, or if ate something weird (often times carbs make my face flush). I feel that I can attend social events, not worrying if my face will flush.  Give Rosadyn a shot, I promise it's worth it.  You will NOT be disappointed.  Rosadyn has completely changed my life for the better, and I only wish I knew about it sooner. I have been suffering from facial flushing for some time now and it has become extremely embarrassing.  I started using Rosadyn several months ago and at first I was only taking 2 capsules a day (for the first bottle) and did not notice much improvement.  However, 4 weeks ago I increased to 4 a day (2 with breakfast and 2 with dinner) and I have seen a steady gradual improvement and definitely will keep taking it.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who suffers from some form of rosacea.  Karen Customer service was great when the postal service slightly damaged the product. (no problem with the packaging or the package itself. It was just the mail service)Customer service was responsive, and helpful. I have been using the product for about three weeks and have seen an improvement. So I did change a couple other things as well, with diet, and exercise, and my shampoo.. but I have been seeing a better reduction in red. So I would say this product works as described ( assumnig all other changes are placebos) I have been taking Rosadyn  for at least 1 year. Redness has calmed down, red spots around my face is much less, i still have rosacea but is much,much better. Very good thank you"
B008HCVFIE," Bought these for my niece to use after her running practice. She loves them These are perfect for me. They have just enough cleanser and texture to remove make up quickly. Strong enough to rinse with! I love these clothes. Yes, they are a little pricey, but they are worth it! I use these because I'm too lazy to wash off my make-up most days. It's crazy how easily these cloths will remove your make-up. I can see an improvement in my skin. I was using Neutrogena's make-up remover cloths before, but I found that they left a greasy residue on my face. With these cleansing cloths, my face just feels refreshed and clean. However, I must add that I use a toner afterwards just to ensure that I've removed all of make-up. Purity is THE best makeup remover bar none out there. To have it in this form for easy removal when you get him late, stupendous !!! Love my Philosophy family. These cloths take ""Purity made Simple"" and make it even simpler to use.  Make up just melts off. I love these wipes. I use the purity cleanser every day, so these wipes are perfect when I travel. The best facial wipes out there. Cheaper online than ulta perfect for when I am too lazy to wash my face! Arrived in good condition. These are awesome especially for travel or you're just too tired to get out your sonicare I have tried wipes. I have tried the so called non allergic made with natural face cloths. About ready to give up. My face was not tolerating other products. These are the best! My skin likes them and they are handy for hands etc as well as face. Worth every penny. First off, Philosophy always makes a great product and this one is no different. I love this better than the neutrogenia ones that i use. When I get off work, sometimes I am too lazy to remove my makeup so these work well.  I swipe my face a few times with one wipe and moisturizer when I am done. Its the lazy girl make up removal. Takes all my makeup off, quick, easy. Leaves skin feeling moist Purity Made Simple is the best facial cleanser of all time and now they have wipes. I mostly use these when I travel, but you could use them everyday if you wanted. They really clean without removing all the oil which makes your skin create more. Takes off all makeup beautifully and gently. Even eye makeup. Can't recommend enough. I love Philosophy Purity cleanser, and these are great for on the go.  A big bonus is that it's not a liquid, so you can throw this in your toiletry kit without worrying that you will wind up with liquid all over your hairbrush and mascara. A staple for me...have it on the auto shipment plan....Usually rip in half-just as efficient.WORTH the money-especially when you rip in half. Just love these wipes, especially when I travel! LOVE THIS. It feels so good. It smells good. It cleans so much with just one swipe. Best wipes ever!Makes skin soft and glow. If you try only one make up wipe then choose these. My skin is very sensitive and is oily/combination/blemish prone and these work for me just fine. No irritation at all. I love these! Great product! I could see a difference even after a few days. My husband is using it as well and though he won't admit that he loves it, he does. I know because he uses it without being reminded. Best on the go cleansing cloths.  Gets all my make-up off and my face feels like I washed it with a cleanser and water.  The smell is fresh and clean but not perfumey. I have used Philosophy Purity Made Simple Cleansing Lotion for years and was really glad to see them in cleansing towels. I  love them. Same great quality in a simpler to use version. Love these for taking off my makeup. Only face wash that does not break me out Item is a great product, I plan to buy more of them. These facial clothes are a great product. They are very efficient and should be added to your skin care routine. Great packing with easy pull out dispenser. I only use sensitive skin products. This works wonderfully. It has only a slight fragrance, and removes makeup with a few wipes of one cloth. I also use it to clean behind and in ears instead of q-tips. I love these cloths. They clean so nicely and my skin feels so good after using. I originally bought them for when I travel but now I also use them every day at home. I love the whole purity line. As you wash your face they don't dry out in the middle so one will last you through washing your face and neck and they're super gentle Good stuff, great prices. Sometimes when it comes to washing my face I get tired because of all the steps. So this is a lifesaver. Smells just like the original bottled soap. They do not break me out so even more of a plus. Removes eye and facial make-up with ease without burning or greasy residue. Will buy again. I don't use them every day.  I do use them almost every other day.  They really do an amazing job.  Cleans gently enough to prevent pimples from popping up from skin that's too clean. I've tried so many face wipes and face washes. I do not have acne, but I have sensitive skin, and just needed a makeup remover that did not leave me feeling greasy, or that I had to scrub my face till it was red. These are awesome. Purity Made Simple made simpler. The cloths are ample and one cloth cleans your whole face. Removes eye makeup including water proof  mascara without burning or stinging your eyes. Great for travelling. Love, love, love these wipes.  They do their job.  Wish they were not so expensive.  Sometimes they arrive a little bit dry but they still remove product very well from my eyes.  Recommend highly. Sometimes you get in bed, get all comfy and realize you forget to wash your face before bed. These are perfect to leave in a bedside drawer for just such lazy moments. I have been a Purity fan for years. I'm so glad they finally made these in a cloth. I would say that the cloths don't really cleanse as well as using Purity with my clarisonic, but they definitely clean off my make up and make my face ready for moisturizer. These wipes are great for removing ALL makeup. Even eye makeup. They are not too strong and great to have handy. I bought this for traveling, to avoid the liquids.  It seemed to work pretty well.  I ended up needing to use 2 wipes to remove all my makeup, but Purity works great! Great for emergency touch-ups or pick-me-ups.  Handy anywhere.  They are not drying and have a pleasant fragrance on the skin Convenient for travel I love these and they are definitely worth the price. Sometimes I feel like washing my face off early in the day, but don't want to go through my whole face washing routine until I lay down to sleep. These are perfect for that. I also have pretty oily skin and I like to wash it first thing in the morning, but if my morning routine with the kids keeps me from doing that, then I grab one of these and it tides me over until I can get to it. Love these. I will continue to purchase them as they have become one of my must-haves! Work well for my mother in law in a nursing home.  She has very sensitive skin and she loves them Arrived quick and works great on my skin, takes the make up right off. Great product highly recommended for make up removal :) really like these cleansing cloths.  don't make my skin feel tight after using.  will order again Great alternative to washing face with cleanser and water when needed. Clean feel and not harsh. My wife uses them every day and has for several years.She swears by them. I am a huge fan of philosophy products I've been using their skin care line religiously for years. I love these cloths especially when I'm traveling and don't want to pack the cleansers!  These work great! i love philosophy products. My favorite cleansing cloth! Again Philosophy is the best  face cleanser. I use the liquid Philosophy and I use cleaning cloths when I travel and they are fabulous! If you use their face soap you will love these face wipes for lazy nights or traveling. I swear by these!  I use them everyday & they are perfect for traveling! I love these face wipes! My face tends to breakout at the slightest irritation, but these are wonderful and part of my daily routine. Wonderful smell and very high quality! It gives a clean fresh look to the skin.A wonderful product. Love them! The only wipes that leave my skin feeling clean and moisturized These are very nice. If you like Purity or other Philosopy products you will like this. It doesn't smell strongly, the bottle of soap sometimes does. best make up remover, easy to travel with An easy way to cleanse my face. Doesn't break my daughter out. Works well My fiancé loves them. I LOVE this product. It's great to use at night when your so exhausted and want to do a quick wash. The cleansing cloths are great... Philosophy has great products... Amazon has great prices...Thanks so much!!! Buy this product with no worries at all!! So convenient for travel! Cannot express how awesome these are...amazing at melting stubborn mascara and taking it away! A+++++ Love it.  Fast ship One of my favorite Philosophy products next to the Purity cleanser. They work better than most of the wipes I've tried. I really like these facial cleansing cloths. nice product. Have use these for years and was very happy to replenish My favorite makeup wipes I love all of Philosophy's products, so when these came out, I had to try them. I have to say I was not disappointed. These wipes are not only convenient and easy to use, but they take EVERY BIT of makeup off of my face- even waterproof mascara-easily. After using these wipes, my face feels super clean, fresh, and soft. I have used cleaning wipes in the past that have dried out my skin and made my face feel tight and irritated. These wipes actually seem to ADD moisture to my skin.Another great thing about these wipes is the price- $15.00 is actually reasonable considering the quality. I will keep buying! Ok The best and easiest facial wipes Great makeup remover. Works well to remove makeup including waterproof mascara. Great face wipes. fine Removes the makeup really well including eye makeup. The best facial wipes...love!!! Great product! Love using these - Keeps face fresh and clean So happy to see this product online because I live in a rural area and can't find it.  Very happy with the entire ordering process. They are face wipes... They work. Not sure what else to say about them! Not sure what else to say about them. Ease at the end if the day- perfect removal every time. One handed - so being a mom and having clean skin work! I love the Philosophy products, but this is probably my favorite. It makes my face feel so clean and fresh. Now I sound like a commercial. LOL Very Nice Really good! I am satisfy with this order VERY GOOD CLEANSER, HOPE IT HAD MORE FOR THE PRICE, IT TAKES ALL THE MAKEUP OFF YOUR FACE, WILL BUY IT AGAIN. i love to camp and these are great to take along, fits better in my bag. i use liquid purity on my face every day- nothing else!! My absolute favorite ""go to"" facial wipe.  They smell amazing.  It's like I just had a facial.  :)  I even have these on auto-ship! These cleansing towels are great for sensitive skin; they remove makeup very well. these cloths work really well! I am a Philosophy girl through and through.  I cleanse with purity every night, and micro delivery every morning.  So when I saw these, I had to have them.  The price made me hesitate, and it took me about a month to make the purchase, but I'm glad I did.  I used it for the first time last night because I was dead tired and couldn't even lift my arms to wash my face.  Now, not a night goes by that I don't slather on hope in a jar.  I didn't do that after using the cloth (I honestly just forgot because I was so tired).  My skin did not feel dry and tight like with other cloths.  When I woke up my skin was soft and smooth.  And ordering from Amazon with Prime is nice because ordering anywhere else the shipping is ridiculous.  Try these, you won't be disappointed!! I love these. I have very oily skin and am constantly trying things to keep my acne under control. I was using the Purity face wash line for a few months (I just ran out and I would buy more, but they're just so expensive! However, I recommend the rest of the line for oily skinned people like me) and noticed a remarkable improvement in my acne situation. I still have breakouts in my most oily zones (my forehead, around my nose, and above my lip), but this definitely helps keep them under control. When I remove my make-up it doesn't clog my pores. My face does feel a tad bit damp after using it, but I just use one or two blotting papers before bed and don't have to worry about sleeping with a greasy face. I even use this on days where I don't wear make-up and just want a clean face after working. The only complaint I have is that I don't have overly sensitive skin and sometimes the wipes irritate my skin but I'm not sure what ingredient causes the irritation. THESE ARE A GREAT ALTERNATIVE WHEN YOU ARE TOO TIRED TO GO THROUGH YOUR DAILY SKIN ROUTINE AT NIGHT.THEY SEEM TO CLEAN AS WELL AS THE PURITY LIQUID WASH. THE MICRODELIVERY EXFOLIATOR COMPLETES MY FULL DAILY SKIN REGIMEN AND IT WALL WORKS GREAT FOR ME. I AM 70 YRS OLD.. Absolutely love these Purity Cleansing Cloths for traveling purposes. At home I use Purity liquid but these are so much more convenient.  Remove dirt, makeup, grime and make your face feel clean and refreshed.  Best of all works well for face and eyes too. I'd already fallen in love w/Purity MS in the bottle.  Really does smooth and even your complexion, and minimizes pores.  The pore improvement is actually pretty dramatic, even though the product is very gentle and never irritates.  Handy as heck while traveling, or when you are too tired to even run the water.  I always have some around. I have tried MANY different moistened facial cleansing cloths but these take the cake! These are fantastic! They are large and not thin at all! They left my skin clean without any dry feeling. Just the right amount of some moisture, perfectly done philosophy!! My product for life!Thank you! I have used the liquid Purity for years, and recently picked these up after I broke my wrist.  It's so great to be able to wash my face with Purity and have the convenience of a towelette with use of only one hand.  Thank you! I use Purity cleanser every night and have for about 8 years or so. But there are always those nights when you come home late and are too tired to do a good cleansing. These are the best!! Skin always looks brighter and softer the next morning. My skin can get irritated easily but never with these. Just wish they were not this expensive. However I will always have these on hand. Love them!! I love the way these make it easy to wash face when you don't wanna take the time to do yournormal wash. I also love how easy it is to wash the eye makeup off. I will get again. The best product I have ever used. So convenient to keep in my desk or take while I am traveling. item exactly as described great quality fast ship I love these to take off my makeup! Expensive but great for when I forget to wash my face before bed. Love these! love it"
B01N3YXXGC," This is the best soap ever! It cleans & softens my  skin without drying it out. If you have a problem with acne, put a thin coat on the area & let dry. Then simply wash it off. I really think you will be surprised, I was. I use it along with other soap and love it. Very happy with this soap. I've been having trouble with winter skin that leaves a psoriasis type rash and haven't been able to find anything to give me relief. I'm talking burning itchy skin that cracks when you stretch, right around the bra line. It was so bad I wasn't to sure that it wasn't something else! This soap has been amazing and within a couple days using it, cleared it right up. Combining with lots of lotion, I can now move freely. Also working great for my daughter, who has the same issues. I've been looking for the convenience of black soap in liquid form and here it is!!!  i've been telling family and friends about it andwill be a repeat consumer.  THANK YOU!!!1 Excellent customer service My order came very quickly and when I re-ordered it came even quicker .  I have extremely bad psoriasis and dandruff on my scalp and the liquid African black soap is helping.  My fingers are crossed that I can keep this condition under control with the use of this soap . Would definitely recommend trying it and ordering from rise n  shine As someone with eczema as well as super combination skin AND acne, it's incredibly difficult to find soap that can help all those factors at once.This soap has helped me clear my skin without harsh products and leaves me fresh and clean. I highly recommend it to anyone that faces those issues or just wants a good soap! Very nice,personable,service. Nice soft feeling soap. A very cheery,quality control employee,helped me get a replacement,after leakage,issue. The second delivery,was sealed well...and free. This is wonderful soap. I brought it to help my son's skin and I'm using it myself because it's a very gentle soap that doesn't dry out my skin. I had a small irritation on my face that I just couldn't get rid of and so I used this Black soap and it was gone within a week. My son has seen good results also. I would recommend this soap and will purchase again. Seems to help my adolescent daughter's problematic skin, thus rebuilding her self-confidence. Smells heavenly and defines her long hair with natural curls. Customer service is the BEST I have experienced so far. It seems to be working. I have only used a couple of times. It does stop my itch in eczema. This product is awesome!! i usually use a bar soap but this is less messy and it has a nice rich lather. I have been using African Black Soap for about 2 weeks now.  I was surprised to see that a black liquid soap like this lathered beautifully. I was also surprised that this black soap left my skin soft and not tight feeling or dry.  It was smooth and soft and not itchy at all.  Over the years I have tried every soap out there and honestly this soap is the only one that hasn't dried out my skin.  I would recommend this soap to friends and family. I feel the longer I use it the better my skin will feel. Love it Arrived quickly and just as described. Like other reviewers have said, the soap does come out runny. A little goes a long way though. It does lather up rather well. I have hormonal acne,,,,uuuughh and thought I would try this soap. At first it was making my skin break out for the  first few days then it cleared up almost completely within the first week. It can be slightly drying so make sure to use a good lotion after and one that will not clog pores. I was using a different brand which was purchased by my daughter as a gift from a local vendor made without coconut oil,it burned my face and dried my skin like a chemical peel.I actually bought this brand for my daughter since she swears by the liquid black soap and her skin tends to run on the oily side. Being it was on sale I decided to try it because I noticed it was made with coconut oil and shea not just shea,to my surprise it was soft and didn't burn my sensitive dry skin, it also didn't smell as bad.Also had a problem with my shipment being damaged I called Rise'N Shine and the customer service was top notch.I will be ordering from them again! Great stuff. Smells good and gets me clean. A little runny but still a little goes a long way. It is weird to see such a dark colored soap but doesn't stain skin or anything. Not harsh on skin at all. I have combination skin and it works really well for me. Would absolutely buy again."
B006ARO19S," Light I have ultra-sensitive skin, yet I'm prone to breakouts (not fair, I know) and this is one of very few cleansers I feel great about. It never dries out my skin and it feels more or less squeaky clean when I'm done. My skin hasn't had many breakouts since I started using it though I will say it hasn't seem to cut down much on blackheads (noting ever has for me except facials). I also enjoy that it's a foam - personal preference but it's a little different than what I'm used to. Highly recommended. Gentle face wash for my sensitive skin. One of the best I've ever used. Fabulous cleanser obsessed! it's so light and foamy and I love the scent! its very gentle! I buy 2 at a time when I purchase this cleanser. I love it and would not be happy if I ran out of it.  I love Oridel products! I makes your skin perfectly smooth and it smells good. I really love this foaming face wash.  I will definitely order it again. It is a quality product! l love this cleanser -  in one step it removes my make up and leaves my skin clean and fresh. I really can't say enough great things about this cleanser.  I've been using it for a long time now (before it was even available on amazon) and its one thing i can't live without!  The light foaming bubbles feel great on my face.  Its tough enough to clean and remove all my make-up without being harsh and overly drying.  When i run out and have to use something else temporarily I am always reminded how other cleansers just don't stack up against this one.  Yes, love it! This cleanser smells divine and has a wonderful texture. It takes off my makeup easily, does not irritate my extremely sensitive eyes as other cleansers do (if I manage to get even a tiny bit near them.)  It is a pleasure to use as you don't need to rinse and rinse to remove it. Another top product from an exquiste line of products. You can't go wrong with any of their line as all their claims happen to be true. A minor miracle in the hyperbolic world of skincare marketing. Removes all traces of make-up without drying. I need to get a second one since my kids love to use it after sports to remove oil and dirt and prevent acne flare ups."
B074TW5869," happy that the brush comes with for application - okay scent. Been using for 2 months. Skin feels soft and clean all the time Wife loved it and the brush was a handy add on Awesome mud mask! Great product This left my face feeling soft and left it without clogged pores. Does what it says it does for your skin. Once I run out I will be buying more! Love it WOW! Unlike any other products I found, Venu Dead Sea Mud Mask is totally natural, gentle, and hypoallergenic. Finally, there is a line of products that meets my skin type.This will make your skin Glow immediately after the first use! And not to mention soo AFFORDABLE! Thank you Venu!” Great brand and product. I love all their stuff. I have several masks and scrubs from them.  Just can't pick a favorite. I have ultra sensitive skin, and no hives, breakouts, or allergic reactions. So always a bonus. This is the best mask ever, I use it every night and my face has gotten very clear of spots. I will use it the entire month to see the change. As it has a lot of salt it can get itchy but is better to take it off before that. After just one application, I can honestly say I'm impressed. I had a few pimples trying to emerge, yet after applying this mask they just went away. I will be honest, as the mud was drying and becoming quite tight on my skin, it kinda freaked me out! Ha  Next time I'll know what to expect, so it'll be more relaxing. Will say...my kitten was extremely baffled with my  green face! She kept, with caution, wanting to smell and lick the mud!! I feel really good using this organic mask on my skin, which can be quite sensitive, and recommend it. Easy to apply and leaves my skin feeling refreshed! I have used just about all of this since I purchased. I will be ordered another! Scent is pleasant and not to strong, goes on smoothly with the brush that is provided and leave your face feeling soft and really clean. Brushes on easy, leaves my face feeling clean and smooth. Smells like mud, not perfume which I prefer Love this! Feels so good on and love that it  comes with the brush to apply. This mask is a great quality for the price. It goes on smoothly and feels great. Love this product! The entire line is high quality and such a great value. The brush that comes along works great for mess free and even application. Makes my skin feel great! Im on my boyfriends account but wanted to leave a review. After one application my face felt so soft. Everyone noticed a difference in my skin and asked what I used. It does smell a little weird but nothing unbearable, and it does burn a little bit but didn't leave my skin red or irritated after washing it off. My pores shrunk and I have less blackheads and hopefully will lessen even more with each use. I will definitely buy this again when I run out! This is the best mud mask I have ever used. It is very thick and makes my skin so soft and the price is great. Omg!!! Amazing!!!This literally made my skin feel like I just had a facial at the spa! I can’t wait to try some of the other things in your Venu store.Thanks again! Leaves my face feeling really soft. And I love the brush that comes with it, because I don't have to dirty my hands! Love the way this makes my face feel and look. This mask makes my face feel amazing! I just got this like 3 days ago and i have used it 2 times. The first time i could see a difference in my face. Like while i was at work it wasnt so oily. After you put it on and then wipe it off you can see a difference in your skin and your pores. I would recommend it. The mud mask just came. Looks like it will be very hydrating and moistening.  Looks very natural."
B00KZ225VA," Great, but gentle facial scrub. This was one of my first purchases with Amazon Prime Pantry, and I adore this Clear & Clear Morning Burst Facial Cleanser. I remember trying it for the first time, and thinking that it wasn't going to ""wake me up"" as the commercial suggested. But sure enough, it did! It smells great, and the beads help do away with any dirt or grim below the surface. I think it's an excellent product, and I've continued to buy it for several years. I panic each time I notice I'm running low! It's perfect for individuals with sensitive skin, and need a heavy duty cleanser that's still someone gentle! I've had a tough time picking products because of my sensitive skin, but I feel this does a great job! This is great face wash, it doesn't over dry my face like a lot of face washes do.  It smells wonderful and is very refreshing, great for my showers first thing in the morning. I use it every morning and will keep doing so as it has been a long time since I found a face wash I really like. Love the feeling this gives my face after I use it. I've honestly always been a noxema girl, but tried a sample and loved it. So now I use this in the shower and my noxema after. My face has never looked better. Perfect perfectly reliable product My gosh, I love this stuff. No better facial cleanser out there and no better deal than through Amazon. Wake up actually feeling refreshed in the morning and doesn't leave that oily residue like some others I've tried. Just try it... you'll fall madly in love as well. I've been using this for years mostly because I love the smell! It's also a pretty gentle exfoliator. Nice, small beads that don't irritate you as bad as some other scrubs do. Love it! Cleans face, wipes off all dirt, leaves skin so soft!! Smells amazing!! https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KZ225VA/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_4 I like the mini-beads in this product b/c the liquid in this product helps to clean my pores. Love the refreshing scent. Great cleanser..my face feels clean and comfy!!! My daughters love Clean & Clear products.  This one has a nice scent and works well. I love this cooling face wash. Love this stuff. I love the feeling of this face wash not just in the morning but any time of day! I actually love this for my face. Doesn't give me a cooling effect but works great. This is a really great product. In the morning, it wakes you up. The smell is very refreshing. The price is also very reasonable! Good Love this stuff, use it daily every morning. It gives you that clean feeling without completely drying out your face like some washes. I also really like the scrub factor from the coarse beads.Some facewashes cost a small fortune, but this is perfect for everyday use. This is a great product, I love it.  It cleans my face well without over-drying (which has always been a problem for me).  However, the price on Amazon is a huge ripoff... you can buy the larger 8oz bottle at W@lm@rt for the same price that they are selling the 5oz bottle for here."
B071KKT7Y9," Excellent product that leaves your face nice & clean, but not at all drying.  By the way I am a senior age 72! After 5 days of using this 2x/day, I’m really liking it.  Face feels clean and not tight.  Excited to try the other products in this line. Natural and gentle wash that goes a long way - love it! Bought it for my other half, she loves it. I purchased the Vitamin C Facial Cleanser after someone told me about this product. The product came on time. I love the fact that it comes in a plastic bottle, so I do not have to worry about it falling on the floor in my bathroom and shattering. The pump also works well! I was also shocked to see that the product clearly had labeled an expiration date/Best By date (which I have never seen on a makeup/facial product before). I am a student, so it is the perfect size for my bags for my commute back and forth from school to my dorm. Since I still break out, I find the wash to be gentle on my skin. I also find that it is a gentle cleanser and washes off easily. The face wash also takes off my makeup well. All in all, I find that this product is gentle, cleansing, removes makeup well, is easy to use, and leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth. I love this product and highly recommend it!!! It’s a pleasure using this new vitamin c facial cleanser, so gentle and leaves my skin refreshed and clean while retaining its moisture. The pump makes it so easy to use and delivers a small amount of the face wash which is enough for my face and neck. Happy to see the list of the natural ingredients and the scientific background supporting them. I started about three weeks ago and very pleased to continue. I bought several of TakeCare&TLC's products, including this Wash, the Facial Moisturizer Serum and the Moisturizer Cream.  I have to say, while I really like all of them, the wash is definitely a favorite.  It has a great, light scent, foams up nicely, and leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed.  I will say that you do not need a full pump of this stuff.  A tiny pea size amount should be more than enough.  This wash should last me several months. Usually after washing my face with different products, my skin feels dry. After I tried this new facial cleanser I was surprised that my skin felt so nice without any dryness. It is a gentle but effective face wash with hydrating and anti oxidant natural ingredients. I follow with the serum and vitamin C moisturizer from the set by the same company for daily skin care regime and am very happy with them. I bought the whole set for myself and my niece and she is happy as well with the products. We love the fact that the products are natural and not tested on animals. Love this wash! Smells wonderful and love that it has natural ingredients. It makes my face feel smooth and refreshed. I bought this Facial Cleanser, Let me tell you, this is the best face wash that I have ever used. I use it 3 times a week and my face feels and looks brighter after every use. and the best is that it is organic, and not tasted on animals. I love that it's so natural !Cleans up my make up very quick and easy and leaves it fresh and clear!Will definitely purchase again!"
B01MDJWS9A," I bought this because of my acne and I love it, yeah I was skeptical at first because I have tried so many products. Don't expect instant results but over the course of 2 weeks you will notice improvements not all of it will go away but it will clear your face up I definitely will continue to purchase and recommend that you try I’ve had acne prone skin for 7 years now, I’m 21. I wouldn’t say these products are miracle workers, but they don’t break me out. Finding a silicone free, natural face care line is super difficult. My skin breaks out because of my wacky hormones and most likely some other underlying issues but this stuff doesn’t make it any worse. I’ve done hours of research about ingredients that aren’t good for acne prone skin and these products get the green light.The cleanser is exfoliating, almost okay for everyday use. I have sensitive skin and it doesn’t dry me out or rip my face apart. The cleanser has helped my acne the most. I love rejuvenate and hydrate, but I prefer hydrate. I also mix in some Josie Maran Argan oil with both moisturizers and it’s AMAZING. Without an extra few drops of oil I feel both moisturizers don’t give my combination skin enough hydration. Lastly, the mask is alright. It definitely pulls out impurities from your pores, you can see all of it when the mask dries. Pretty gross, but effective! The mask does dry me out a bit but most clay masks do. Although, It’s definitely not too harsh on my skin.Only negative thing I have to say is that each time I go back to repurchase this set, the price seems to keep sky rocketing up. It was an amazing deal around $45 but now it’s getting a little too pricey when you’re on a budget. The products are not worth the price when sold seperately as well. By far one of the best lotions I have tried. Will definitely reorder. My skin has never been so smooth and fresh in years. I use to have issues with oily and dry skin and this skin care system has even out my complexion like none other I tried. I have super sensitive skin and it has not bothered it at all.  Thank you Nayelle! I been used this product 3 weeks now. My skin feels very smooth and soft. The smell doesn't bother me anymore. I feel like my wrinkles got little disappear and I look little younger hahaha...( this is very important..i'm 38 years old...) Let see what happen after 3 more month...maybe I won't get aged.... I am so glad I came across this product! I have been using a non-organic skin care line for the past year, and have been wanting to switch to a natural product after researching harmful chemicals that were in my previous skin care line. I have been using this product for about two weeks, and already see a huge improvement in my skin texture and tone. Some of my red spots and bumps are disappearing. I have oily skin that tends to break out easily, and have had no breakouts since using this product. I have felt more confident not wearing makeup -- which is something I usually never do! I am very excited about this product line! This stuff is simply amazing I only  been useing it for a short while now going on two weeks and already I can see and feel a difference my skin is so soft I'm acne prone an I can even see a difference with my acne my skin is toneing out so nice I love the smell of the products the lotions are amazing not greasy I'm just in love with these products so far i have sensitive skin an these products have been amazing to my skin I deff will be purchasing more I am happy I finally found a skin regime that is good for my skin and that I love and nor crazy expensive I am 1000% happy Awesome products!  My skin feels so soft!  It also seems to have calmed down from breakouts and redness!  I contacted Nayelle regarding an eye product, and the scientist behind the product wrote back that he had great results using the creams around the eyes, as well!  So, just one product for the entire face and neck!  How much easier can that be!  And, love the price from Amazon!  Still waiting the see about the anti-aging aspect!  I am 56 years old with semi-sensitive skin. FANTASTIC PRODUCTS!!  As someone with super sensitive skin, I usually don't experiment or try new skin products.  But when I heard of Nayelle - a natural and organic skin product line - I really wanted to try it.  It has been wonderful for me - no reactions, just nice, clear, smooth skin.  Other people have been commenting on how good my skin looks.  5/5 rating from me. Since I have sensitive skin on the drier side, I was curious about trying Nayelle when I heard it was a natural, organic and probiotic.  I love the smell and feel of the cleanser, mask, hydrating day cream and anti-aging night cream.  What I love even more is how soft my skin feels.  You don't have to use very much product, just a pump covers my face. I love this product. Really like this regimen!  I have been using for about 2 weeks.  Like the grit (bamboo) in the cleanser - not too much/not too little.  It is not super foamy, but my skin feels very clean.Day time and night time moisturizer is perfect weight and not greasy at all.  My skin feels brighter!  Pores are definitely smaller.  Hoping to see improvement in skin discoloration.For a product with this level of high-quality ingredients, the price is perfect! I have very sensitive skin and all the products make your skin feel so nice.  I am very pleased with this product.  It does not break out my skin which most products do.  I would buy this product again. I never write reviews for products but this skin care line is fantastic.  I love the way my skin feels after cleaning and how my face absorbs the moisturizer.  I have very sensitive skin and this product does not burn my skin.  I live in a dry climate in CO and my skin has either been to dry or to oilly; this product balances my skin and I have not had a break out.  Love, love this skin care line.  Looking forward to more products by this company. My skin didn't look so good in a long time! I have combination, really prone to acne skin. So I always need to be very careful what I use on it. I've been using Paula's choice, but it's so expensive. This whole set basically costs like one moisturizer there. I've been very hesitant about results because of such an inexpensive price. I haven't had any breakouts since I started using it. Really love this product!  My skin looks better than it has looked in a long time! I’m a mid twenties male and was hesitant about trying a skincare product for my dry face and hands, but I was very pleased and my dryness was cured within a few weeks! Really makes a difference if you stick with it. Didn’t notice an issue with pumps like other reviews. Their website mentioned they recently fixed the issue with the pumps. I actually won this during the Prime giveaways and I have used it for a few days and I love it. Bought this for my daughter, she loves it."
B01LYMK0W3," Great product! Works just like how a real mud mask should be. Price is good.  Highly recomended .! i use this 3-4x a week for my whole face, daily as an acne spot remover and ..stings a bit, and u can feel it as soon as u put it on. it doesnt have any odor, and its not oily, compared to department stores brand names the price for this is just the same. and its organic, cruelty free just like it says. We used this for my sister's spa bachlorette party. All of the girls loved it! Love it, I love how it made my skin look and feel. Excellent product will definitely continue to buy it This product is amazing. Makes my skin feel fresh.It added a glow to my face. Worth a try! Very nice. Skin feels great after. I really like this stuff, it's a little smelly but not too overpowering. I put it on my face after my shower and before applying any other serums. I put on a very thin layer and let it dry for about 15 mins. It made my face feel tight as it dried. I washed it off with wet cotton pads and dried my face. My skin felt so soft and smooth after using this wonderful mask! I noticed the next day that my face was not as oily in my normal oily spots! I was so happy, my face is always shining in the summer so hopefully this will help me keep control! The only downfall was the stirring; the mud and water separate so you have to mix it back together before using, not the worst thing ever just have to make sure to do it! Still giving it 5 stars for the results!! Very nice product . Will sure continue to use. I simply love this Toulon Dead Sea Mud Mask! The Toulon Dead Sea Mud Mask really makes your face and neck feel fresh and amazing. It clears out your pores and brightens your skin as well. I really like how it's all natural ingredients. It does have a weird smell but it is worth the way it makes your skin feel. It is dark in color and thick. Another plus to it is that there's a lot of it (4 oz) so it will last you a very long time. That depends on how much you use the Toulon Dead Sea Mud Mask. I use it once a week because I do not want to over dry my skin. After that, I use a moisturizer. It is natural that the dead sea mud mask will dry your face at first but after that, it leaves GREAT results, I get great results. I would say this will last me 2-3 months but again, like I said that depends on how much you use it. Also, the price is great for the quality and amount of the Toulon Dead Sea Mud Mask. This Toulon Dead Sea Mud Mask is just what I need after a long week.In addition, the packaging is great. It is very secure and safe. An added plus is that it came in in a timely manner. Also, the mud mask does not expire until a very long time which is also nice. This is the second Dead Sea Mud Mask I have purchased on Amazon. The first one I purchased is nice, but contains other natural oils and ingredients along with the Dead Sea Mud. This mask is 100% Dead Sea Mud!!! Nothing else, just Dead Sea Mud. I'm thrilled! Although the other mask works great, I wanted pure Dead Sea Mud, so I could make my own mask. I combined this Dead Sea Mud Mask with French Pink Clay, and Fullers Clay (a mix of 2 different clays) and it was excellent! I used it before showering, and did my make-up after my shower. My skin was plump and smooth, and my make-up stayed matte all day (I sometimes get oily in my t-zone). I also used this mask by itself yesterday and achieved the same results. I love this Dead Sea Mud, great quality and 100% pure! I am a huge fan of Toulon's products, and this mud mask is no exception at all.Recently, I have been getting very oily in my t-zone, and I bought this mud mask to help cleanse and minimize the appearance of my pores in that area.I absolutely love this mud mask. Immediately after, my pores look less noticeable and my skin feels so soft.I have been using this 2 or 3 times a week for the past 2 weeks, and I already notice a significant difference in my skin.I would absolutely recommend this product for anybody looking for a quality mud mask! This Dead Sea Mud Mask for face & body by Toulon is my FAVORITE mud mask to date!!Admittedly, I was a bit caught off guard at first because it has a slightly gritty texture to it, whereas all of the other mud masks I have been using since cosmetology school several years ago have been smooth & creamy with zero grit.  After I read the label & realized there are no additives of salt, sand, etc. I figured I would still give it a go.  I am SO happy I did as it made my skin SUPER SOFT & it had a GLOW to it too.This stuff is AWESOME!!  A little goes a long way.. don't let the seemingly small jar size fool you... it will last a while.I have (((gulp))) aging skin & try to use a mask & deep scrub once per week.  I do not always remember to do it, though it may be easier to remember with this mask as it smells SO PURE withOUT any headache inducing, nauseating fragrances added like to some other mud masks I have tried.  I kind of ""forgot"" my weekly mud masks when I would feel sick during & after them from the gross, strong smell.  THIS ONE is FABULOUS though... ZERO headche or nausea :).I WOULD purchase this again!! When I lived in the city, had a 9-5 job, and was around people all day, I used to pamper myself with facials, face treatments, mud masks, nice nails, salon hair-do's, etc.  But I've since moved to the country and am a farm who's outside most days covered in dirt.  But I was getting sick and tired of seeing dirty pores and facial skin that has lost its luster.The ingredients in this mud mask beauty product were all natural and passed muster with me, so I decided to give it a try.  What I like to do with my mud masks to really suck out and clean my pores is to put it on heavily, let it dry, and then re-mist it so it's damp again.  Each time it dries it feels like it's pulling more dirt and grime out of my pores.  I do this two or three times.  Then I wet a wash cloth with warm water and gently wipe it off.It left my skin feeling fresh, a little tight, and my pores (which are huge) clean!  Immediately afterwards I moisturized with some coconut oil because otherwise I know my skin and it would feel dry in bed at night.I'm happy with this product and super happy with their Customer Service.  The product originally arrived leaking or as if it had already been opened.  The inside of the box was dirty with mud.  I contacted them, and they told me it should have had a seal around the outside.  It did not.  They immediately replaced it for me, and the replacement was here in two days! I bought this mud mask a long time ago and am only now getting to writing a review. First of all its from a brand that I trust. TOULON makes very high quality skin care products and you can tell that they really have thought of everything when they developed their product line.I love this dead sea mud mask! The texture is clay-like and a very thick but doesn't have an overwhelming smell. You don't have to put very much on your face to get the desired results. I found that putting a thin, even layer worked best and dried nicely. My skin feels really tight once it dries and then I just rinse it off after 10-15 minutes. I like to apply this right before taking a bath.This is something that I try to do on a weekly basis and I find it leaves my face feeling so soft. The results are pretty immediate. I recently purchased a brush which definitely helps with application but have been using my fingers and find it works as well. Overall this product met my expectations and I would recommend it to others. This mud mask has the consistency of real mud, not nearly as gritty as I would have thought it would be and much more of a liquid than a solid. Does a great job exfoliating and cleaning pores, while leaving your skin moisturized and feeling fresh. I experienced no redness or irritation from using this product. I'd suggest giving it a stir before applying if possible to get a more solid consistency. Also, I made a mess of drips and spots the first time used it and that is my fault nothing to do with the product, it dries like mud and cleans up much easier with just a wet towel should you get it on bath fixtures or shower curtain. I love this mask! I have used this mask twice now and It is awesome. I apply this to a freshly washed face. This Dead Sea mud mask is cool and spreads on smooth and creamy. In about 5-10 min it begins to dry and I can feel it tighten on my skin (not uncomfortable at all). I love that it doesn't drip or itch as it dries. The best thing about this facial mask is that when rinsed off, my face feels refreshed and oil free without the irritating dry feeling. I have used this once a week for two weeks now and I can see a major difference in my skin. My acne is cleared up, my skin tone is even, my face is hydrated but not oily, and the bags under my eyes are less visible. I love this product. Would definitely recommend! I am seriously starting to love this brand! This is the second time I have purchased one of their products and I love this one just as much as I loved the first one. The first one I got was Gentle Milk Cleanser: Face Wash for Dry & Sensitive Skin; Mild Facial Cleanser with AHA, Lactic Acid, Aloe Vera & Antioxidants. If I wash my face with the milk cleanser and then do the mask the results are astonishing.When you first put this all over your freshly cleaned damp face, avoiding the eyes and mouth, it starts to really make your face tight. I could not even make a facial expression. It was kind of cool. Now I completely understand why they say avoid the eyes and mouth area. That might have been kind of painful. It was really cool, as it was drying it started to look kind of like a facial camo paint job! You only have to leave it on for 5-10 minutes, but no longer than 30 minutes. I left it on for the full 10 to get the full effect. After washing it off, which by the way washed off really easy, my face felt amazing.This is a product that I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good facial mask. And it's from the Dead Sea! What's not to love?In your quest for the truth about this product, I hope that you have found my review both informative and helpful. And as always, HAPPY SHOPPING!!! This is a good quality mud mask. It went on easy and it dries pretty fast. It doesn't have much of a scent so that was a plus because I have sensitive skin. I noticed that my pores shrank after using it a few times, my pimples disappeared and my skin was very smooth afterward. My skin just felt so clean and detoxified. It came in a very appealing packaging and was not damaged. Shipping was really fast. This product if worth every penny. A face mask should never be allowed to fully dry on your skin. The main benefit of a mud mask is in the damp phase where the nutrients are absorbed by the skin. During phase 2, the mask will begin to dry & stimulate blood flow, causing skin to contract. Where most masks go wrong is by drying too quickly, thus drawing out too much moisture. This drying sensation is often mistaken for a ""tightening and lifting effect"" but really leaves skin dehydrated, irritated and itchy. This was actually my first Dead Sea mud mask that I have ever tried. It was pretty good I did definitely like it. As soon as I put it on I did notice that it was starting to get tingly but I'm assuming that that's what it supposed to do. I think I put too much on to start with because it took more than 5 to 10 minutes for it to dry on my face. It left my face feeling softer and exfoliated. I really, REALLY like this mask, and I did not expect to. It's literally just mud. Being from the midwest, I am used to mud being pitch black. This mud is gray. I applied a thin layer, and left it on for 10 minutes, just like the directions said. I could feel the mud drying, and it had a slight tightening effect on my skin. I rinsed the mud off after it was all dry, which was a lot easier than I expected it to be. I have heard some people talk about a smell with dead sea mud, and I didn't notice a smell putting it on my face. I did notice a slight fishy smell when taking it off though, but nothing overwhelming. Honestly, I expected NOTHING from this mask other than a fun pampering thing for myself. However, I noticed a difference right away! My face seemed to look a lot brighter and silkier (is that a thing??) than before. It was also super soft and smooth.I am so happy with this mask, and I get the hype. Love it! This product is the first mud mask I have ever used. Upon opening it I was surprised by the pleasant smell - like incense or light perfume. The texture was just what I would expect a mud mask to feel like - muddy. It went on easily and washed off easily leaving my skin feeling soft and smooth. I don't know how much it cleaned my pores out but my face did feel very cleansed and fresh. I will be using this again and I would recommend this brand and seller to anyone looking for a face and body mask. One of my favorites! It goes on smoothly and it only takes 4 or 5 minutes to dry so that's a plus for lazy people like me. Like most masks, it starts to feel tight when it's dry but that means that it's pulling out all the bad stuff. It's very different from any mud mask I have tried, when I was it off I'm also exfoliating my skin because it has very little peices of.... I'm not sure what it is, it feels kind of like sand. What I like about it the most is it didn't dry out my skin! I didn't need moisturizer after using it but I put a little for extra moisture. I have been using this natural dead sea mask for some time now.  It has been amazing for my skin.  First off the reason I tried this one is because it was one of the only ones I could find that was actually dead sea mud.  It is the only ingredient!  There were no fillers so that made me happy.  It detoxifies by skin and leaves is exfoliated and smooth.  I use it about 3 times a week and will continue to purchase it.  I am a happy customer. This dead sea mud mask is terrific!!!!  It nourishes and moisturizes my skin while keeping it tight and toned to perfection.  I really love that it helps to decrease the wrinkles and laugh lines and keeps my skin looking and feeling youthful.  I have not used it on my body yet but I will give an update once I do.  So far I am very pleased with my purchase and I will be purchasing from this seller again in the near future. I have been using dead sea mask for a while and every once in a while I change brand to see what else is out there and I came across this particular one. The first thing I realized is that immediately after I put in on I can feel the effect of it on my skin. The smell is kind of a mud smell which is supposed to be and not like some other products that smell like perfume and chemical. The color is gray and it get lighter as it dries. It's super easy to wash afterward as well. The feeling after you wash it off your face is super awesome! Amazing stuff! My face feels brand new and tight after trying this mask. I love it. I have never used a real mud mask before and thought I'd pamper myself with the Dead Sea Mud Mask.  I know that Deal Sea products from Israel have a high rating so I chose Toulon's mask.  I applied this gray  mud mask over clean skin as I was getting ready for bed.  It really looked just like mud and went on smoothly.  It was easy to apply and I was careful around my eyes and mouth.  I left it on about ten minutes and washed it off before it developed a hard finish.  I was pleased with the smooth feeling of my skin and it did not require more time in my regimen if I apply it as soon as I start my routine.  I think I can get a lot of masks out of this jar because it doesn't  take that much mud for a mask. I like the fact that it promotes cell regeneration and is made from organic ingredients. It moisturizes and nourishes my skin with  the essential materials.  My skin feel clean and hydrated after using this mud mask.  I follow this mud mask with Toulon's Essential Mineral Daily Moisturizer.  I look forward to more  mud mask pamperings!  I may gift a jar to my grand daughter who suffers from acne as it's also helpful with that skin problem. Could not wait to try this.. u notice the difference almost immediately. You feel it working on your skin. Definitely going to incorporate this in my weekly routine I love this dead sea mud mask .You off can really feel it tightening your skin and it helps you wash your face to remove all the dirt and oil .you do need to follow directions . I had to rewash my face cause I wear glasses and when I had all the mud off I thought  I was done .When i put my glasses back on I almost run for the woods I had millions of black heads I thought it must really pull them up  lol I got my wash rag and washed all that mud out of my poors when I was through my skin felt tight even the skin on my throat  .I love this mud it worked even to close my poors. I love this dead sea facial mud mask. When you put it on your face it looks greyish and cold, as it begins to dry to your face it turns to that greenish color. After about 15 minutes and it is dry against my skin I then remove it with a hot steamy wash cloth. I really enjoy using this mud mask. I have extremely senstive skin and have not experienced any reactions to this mask. I received this Dead sea mud mask for my face and I absolutely love it.  I apply it and let dry and after washing it off it makes my face feel so refreshed, clean, and This is an highly affordable yet effective mud mask.  The packaging is beautiful, and I love it.  I would highly recommend this to anyone that is looking for an amazing mud mask. This is an item that I will repurchase. I was hesitant when ordering this because I have sensitive skin and wasn't sure how it would react on my face.  The MOMENT I started to put it on my face I could feel it working.  It makes my face feels so tight.  I can see stuff coming out of my pores when its all dry, kind of gross but mostly satisfying.  I would definitely recommend. Makes my skin feel very soft and smooth. It also helped a lot with redness. It did sting a little bit when I first applied- it didn't bother me but if you have super sensitive skin you should be careful applying it because it seemed like it might hurt for some people. I'd definitely buy it again though. I have another mud mask but this one is by far my favorite. It has a scrub in it so when you apply it to your face it gets in there good!!! It doesn't over dry my face either. I love this product!! I adore this dead sea facial mud mask. It feels wonderful on my face, nice and cool and moisturizing, and my skin feels smooth and soft when I wash off the mask. I find it easiest to wash it off in the shower, since it is so thick, it's hard to wash off over the sink. I am really happy with mask.  Dead sea mud is great for yoru skin.  I chose this mask because it only has dead sea mud in it.  Other masks are loaded with other filler products and some don't even have real mud from the dead sea.  The minerals from the dead sea make my skin so soft and silky sooth.  I use it a couple of times a week.  I only use a little bit and let it dry on my face.  After 10 minutes, I rinse it off.  My skin looks great and rejuvenated. I am a beauty professional, so I'm always up for trying new or great products. I've always believed in mud masks. They really do make your skin feel great.  There's a reason mud is good for your skin. It helps pull out impurities and mineralize your skin. This mud mask mad my skin feel great.  I always use a face mask after freshly cleansed face or after a shower. Your pores are more open one you wash your face. It helps the pores get even cleaner if the mud can deeply go into the pores. My skin feels tightened and toned, as well as my pores appearing smaller. Always wait till the mud dries on your skin. That's when you can wash it off. This did the job. My skin is glowing! I use this once a week before showering. Its feels pretty good and seems to make my skin tighten up a bit. It washes off easily. I dont notice any smell. It does not sting as some have said, maybe if you have open sores but not a regular healthy skin issue. I really love how this Mask made my face feel after using it. My face was really smooth and looked like I had just been to a day spa. It really made my face look like I was a few years younger because it brought out all of the impurities. My color was balanced and all the redness was gone. This is a really great product with the most natural ingredients that really work together. The result is amazing. It exfoliates and cleans the pores making them smaller and my skin more clearer. It made my skin more firmer and tighter adding more elasticity. It really gave me a new glow making me look and feel great. I recommend using it a couple times a week to get great results. i like that this mask is mud and doesnt contain too many ingredients its only dead sea mud from israel and DMDM hydantoin (0.009%) DMDM hydantoin is an antimicrobial formaldehyde releaser preservative.it s a good size container 4 oz will go a long wayi use it on my face and neck, let it pose 10 minute and rince with warm water , my skin feels very clean and soft after the mask then i apply a good amouth of cream since mud mask make my skin feel a little drythe mud doesnt have a strong or unpleasant smell, it has a dark grey color and a good consistencyi think it s great product at a great price this will probably last me for a year! I really love all the products of this brand are awesome. This mask for the face and body has made my skin smoother and more shiny. It is also made with real ingredients. I love that with only 10 minutes you notice the difference in your skin. This dead sea mask is a great product.  I feel that it really helps to detoxify my skin.  I love that it is a natural product and pure mud from the dead sea.  My skin feels smooth after I use it and it looks great too. Great find, I have tried a lot of different products in my time and this one is pretty decent. It didn't leave my skin dry and tight. I was able to apply and rinse with ease. I  think I will  use like once a week to figure out what my sin results turn out. The smell was not unbearable and the texture was okay. I have sensitivity to scents so this is always challenging when ordering on line. So far I am pleased. This mud mask completely removed all my blackheads and cleansed my entire face of all impurities. I was genuinely surprised how magical this stuff is. Not only did it clean my pores but brightened my entire face as well. I would recommend this mask to everyone and anyone that wants a thorough face cleanse. I have absolutely fallen in love with this Dead Sea Mud. I even contacted the seller (which I never do) and they assured me it's officially 100% pure Dead Sea Mud from Israel.  The results are impressive. Right after I rinse it off and dry my face, my skin feels amazing: soft- smooth- like a baby's bottom. No joke. LOVE this stuff. I don't like spending that much on products like this, but it goes a long way, so you got my 5 starts! Even my hubby uses it on his nose to help shrink his pores. I'm in love.  I've never used a sea mask before and now I'll never not use one again.  This is definitely a high quality,  effective product.  I followed all the instructions (even though it felt So weird on my face)  and when I finally ruined it all off.... It was like looking at my face 5 years ago!  I don't have enough words to express how happy I am to have this stuff.  My skin is the softest,  brightest,  smoothest it's been in a LONG LONG time.  I now than recommend this to all women especially over the year of 30!! works well and the shipping was expedient. Myself an middle daughter really enjoyed this mask however my oldest daughter who has more sensitive skin did not. Awesome product.  I am a big fan of TOULON products and this one is a winner.  The mask is natural and pure and does a great job drawing out impurities and exfoliating.  Leaves my skin looking fabulous.  A real gem of a product Very nice mask. Loved the results! Pleasant smell to mask and nice consistency. Very pleased with this purchase. You can see changes almost immediately. My face never had that much acne so I didn't notice the changed until I put it on my shoulders and upper back (it's not bad however if I itch it or break it open then it gets really red) now however they are pretty much gone. I also only bought this on a wim for cyber monday but I'm glad I got it. I really enjoy this mudd rub my face feels so clean and soft. I would recommend this product for sure a lot better outcome than the over the counter brands i have tried. I got this product for a dicounted price I am under no obligation to do a review. And I take reviews very serious! I buy a lot of products on Amazon Prime and i never buy products on line without reading reviews. I just tried this. I am stunned at how soft my face feels (well, the non-​fuzzy places anyway) and even my goatee is noticeably softer! I haven't been this impressed by a facial product since those pore strips were invented. It feels good on my face.I like the way it tingles and feels cool.I usually put it on before I shower and let it stay on for a bit then wash it off in the shower.Good feel and smell. Makes my face feel very smooth and clean Made my skin nice and radiant! Highly recommend! daughter loved. Love how my skin is feeling with this product it look very clean! Recommend! I kept the mask on for 8 minutes, and took it off and my skin felt noticeably smoother and softer. 2 days later, I was surprised that my face was still super soft and smooth - This is my new go-to mask! It is great to think about drawing out all the toxins from deep in my skin.  I love masks and this mask is one of the best.  The mud goes on smooth. You only need a little bit.  It quickly dries and you can easily wash it off.  It draws out a lot of the toxins deep in the skin and leavs my skin refreshed and glowing. As someone who deals with problematic skin,  it's always a struggle to find something that works well.  The mud mask was easy to use, dried quickly and managed to pull out the skin impurities.  It did tingle upon application but the results were immediate as my skin looked brighter and felt smooth So i bought this because i have oily skin and i needed to remove the grime that had collected over the years.  I love this stuff.  I used the mud mask for awhile and it seemed to clear my pores.  My skin got a little tighter as my pores shrank.  I recommend this product to anyone. I have awful combination skin, and this mask didn't dry me out. It left my skin feeling soft and hydrated, but not oily. Would definitely recommend! Love the way this stuff feels and makes my skin feel I started using masks to exfoliate my skin and I soon got hooked on dead see masks since they also improve circulation.  This mask is quick and easy with great results.  My skin glows after my 10 minute mask treatment. I feel like my skin looks great and it also makes my skin healthier. The mask is dark and rich, full of great nutrients and minerals from the dead sea.  I have used it a couple of times and it makes my skin feel so silky smooth and soft. I am really liking it and will continue to use it a couple of times a week as part of my skin care routine This is one amazing product.  I use this when I just feel my skin isn't glowing or feeling as I think it should.  I do find that it tingles a little which I didn't expect at all but I love it.  I apply and allow it to dry maybe 30 minutes and wash off. I really like this! I tried it tonihjt and my face is sooo soft! It doesnt burn or sting and is un scented! My face is soft and not oily! I approve:) and i do reccomend and also you get a lot of the product a little goes a long way i also found out Amazing!!!!Makes skin super smooth but make sure there is no contact with eyes. Happened to me and I was miserable for hours washing and washing it out. Other then that which was my fault I love it. I will continue to use this product weekly. Great Mask.  It is exactly as I wanted it to be.  So happy with this mud mask from the dead sea in Israel.  I especially like that it is pure mud but has no smell at all.  I have used other masks that smell horrible.  So happy with pure and fragrance free. Interesting smell and texture- but I have used mud like this before so I knew what to expect. Creamy  consistency , and strong well, but leaves the pores feeling great. I personally only plan to use on face and neck since the bottle is so small. My girlfriend got this mask and had me try it. After the proper amount of resistence, I gave it a try. Have been using it once a week since. Love it! Really cleared up my skin. Also, she says my skin tone is more even too. Thanks babe. I absolutely LOVE this mask! To begin, I love pampering myself and am a big fan of facial masks, BUT this one is just amazing. My face feels and looks great after just one use. I will continue to use it and hope that my spots will diminish. Arrived fast and so far i've used twice. My face does feel good after using however i believe you should try something regularly for 30 days when it comes to skin care. Thus far it is doing what it should and my pores look smaller. Two thumbs up for TOULON dead sea mask.  I love that it is pure dead sea mud from Israel without the filler ingredients other masks have.  My skin feels great after applying, letting the mud begin to dry and then rinsing it off. This mask has rejuvenated my skin.  I love products that have real pure dead sea mud in them. The mask works great and makes my skin feel firmer immediately after using. it is helping shrink my pores and rid me of any blemishes. smells really great, it glides on to your face really fast and easily. after a week of use, my face is so soft, my pores has gotten smaller and my make up goes on flawlessly like a air brushed finished look! I love it!! I’ve never been to the Dead Sea, and now I think I don’t need to go (well, maybe I’ll go to see Masada). The feel and smell of this mask takes me there. And the results are as promised. Smooth, soft, clear skin. No fancy scents or added ingredients. Pure and simple mud, my pores were immediately smaller! I love this mask. There is a lot of product in it too! Enough for many many uses as you only need a small amount. It's a little gritty and I look silly with it on but it left my skin soft smooth . Feels great and makes skin look good Great mask.. make sure you use a thin amount or else it will take forever to dryI use this in between facials.It helps a lot with black heads and clearing the pores. I am very pleased with this face mask.  When the mud dries and tightens on my face it feels like it is really making a difference.  My skin looks great after the treatment. Love this, my face felt so clean and smooth after using.  No smell, very think and not runny, goes in smooth and dries quickly.  I recommend purchase! love it! I  definitely recommend this This mask is great for getting the toxins out of my skin. My face looks great after using this wonderful mask from the Dead Sea.

B0001EKYJM," Best face wash ever, extremely gentle, have used for years. I have sensitive oily acne prone skin. I use this product with a washcloth in the morning and with the Clarisonic Mia at night (first I remove excess oil with a tissue).For anyone interested in my full routine:Wake up: Thayer's Cucumber TonerMorning face routine:1) Exuviance Gentle Cleansing Creme (use with a washcloth to get a ""cleaner feel"")2) Paula's Choice Resist Ultra-Light Super Antioxidant Concentrate Serum3) Paula's Choice Skin Balancing Invisible Finish Moisture Gel4) Paula's Choice Calm Redness Relief Moisturizer Normal to Oily (I only apply this to my neck but it's also okay for the face)5) Exuviance Sheer Daily Protector SPF 50 (this has a slight tint to it so I don't use foundation and I just follow this with Paula's Choice powder)6) Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer with Sunscreen SPF 50 (I only use this on my neck). This product is sold on Amazon as well as in drugstores and big box stores.Evening Routine:1) Wipe face with a tissue to remove excess oil and powder2) Paula's Choice Gentle Touch Makeup Remover (I only use this to remove eye makeup but it can be used on the whole face-I've just never tried it)3) Exuviance Gentle Cleasing Creme with Clarisonic Mia4) Retin-A Micro Pump .04%5) Exuviance Night Renewal Hydragel (I only use this on my face, for some reason this product gives me a rash on my neck but it works very well on my face...I have ultra sensitive crazy skin!)6) Paula's Choice Redness Relief Moisturizer Normal to Oily (again, I only use this on my neck but I used to use it on my face at night)When going to the pool or beach I use Elta MD UV Sport SPF 50 on my face.  It doesn't sting my eyes like a lot of sunscreens do and it doesn't cause my acne to flare up.I'm 37 years old and my skin was under control with Proactiv from age 22 until I had my son at 32. The above routine works wonders for me but we all have different skin. From my experience most hair styling products make my face breakout, so I avoid them.I believe Retin A has helped me a lot. If you have acne I would at least try it although it does take months to see results AND you have to be religious about Sunscreen.If you try Retin A I highly recommend reading the ""How to Use Retin-A"" article on the Beautyeditor site. The key to beginning Retin-A is to apply 1 pump once every 3rd night for 2 weeks, then every other night for 2 weeks, then every night. If your face gets red or upset, return to every other night.You can contact Paula's Choice and Exuviance for inexpensive samples. Finally a product that replaces the Estee Lauder ""Gentle Cleansing Cream"" I had bought for 30 years, until Estee Lauder discontinued it.  If you like a cream based, whole fast cleanser, try this!  It takes my foundation and eye make up off quickly and easily.  (I don't use waterproof, so not sure how it would work with that type.)  Nice light scent too, barely noticeable and not sudsy in my eyes.  I love this product! I had a makeup artist use this (without water) to remove a full face of makeup in under 30 seconds with a paper towel. I was so impressed by the ease of use and how clean my face felt even without rinsing, that I decided to purchase this. I use it with and without water and I love it. I saw some reviews about people not feeling ""clean"". This product definitely hydrates and doesn't dry out your skin, so that may be different from what some people are used to. I am able to remove a full face of makeup (foundation, concealer, and waterproof mascara) in one quick wash, washing my face for about a minute, leaving no raccoon eyes etc. This product is also very gentle and doesn't burn my eyes. This stuff is just a miracle. It feels like soft lotion going on and is even gentle taking off eye makeup. Remember not to get it in your eyes! It gets everything and your skin feels moisturized and smells so fresh after wiping it all off. Can’t recommend this enough! I used this for a number of years (I use the pump bottle) and love the results.  I used it with the rest of the line - toner and day & night moisturizers.  Thought maybe I'd save a little money by trying other products, so I tried The Body Shop Aloe Calming Facial Cleanser and its whole line, and I tried Avene Extremely Gentle Cleaner Lotion and its whole line.  No comparison.  I am going back to Exuviance - will alternate with the others to finish up the other products, but this is my standard for sure now. This cream cleanses my face and eye makeup without that over drying feeling.It takes a wash cloth or multi applications to really get more than a ""surface"" cleaning. I use their exfoliate with this product to really penetrate the skin and get that deep pore cleanse at least twice a week. I have used this product for about a month now and people are starting to comment how healthy my skin is looking now. That's great seems how I just turned 40! Perfect eye make-up remover. Bought for my 14yr old twins and they said it helped clear up their skin. Love this stuff I started using this cleanser over 2 years ago. I did a ton of research and finally ended up selecting Exuviance. I'm always impressed by the way comes in the boxes. I've never had an issue with one being open or broken etc. The price is great as I'm paying for quality. Not only do I use it now but so does my teenage daughter. Can't imagine using any other product.  Love it! I tried this product before buying it, love the smell, love the fact it doesn't dry out your skin or make it break out, I love this cleanser Love this cleanser - very gentle and smells great, too! I love this cleansing product.  It is very gentle and leaves skin feeling like lotion was applied instead of dried out as it feels when you use soap.  This is accomplished with no strong scent which is important for anyone who is scent sensitive. I've been using this cleanser for years now. It's the only one that works for my sensitive and often acne-prone skin. It has done wonders on evening out my skin tone. Not nearly as blotchy pink as it used to be. Love the Exuviance line! I have used this product for years and like it a lot. Initially found out about it through a Dermatologist that I go to. A little pricey (cheaper then buying it from a doctor) but worth it if you have sensitive and dry skin. As expected! This stuff is really great. I like it because if I'm in a hurry or on the go, I can wash my face without water by using this. My face feels moisturized after as well. I would recommend this. New packaging, but my wife is pleased.  Less waste to the landfill when it's empty.  That's good. Best way to buy I've used this cleanser for years. It's light, I love the smell and works. It doesn't dry out my skin at all. all great items I LOVE this stuff!!! It cleans super heavy eye makeup with eyeliner and mascara off in one sweep. It also doesn't leave any kind of residue afterward like a lot of makeup removers I've used. all is well I have tried just about every cleanser out there and this is my all time favorite.  It leaves my skin feeling much more hydrated and moisturized compared to other cleansers.  I swim laps 3 days a week so need a good cleanser for removing chemicals and any bacteria from the pool.  This has worked great.  I can't say enough about Exuviance products.  They are worth every penny. Make my skin soft and removes makeup. This is a great cleansing cream for ""mature"" skin. It clenas well, but doesn't dry your skin out. I've been using this for 2 months now and still love it. I leaves my skin soft. Most other cleansers leave my skin dry. love the product Wife says she loves how soft and moisturized her skin feels when using this. I have used this product for years and I love it .I want to receive this product on a regular basis. It is very gentle on your skin. Very fast delivery. NeoStrata: EXUVIANCE® Gentle Cleansing Creme ReviewWhen it comes to washes, scrubs and cleaners, the last thing that comes to mind in using a creme. It brings back memories of the old Pond’s tub my Mother used to remove her make-up, which left an oily residue after using it. You knew don’t touch Mom after she removes her make-up! When I received the Cleansing Creme from Exuviance, I must admit that was the first thought that came to mind. I also have to be frank that as much as enjoy “gentle” to my skin products, I stay away from them because they are sometimes too gentle yielding them ineffective. Okay, I have not opened the box and here I am bringing up childhood nightmares, but I always give products a chance and especially those from the NeoStrata family.The Gentle Cleansing Creme from Exuviance, is advertised as a soap-free formula. It allows the user to gently remove everything from make-up, build-up, to the everyday impurities our face may collect during the day. At the same time it serves not only as a cleanser but a moisturizer. If you thought that was already impressive, the Gentle Cleansing Creme from Exuviance also contains anti-aging ingredients like Polyhydroxy Acid (PHA), and other botanical ingredients that help sooth and condition your skin. The product is gentle enough for sensitive skin suffers but can be used by people with combination skin too. It’s a friendly cleanser!Ingredients (as listed on the website): Water (Aqua), Isododecane, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/ Dicaprate, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Isononanoate, Butylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate SE, PEG-100 Stearate, Triundecanoin, Cetyl Alcohol, Octyldodecanol, Stearyl Alcohol, Gluconolactone, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Althaea Officinalis Root Extract, Chamomile Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Propylene Glycol, Laureth-7, Polyacrylamide, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben, Parfum (Fragrance), Benzyl Benzoate.Verdict:Okay, I clear my head and start using the cleanser creme twice a day as recommended. The first day the product arrived, I washed my face in middle of the day to get an idea how it worked and how it would make my skin feel. You simply moisten your face and hands, pump out a small dollop, and begin to massage your face and neck. Always with an upward circular motion. The Exuviance Gentle Cleansing Creme gives you the option in using a facial tissue for removal, or you may simply just rinse your face off with warm water. The first difference I noticed and this is just after my first use, is a silky feeling. My face was super smooth and get this, not greasy. Even my hands were left feeling soft! I opted for the rinsing with warm water method for removal and mostly because it is what I am most comfortable with but I like the idea of being able to use a tissue if needed. This means no excuses when it comes to make-up removal no matter how late I get home! The next week I began to use the wash when I had make-up and for those days I did not wear any too. If you use a waterproof eyeliner or mascara, I did find I was left with raccoon-ish eyes if I just depended on the cleansing creme, but this also goes for when I just used a common cleanser/scrub before. I always have to address waterproof anything by using a facial wet wipe to insure full removal. Other than this, the cleansing creme is gentle on the skin but it still does it’s job very well at cleaning your face! I want a clean face and washing my face is almost therapeutic for me and this is why I have a unusual collection of face washes. Being able to enjoy make-up means I have to take care of my skin and the first thing I learned about skincare, is how you begin makes a difference. A clean slate is what you want but not a depleted one. Meaning you don’t want to to do what I did in my teen years and treat my skin like if you were stripping wall paper of a wall. I use to think in my teens the cleaner, the better. No oils, no natural sheen just take it all off because I feared blemishes. I did not suffer from them in my teen years, but this is probably why when I hit 25, my face had had it with me and I began to experience break-outs. With Exuviance’s’ Gentle Cleansing Creme, you avoid the over stripping but you do actually end up with a clean surface and super soft skin. As I used the cleansing creme, by week 2, my face was soft 24/7. I did not have to depend on serums for a natural glow and the texture of my skin improved naturally, I was left with a smoother looking surface that allowed my pores and imperfections to appear…..well, smoothed out. I can’t tell you (I know I’m harping on it) how soft my skin feels and appears now. I love it. I don’t have a kid but I assume this is why people state soft as a baby’s bum! I get it now and no breakouts or anything. Right now, the weather in Southern California is mixed. Gloomy days, windy days, to sunny days and my skin is in transition again like these undefined seasons. The calendar says Spring and my nose and allergies agree, but my skin thinks it’s Fall with the way the days change so drastically from one day to another. With Exuviance’s Gentle Cleansing Creme, my skin is moisturized the minute the cleanser finishes washing off the grime of the day and the best part, it comes in a tube versus the jar that I fear! Try it and see for yourself how much the Gentle Cleansing Creme from Exuviance will change your mind and how you can do more for your skin by just using this face wash.I received the above product(s) free of charge from NeoStrata/Exuviance. I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion. My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours. Winter in the north woods of Wisconsin can get pretty dry and rough on the skin so it is important to have a quality product that won't dry out the skin further. I love Exuviance products, I have reviewed several different ones. The Exuviance Gentle Cleansing Creme is formulated to be effective in removing makeup and other impurities without messing with natural moisture in the skin. This creme does not lather up, I was expecting it to because I am used to facial cleansers to foam up. No problem, though, I have been using it for some time now, about a month, and I use it the recommended 2x day. You do not need a lot, I use about 1/4th of a teaspoon each time. It goes on nice and rinses off really well, taking the makeup with. It has a light pleasant smell and the tube is 7.2 ounces so it will last for awhile, which I like. I have experienced no breakouts, just nice smooth skin after I have used it. You can cleanse with it and then use a facial cream of some type or just cleanse, rinse and go. As with other Exuviance products I have tried, I am extremely satisfied!I received this product for my review that is honest and unbiased. I have rosacea and searched forever to find a cleanser that would keep my face clean and clear of breakouts but also be gentle enough not to irritate my sensitive skin. I can't say enough good things about this cleanser. It is moisturizing without feeling oily, and it takes off makeup extremely well. It has a mild, clean scent and feels so refreshing to use. I've been using it for about two years and have no plans to change it. My skin has never looked better. Get it; you won't regret it. I got to try this as a sample and I absolutely love it and I want to get a bottle of this, this is by far the best cleanser for my face and I've tried other brands and haha it's not as amazing as this stuff. This is my new favorite product line.  Will be purchasing this soon!! Exuviance is a brand I just discovered but really like.My face looks clean ,shiny,and has a glow about it.I really like how it cleanses all the impurities and leaves my skin with a fresh appearance. I used to purchase this cleanser at a local department store but they discontinued the line.  I am so happy to find it on Amazon!  I have been using this facial cleanser for over ten years and have not once had a break out since using it.  I have combination skin and this is truly a gente cleanser.  My face does not feel like a shriveled up prune after cleansing.  Instead my skin is nice and soft.  Oh, and my husband used this as well.  He works in a factory and we've notice that he no longer gets blackheads on his nose or forehead."
B0044HL9XM," Great scrub! Never breaks me out and exfoliates my skin This is the only thing that helps my husband's acne. Great cleaser Have been using Dermalogica products for a while they are great. If you're a guy and serious about good skin care and a great shave this one is for you. Last an amazingly long time as it doesn't require a huge amount to keep your face exfoliated and polished.  Had a dermatologist recommend this and glad I took the suggestion.  Thoroughly cleans without stripping your skin.  Makes shaving a lot easier. Awesome produce, good price, great value with Prime shipping.  I always get comments about my ""flawless"" skin since using this My teen daughters both use this daily scrub and achieve great results without using harsh chemicals on their skin! Best face scrub ever. Excellent scrub, also for girls! Love this scrub! Was authentic and sealed. Happy with my purchase :) This is an incredible product. Have tried many different exfoliants over the years and this is absolutely the best one. Very fine crystals make for more comfortable exfoliation; those with larger grains don't feel as nice and also don't feel like they are doing the job. Not harsh but does the trick Great product to use! Great product It works, I've been using it for 2 weeks and my skin feels very soft after using it. I definitely notice the difference. Great This has helped my husband not experience ingrown hairs in his beard!  He loves it!! I love this stuff! Love it ... perfect scrub, not to gritty but sure does the job! Love this face scub, best I have ever used. Wish it was cheaper Love it, use it, and will purchase more for the hoildays.  Gret product, get company, good price.  All men should try it Good stuff! This stuff is fantastic...and less than half the price it costs to buy in Australia. Very fine grit and gentle enough to use everyday. Love my dermalogical products."
B06WPBL4WG," I was a little skeptical about this product,but, I used it the first night and when I woke up the next morning well, I wasn’t that impressed. So I used it again and the next morning my face was really really soft and after about 5 nights of using it I could really see a difference in my laugh lines and crows feet! Bottom line I bought more before I even ran out ! I would definitely recommend this product! Exactly what I expected."
B000XO2YR0," This is just the best stuff ever.  Firms, tightens, cleans, makes you look as good as you should. The best facial wash I've ever used Urth Face Wash lathers up with just small amount and makes the pores on your skin feel/look smaller which draws compliments :-) Best Face wash I've tried Urth's products has been my exclusive skin care brand for almost a decade. I might have gained a couple of pounds, my knees might not love me as much anymore and I might not be able to stay up past midnight ... but my skin looks AWESOME!!In all seriousness, the neutral pH balance of the face cleanser has kept me almost completely free of any skin issues and paired with Urth's other products, has kept me looking young! I am a HUGE fan! I LOVE this face wash, it is effective yet gentle enough to use along with my retin-A. I have combination skin with adult acne and this wash makes my skin feel refreshed and clean without over drying it. I had such a hard time finding a cleanser to use along with my retin A (most make my skin itchy and flaky) and I'm so glad I found the urth line. One bottle goes a long way, it usually last me months and I use it daily. I also recommend the urth face lotion and the scrub, the entire line is just amazing. The Urth Face Wash has a unique and distinct scent to it -- my girlfriend makes snarky remarks about it ""smells like Chinese medicine"".  I suspect this is the tea tree oil ingredient.  Admittedly, when I first used it, I didn't like it either.  But after a few uses, it became an acquired taste and now I look forward to its smell on my face.I think I have an oilier face.  Most products are too strong for my face -- they leave my face feeling ""tight"" (dry, dehydrated?).  This is probably not good.  Urth Face Wash is one of the few I've found that cleans my face well, without leaving it feeling dry.The texture and viscosity are two excellent features of this Wash.  It only takes a few drops of this face wash to cover my entire face, ears, and most of my neck.  I find it frustrating when face washes aren't viscuous enough so I have to get a second squeeze of wash from the bottle -- this is *not* a problem with Urth Face Wash.  If you measure the cost of the bottle in terms of how many face washes you get (probably the best metric instead of just ""cost""), the overall cost of the bottle becomes much less significant.  I feel the bottle has outlasted many of my other face washes, in terms of efficiency, which makes this Wash inexpensive.While I only have good things to say about this face wash, it does have legitimate deterrents for some people.  The ingredient list includes:  peppermint oil, spearmint oil, rosemary extract, and lavendar extract/oil.  These /can/ all be skin irritants, depending on your specific skin type, though I have no irritation from any of these in this cleanser.  Lavendar oil tends to be the most irritating of all these, even in very small amounts. I really like this face wash. I have oily skin, but some of the face wash for oily skin is too much and makes my skin too dry. Other normal face washes leave my skin too oily. This is the perfect alternative for people caught in between. Is also half the price compared to grooming lounge. Which is where I first found this product.It can last a month or two if  you use it sparingly and minimize waste. My face feels great after using this.  It's expensive but lasts forever, I've used it for a few months now and am not even halfway through the bottle. I have been using this product for at least five years now and my skin is in excellent shape. I use to have oily and acne prone skin which is no longer an issue thanks to Urth Face Wash. The best, most refreshing and rejuvenating facial cleanser I've used in years. I felt a breathable difference as soon as I tried it! easy. works.  good viscosity.  I wet my face then pour some of this on my hands.  Then I lather my face with the soap.  Rinse.  Good to go.  Wife sparkles."
B002ZSW7OC," very great quality, and easy to use for men.just need 10 minutes.quick delivery. Absolutely the best in men's masque products! so far no complaints, my face feels clean after using love this! I can actually feel  this product working every time I put it on. Told a couple friends and they love it. Can say it changed them physically  and emotionally Awesome product. Truly does help control oil and blemishes. Love this ""lava"" mask. Leaves my skin feeling/looking great. As with all clay masks, you need to moisturize, moisturize, and moisturize after using it... after you've done that, moisturize again. :) Your skin will thank you. I've always had problems with my face, from being too oily, to being too dry and everything in between(I have REALLY sensitive skin). I started using kyoku products about a year ago after my face broke out really bad and it has improved so much. The lava masque was about $30 the first time I bought it, the fact it's this cheap(I got it for around $13) is a steal. Buy this with the moisturizer, and use the moisturizer after a pat dry. Makes your skin feel pretty smooth.DO NOT, I repeat, do NOT use after shaving. It causes an irritating sensation. Shave on a day you won't use the masque and you'll save yourself a lot of irritation.For the current price, I would buy a few more to stock up, I do use every 2-3 days and it's a great product for me. Good product for the price. I used it for 10 minutes and I feel my face cleaner and less oily now. However, I will let you know if a miracle happen. Otherwise, do not expect more than you should from the product.I would recommend to use it before a shower or bath otherwise you risk to go around like the Phantom of the Opera with part of your face or neck white. I have oily skin and my skin doctor recommended me to exfoliate at least 1 to 2 times a week. I have tried facial scrubs but because of me sensitive skin I break out right after using any sort of scrub. I recently switched over to this facial mask and I got to say its one of the best mask I ever used. There's no awful smell and it goes on smoothly. It is a thick mask but you can feel it working almost instantaneously right after you put it on. You skin starts to tighten up and you just leave it on for 10 minutes and wash it off either in the sink or in the shower (recommended way since it can get quite messy). I have been using it for a couple months and though my skin is still oily its gotten better than before. A jar of the product can easily last over 2-3 months depending on how you use it. I'm definitely stocking up on theses! This is amazing stuff.  After the first use it reduced the overall look of pores and removed a lot if not all blackheads.  Does leave the skin a tight feeling which I like since it feels like my skin is clean and oil free.  My face is far less oily and shiny after a days work. It doesn't feel like I need to wash it right when I get home.  Oil doesn't seem to collect in my once large pores as the day goes on.  I only hope that it progresses and continues to work this efficiently.  So far I'm very impressed.  Just use a moisturizer afterward and your face will feel and look great. I have only used the product 2 times now because i think weekly use is the best for my skin type which is a little on the oily side but extremely sensitive to products...i did as directed and I loved it my face was tight clean and felt renewed. I would recommend getting a facial lotion because this def draws out all the oil dirt and even a little moisture so to balance that out as is good regimen anyway use a good lotion! I would highly suggest to friends and family and would buy it gain when im done This is great; it makes my skin feel clean and fresh for 8-9 hrs. and helps with razer burns as well. Tried many but this has to be the best for my skin. I have been using this product for about a month now, so far my skin looks and feels great. I used proactiv for years before this and it never really worked, still had constant break-outs. I was afraid to stop using it but it bleached my skin and all of my shirt collars. This product really helps get your face back to a healthy glow. It will clean and moisturize you face. It's a must have product for everyone. Seems to work clarifying the skin. I use it on my nose area. I found that it works best for me if I put it on at night and leave it on while I sleep. I have kept the plastic foil under the lid in place and I have had no problem with the product drying out. I shake the container a few times before I open it and its fine.  I'll see how this container works and than decide if its worth a re-order. Right now I like it. At first I was skeptical, since I know a lot of the product reviews are fake. However, I decided to take a chance on this masque based on other reviews from another site and I am glad I did. When I used the masque I had an acne breakout on the left side of my face so I used the masque as directed and the next day I started to notice they were disappearing. Now my skin feels smoother, tighter and I haven't had much of a problem since. This is a great purchase that actually works. as a guy.... putting this stuff on..... my roommate points at me ... laughs... and tries to post videos of me to his various social media outlets...but now... I have the better looking skin and as a result... more chicks.. :)Plus it REALLY relaxes you and takes tension away from your face...Thanks KYOKU you guys are awesome! I'm a 22 year old guy with large pores on my nose and forehead, both prime areas for breakouts that happen pretty often. I've tried a LOT of different products (Anthony for men, Clearasil, Neutrogena, proactive, etc), but this is the first to really do something.I use it twice a week and supplement with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VJTH8G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000VJTH8G&linkCode=as2&tag=gs025-20"">Anthony Logistics for Men Algae Facial Cleanser, 8 oz.</a><img src=""http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=gs025-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000VJTH8G"" width=""1"" height=""1"" border=""0"" alt="""" style=""border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"" > as a daily face wash.I'm more than half way done with it, but my skin is now getting compliments. My pores are smaller, I rarely see a pimple, and those stubborn black heads have disappeared. Well worth the price. This masque is excellent and your skin will be noticeably better after just the first use. Like others have mentioned it seems to help to leave it on a bit longer than kyoku recommends. I usually go about fifteen minutes but have gone as high as 30. It helps to clean off if you're in the shower as it is a bit more difficult to remove, and tends to leave a little residue on the face so it's not a bad idea to follow with a toner. This does reduce pore size as well as soften the skin and even out skin tone. I love this product, even my mom uses it and likes it...even though it's ""for men"". Some people have said there face has been left dry after using this. I can contribute to that statement, but only because I Used too much the first time. Also, even when it did slightly dry it out, I just added some crappy face lotion to my face, and in the morning I woke up with a baby's ass on my face, so SOFT. I will be using this as my face wash twice a week.. My acne has started going away, along with my blemishes. Maybe it's just a product for me that works so great, but give it a try for yourself.. This is only 13 bucks and for me the results have been amazing. Maybe they could be the same for you, give this stuff a try! Works great. Been using for few years now. Watch it close or your partner will likely steal it and use it while you are gone. love this stuff..it's pricey, but it only requires a small amount to apply each time Before bed, or early in the morning, I get the urge to look like a pale ghost for 10-or-so minutes. It's dry, hard and has a funny smell –– but I love using this. A little bit goes a long way, and I recommend it to anybody to get it. I'm sure it reacts differently with different skin types, but I've had no issues. When I run out, and there's no telling when that happens since it goes a long way, I'll be ordering some more. I don't know why more guys  have not  used this product. I personally have very oily skin and leave it on for 45 minutes before washing it off. From before I apply it to my face to the time I step out of the shower I can visibly see how much this product reduces redness and clears spots on my face. I have loved this product so much that I have bought more of Kyoku's products and would highly recommend this brand as a whole to anyone who has tried other products but have been unsatisfied with the results. Kyoku is a product for men and it shows in the performance of every product I have tried so far from smell to texture and performance. Hands down five stars.s Great product to use and easy to wash off. I recommend use it once to twice a week. First off, why is my name under allan? -.- damn amazon. Anyways, great product. My skin is less oily and feels refreshed. Only wish I got the moisturizer to follow it up. The scent isn't so strong. Washing it off was fairly easy, except a little got in my eyes, and I thought I had a vision of Pompeii. Bottom line, buy it if you don't have very sensitive skin (some reviews have reported irritation). Hope this helps :) This stuff is fantastic. Kyoku is the best stuff I have used. Highly recommend! I have tried several face masks and this is the first I have re-ordered. This does not ""stick"" in your pores and leaves your face feeling smooth and bright. I use 2x a week and get compliments all of the time. Best if used with a nice face-wash and moisturizer as well. Works great. Use it twice a week after cleanse with face wash. Makes my face smooth and much brighter, also I noticed much lesser breakouts but I cant justify that just yet. I think it can last forever even though it seems just little. Before application I shake it up vigorously and apply the paste thats on the lid of it ( well mixed and easy application). Hopefully it will work as efficient in the summer when my skin gets extra oily and clogged with dirt. Works well after shaving. Noticeably reduces oil and makes  skin visibly clearer. By far the best mask I have used thus far and the price is very good too. Kyoku overall seems to make excellent products. I have used both their scrub and facial moisturizer and think highly of both of them. I'd estimate this jar should last several months using it twice a week and I will definitely buy more. I'm quite impressed with thus masque.  I use a small amount and it seems to apply fairly evenly.  After about 10 mins, I rinse my face. There's a noticeable difference in the overall condition of my skin.  Can't describe the scent, but it's quite nice. This stuff works.  I love Kyoku products! Good stuff, washes of nicely.  Does the job. this face mask is awesome. I'm seeing the best results after I razor shave, since your pores are already opened, the mask does more of a job. If you use after shaving, make sure to wash the shaving cream off lol and rinse with warm/hot water.i use this 3 times a week. MWF. Cannot wait to try their other products!Gentlemen, dont be scared to take of your skin!!!! This masque makes my skin feel alive again. It has a wondefully rich and grainy texture. It smells good too. After using it my skin feels much healthier and firmer. I really believe in taking care of my face. So, I would like to say this product is essential to my grooming. As someone that has suffered from serious skin problems throughout my early years, I can honestly say this is the best facial mask I have ever used. Prone to acne, my skin can be finnicky when it comes to applying creams and masks, however, the Kyoku Lava Masque is without a doubt the most gentle yet cleansing and toning product I have encountered. Ordered on a whim, I couldn't be happier with it's refreshing scent, toning quality, and remarkable cleansing ability. My skin feels refreshed and brand new after using it! I will be a loyal Kyoku customer in the future, and am currently debating on trying their under eye cream for men as well. :D As a male, using this kind of stuff is kind of a weird thing. Though once you get past the feeling of ""why am I doing this, I'm not a chick."" you really have to admire how awesome this stuff is. I suffer from off and on acne, even in my mid-20's I get pimples. Using this once or twice a week helps solve that problem really well, as well as make your skin feel really nice in general. It's easy to put on, and mostly easy to rinse off. I thought this was a bit pricey when I bought it. But it goes a LONG way. I've had it for a couple months now. I use it once every two weeks. I let it sit on my face for probably 25 minutes(mostly because I end up watching a tv show or reading after I put it on). Washes off quite easily in the shower. Leaves my face feeling very ""new"" and clean. I love it. Will definitely purchase again. I use it from time to time, sometimes I have to dilute it with clean water, because the composition dries. Good quality, I recommend to buy. I LOVE THIS MASK- all I need to say.It is a little grainy in texture, but this is a mild abrasive to rid your skin of dead cells and such, leaving the mask to do it's work underneath. So I get the feeling that it buffs the skin and then goes to work!I leave it on a good 20-30 minutes, shower and rinse it off. Sometimes I leave it at that, but most times I will follow up with a moisturizer or balm.My face glows afterward & especially the next morning! I wrote my review for quite a bit of ""Kyoku"" products , and this product is a great one as well. - Smell , texture , and overall feel of the mask when you take it off is to die for. -  It's not to rough honestly you wouldn't think this is a man's product if you didn't know , but it sure does get the job done.5/5 I would purchase more when I get the chance ! I love it! keeps my face is smooth and rejuvenated! Is this withcraft!? This mask is awesome and practically wiped out amost all (and I had a lot) of the black heads I had on my nose and chin in the first use. I have spent a ridiculous amount of money on cleansers and masks and this is easily in the top 3 of my best list. I normally don't write reviews, but I just want to say that this was the BEST product I have got.  I ordered it just 2 weeks ago and it was shipped to my house a week later.  I bought the daily facial scrub and the  exfoliating facial scrub along with this product.  I only used this 2 times and I can already tell that my skin is definitely getting better. Rather than seeing immediate improvement in my skin the first time I used it, this mask made it better over a period of time. The effects are subtle but gradual -- I notice that my skin is smoother skin and that I have an overall better complexion. It's not a cure for acne or anything, but it helps. Using the mask also feels good too, in a mental-health/therapeutic kind of way. It goes in your face with a nice texture and ""clean"" smell (like the one used in expensive SPAs), and in about 5-10 minutes you remove with tap water and that's it. Remember to shake the container before you use it. At this price (I paid about $8) it's a steal and a must-have in any man's arsenal who has oil issues. Five stars. This product is amazing. Hesitant at first to  purchase having never used it before. Well worth the cost. Leaves skin feeling clean and clear. Caution it does tingle a bit. all i use is KYOKU products Been using this for the last 3 years now and love it! Make sure to follow directions and it will work it's magic. If you leave it for too long, it will dry out. I've found that wetting it with some warm water will give it back it's texture and can be used again. Burns like a SOB but it works This has got to be one of the most effective facial products I have ever bought. I apply it on the shower and let it sit for around 15 or 20 minutes before thoroughly washing it off. You can instantly see a difference when you remove the mask and the clean feeling it gives lasts for days. I use it once or twice a week depending on what my face is exposed to throughout the week. Fantastic masque - it has a cooling effect that is amazing. I wish it dried a little differently - it can get really flaky if you leave it on for >10 minutes, which I do (and recommend). At the price, this is a great product (and I'm a dermatologist!). Not only do you feel it work... you can see it work.You may get some pimples after your first few uses... this is NORMAL.It's the mask pulling out hidden oil and infections that were underneath your skin.They should die down after a day or so and slowly fade... you feel it! This is a great mask/scrub. You will only need to use this once a week, it's that good.  Leave on for 20-25 minutes for best results. my hubby likes Works as advertised. I have oily skin and it helps keep it less greasy. I love the smell. Like the price because it comes in a 5 ounce container the cost $20 when the most of the other masques come in a 3 ounce container and cost $25 - $30. Kyoku Rocks!  Love how smooth my face is after a good lava mask by Kyoku! This is magic in a little plastic tub, when you put it on for the first time it feels like it's burning but it's OK, it's just working and by the end of 10 minutes your face will thank you for it. Tried it for the first time this past Friday. All black heads and dead skin came out after my first use. Obviously once I start using this more it will make such a big impact. I will definitely recommend this ! I left it on for about 15-20 minutes. Its hard to take off so i took a shower. Put a moisturizer face lotion afterwards because it will leave your skin a little dry. I purchased this in the past to use as an occasional mask. I don't use it all that frequently because I don't like to use it when people are around (you look ridiculous). I used up my supply in about a year so I just bought another tub. I really like how it feels when you first put it on, it almost seems as though you can feel the gunk getting pulled out of your pores.Generally I'll use this after doing a cardio day at the gym to open my pores. When I get home I'll wash my face with an oil free cleanser (from Khiels, I can get the name if you're interested). I've found that the best results come after leaving the mask on for half an hour, washing my face in the sink (I haven't had any issues with clogging like some people report with a clay based mask), and then jumping in the shower to get the rest of the residue off. Generally I'll use a Biore Deep Cleansing Pore Strip on my nose after words to finish my routine.Overall I've been very happy with the product and haven't seen a need to try any other masks. After using this one my face feels freshened and cleared from a lot of the gunk i'm exposed to every day living in a city. Good mask...take the time to let it dry completely and you'll get a nice refreshing, tightening of the skin.  Seems slightly pricey for the amount you get however a little bit goes a very long way, you don't need to glop in thickly over your face, just spread thinly and evenly is all you need and it should go far. So I've tried quite a few masks so far, including icelandic glacial mud, Proactiv Sulfur mask, and the glamglow masks. While I think the glamglow masks have the best feeling afterwards, the Kyoku mask has the most immediate effect.I have pretty large pores but they all disappear for about 1-2 days after use of the Kyoku mask, and it leaves my skin tight and shiny. It doesn't seem to draw oils out like the other mud masks (glamglow, glacial mud) so perhaps it simply has a different utility. That being said, combined use of this with glamGlow is amazing and my skin has never been better.The kyoku mask has great immediate effects so I definitely recommend it if you want your face looking extra good for an event and you only have a few hours or a day to prepare. Pretty good product.  You will find that you need to add some water occaisionally I enjoyed the Kyoku masque a little too much.  I did it a couple of times a week.  That's how great this feels.  It really rejuvenates your skin and clears your pores.  It does not dry out your skin, rather it leaves it feeling moisturized.  It has just enough grit to exfoliate your skin when washed off and gives it a bit of a manly feel.  I'd say leave it on longer than recommended for the full effect - maybe 30 minutes. I've tried a number of facial masques for men over the years and this is one of the best. It is expensive but I think it's worth paying a little more for a product you are using on your skin. There seems to be some confusion about how the product should appear when you open it. First, mine had a sealed film under the lid, which should be intact when you receive it. When removed, the lava masque product was in a semi-solid moist square, surrounded by some liquid. This is normal. As stated on the container, you should not pour out this liquid. Instead, use a thin rigid stick or tool (or you can use your finger if you don't have anything handy) to stir the contents for about a minute. You will find that it will forms a nice consistency that will remain moist for a long time so long as you tightly screw down the lid after use.As to the performance of this masque, it goes on easily and a small amount gives decent coverage. It definitely tingles, which I like. A few reviewers commented that it burns; this wasn't my experience. If you actual find it painful, you may have very sensitive skin or perhaps you are allergic to the volcanic ash or other ingredients.  Once dried, it is best to remove it with warm water and a washcloth.This masque is rich in dozens of minerals and I have found that the mixture of volcanic ash and black sand makes for a deep cleansing. I have unique skin because I have very dry areas and also some very oily areas.  I have been using this once a week for a month and it has worked well.  My skin has evened out and no blemishes.  It has a small ""lava"" smell so you won't smell like fruit or perfumer after you use this.  If you put this on 10 minutes before you shower, it will easily come off while in the shower. I use this about twice a week along with a few other Kyoku products and I noticed an immediate improvement. I like it well enough to give it a 5 star review and definitely order it again. Works well for me with the scrub and wash. Kinda tingles but I like it. I use this 1 or 2 times a week and this stuff really works great! I had awful acne as a teen and have minimal scaring and this stuff helps reduce appearance while eliminating blackheads and redness!ALSO, after purchasing I found this stuff to be on alot of mens best face masks lists (GQ,OUT) so there has to be something to it! I have been using clay masks for a while since Im kind of old.  I switched from Zinh to Anthony, and I thought Anthony was the best.  I was wrong!  Kyoku is the best.  Anthony masks are orange and stain everything.  Kyoku is white and washes off easily.  The lava really improves the mask as well. I love this masque. It feels great and it cleans up your pores nicely. It does tingle a little, but it does not hurt. I recommend it! I love this masque. I've never used one before this, but I now have no reason to look. I love the way it makes my face feel and it washes off very easily. Seems to work-pores are tightening. Leave face feel clean and smooth to the touch. The burn tells me it's working and I'm not annoyed by it as some other are. Great overall product and will buy again. good stuff. I use this once a week and my skin is softer and not as oily. Great mask. Just your average guy that needed to start taking better care of my skin. Leave my face feeling clean. My girlfriend tried it and says that sometimes it stings a bit but I like this mask a lot. Use weekly, definitely feel a difference after each use. Works great Makes my skin feel amazing and totally keeps me from breaking out....It is FANTASTIC for after a shave because it reduces all inflammation and redness. I've been using this for a little while now and I must say that I love using it. Application is easy and it washes off relatively easily as well. Well worth the price. I was extremely skeptical about paying this much for a male face mask product, but the other reviews convinced me it was worth trying.  I have had moderate to severe acne for ten years now (it is much better now than when I was a teenager).  Using this product twice a week for 10-15 minutes at a time has removed so much oil from my face and made my skin feel much smoother than I can even remember.  All of the little bumps that used to form seem to have disappeared, and the large ones are disappearing as well.  This product has helped clear up my face, prevented new breakouts, and it makes my face feel so cleansed.  It is definitely worth the price! You can feel the mask working as soon as you put it on. I've tried several different maskes from several different brands but this hands down works the best. Buy this crap and get to smearing it all over your face asap. Been using it for 2 weeks and im impressed with skin its smoother and lightend, I recommend this product if you want a clear look. A perfect face cleaner. Doesn't over dry my skin. I will be looking for more of their products in the future. I use a lot of facial beauty products and I thought this mask smelt pretty nice. After you apply it, it has a nice pasty and crisp feeling when you leave it on for 5-10 mins. It leaves your face smooth and dry once you remove it too. Definitely worth a try! Good product.  Help clear my acne. This mask is amazing. I have very sensitive skin and get many ingrown hairs under my chin. In 10 minutes this mask clears everything up and leaves the rest of my face feeling buttery smooth. Add a little water with it and bam...amazing product. I use with L'oreal Rivtalift because this will dry your face to the bone. I bought this for my husband and he loves it.  He is a chef and with the heat and cooking oils in the kitchen, his face gets pretty beaten up.  The very first time he used the lava masque, his skin was visibly smoother.  Well worth the money.  Like my aunt says ""you pay, you get"". Works as described good! Noticeable difference with my skin This is the best product I have used to clear my oily, blackhead laden forehead and nose. Excellent product, easy on my skin and makes my skin look and feel great. Worth the price! I bought this based upon a recommendation in an article. It seems to do a pretty good job - I've used it once a week for the last few weeks and have noticed that my skin is less oily. i will probably buy this product again. This stuff is great! I buy almost all of the Kyoku Products! it does burn a bit on my face (Not in a bad way), but it makes my skin feel clean and soft. This stuff really seems to work to even out my complexion. The effects don't really last all that long; I usually look about the same after a couple days. I have noticed fewer breakouts since I've started using it, so maybe it also helps keep skin clear in between uses. Would definitely buy again! I love this stuff. My skin has never been so smooth and blemish free Bought this product last year and it has lasted me until now (used about once a week).I received the package and I THOUGHT it was dried out. I was expecting something creamy. What I did was I would scoop out a dime sized amount into my hand and cupped my hand. Then I would put a FEW drops of water and diluted it. My face doesn't like when product is caked up. This formed a nice watery paste, and I applied it all over my face. As it dried up it didnt look as transparent and it dried up nice. The small granules in this mask helped prep my face for the drying stage by giving it some exfoliation (Note: do not SCRUB HARD when applying. Any type of harsh exfoliation, as cleansing as it may feel, CAN destroy capillaries on your face. When scrubbing, apply LIGHT pressure. That is more than enough to exfoliate. You're only exfoliating the outer surface of skin, so no need to press hard while exfoliating). After washing off the mask and patting my face dry, my face felt so soft and clean. Did not break me out, and the tub and packaging is cute. This is an excellent product. I have had many bad nights after using masks that did not do what they were supposed to, but this was not one of them. After rinsing the mask off you can visibly see a clearer face. This is by far the best mask that I have ever used and I would recommend it to anyone!!! Love it. My face feels incredibly smooth after using it. Great Product! Once a week set aside 10 minutes to give your skin some much needed TLC this is my favorite masque so far and much more affective than my home made attempts with coffee grinds and egg whites. The masque removes dead skin, promotes cellular regeneration, unclogs even fine pores while reducing and evening out oily to dry areas which unless you where touched by god yes you have both on one face most of the time. Looking good is not only a smart thing professionally and health wise it shows in your confidence and self worth you carry yourself in a better way if you know you have put a bit of effort in and since now days we are all held to a higher standard of beauty than our dads and grand dads don't try to ask them for advice on it. The days of bars of soap being enough for men are gone along with prejudicial marriage and race riots so do your girl/ guy a favor and try half as hard as she/ he does or less First time using anything of the sort. Pleasantly surprised. It really does make noticeable improvement and not too much fuss. I love this mask. It works well and rinses off very easily as opposed to many other masks I've used. Big fan. Great product leaves face feeling fresh and very clean I loved, love, and still am in Love with this product! Works as expected and even better! I use it once a week and its lasting awhile but probably will buy another one coming up My skin feels fantastic after using this.  Definitely will be buying again. Love this stuff.  My face feels and looks great after using it. Great product used it for several years.. Deep cleans leaves skin looking great. I use it twice a month. Love this mask as a spot treatment. I'd fry my face trying to use it all over for more than 8 seconds (I have sensitive baby skin), but this made blemishes disappear overnight. Best product This stuff was so effective at pulling the oil out of my skin it kind of caught me off guard.  I went into it thinking that maybe after several uses I might notice some effect but this is far from the case.  Shrinks pores, mattes skin immediately. Perfect LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! This product is amazing, it reduces dark marks and acne appearance. The only down side is I can only use the product twice a week because it does dry your skin a little. I will definitely buy another! The sensation is very odd - warms up, slightly tingly, but after using as directed, I definitely had cleaner, smoother skin. Not sure about leaving it longer than as directed though, as other reviewers mentioned - may have side effects? I haven't had too many masques in the past to compare this with, but I love it anyway. My face looks and feels much cleaner, less oily, and younger after each use. Plus it's made from lava, which is clearly awesome. Will be buying it again! Amazing results from day one This has greatly improved my skin it works great I would defenetly buy again Love this masque because of how good your skin feels after using it. I recommend leaving it on for about 20 to 30 minutes, and only using a fingertip amount. I use it weekly and it's great! I'm a lady, but this is the best clay mask I've ever used. You can feel it work and it's more effective than my red or green clays. I've used the entire bottle and ordered another. Works great. Love this product!  I found that it speeds up the processes of clearing up those lingering post-blemish marks.  Smells great too! Tried my wife's scrubs in the past (at her request) but this one feels great without smelling like a woman.  Love these mens products from Kyoku. Doesnt feel like it'll over dry out my skin when I use it. Skin texture feels a lot smoother (after the whole exfoliate, cleanser, mask) session. I use it twice a week for maintenance and it seems to work pretty well to get all the gunk out. In your 40's trying to reverse time. It's doing it for me. Get the exfoliater, cream and facial mask. Look younger in a week. Won't do miracles, but if you look good and want improvement this could be what your looking for. Very Good Its a great product . It lifts stubborn black heads right out really good stuff. Very cooling effect on your skin and smells good. I've used others and i like this one more because it's got exfoliating beads in it, and it is good for oily skin. This stuff is amazing. I have sensitive oily skin and apply this twice per week the day after a shave. The moment I put it on I can feel the fires of Hell rising up from the earth through a dark and clouded mountain and pouring lava into my pores. It digs deep, burns away all the crap beneath the surface, and leaves my face clean and amazingly smooth afterwards.DON'T USE IT RIGHT AFTER SHAVING. Ouch. Seriously. amazing !!! I have very oily skin and use this mask once a week although I could probably use it more often. Has a nice smell and a little bit goes a long ways. This jar will last forever using once or twice a week. Very easy to wash off unlike some masks I have used. I like it a lot Leaves a baby face feel. Great calming and clean scent Only need to use twice a week, easy to use, and it does what it says. Depending on your skin type add or subtract time from how long you leave it on your face. I use several KYOKU products and this is my favorite. The mask is perfect for cleaning out pores and tightening wrinkles. I can actually see a noticeable difference after each use.The mask itself needs to be stirred before using because it tends to separate from the water but if you mix it properly, it goes on smoothly. Once the mask is applied, it will dry in about 10 minutes. At that point, it crumbles off and you can rinse your face. Minoring tingling occurs during use but it feels refreshing. It leaves the face a little dry so I follow this mask with the KYOKU daily facial moisturizer.INGREDIENTS:Water, Kaolin, Sorbitol, Titanium Dioxide, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Calcium Carbonate, Pumice, Tropiaca Starch, Hydroxypropylmethyl Cellulose, Sea Salt, hydrolyzed Algin & Zinc Sulfate, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Gylcol Ethlhexylglycerin, Hexylene Gylcol, Fragrance, DMDM Hydantoin, Iron Oxide Black, Mica, Methyclchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone.I would HIGHLY recommend at least trying this product if you are looking at different face masks. This is one of the best and for the price, you can't beat it anywhere else! I love it I use this every once in a while to smooth out my skin. Love it cool I love this. My face is clearer I have been using this masque off and on for 3-4 years.For my part, it's one of the best men's products available. Love this product, second time using it! I am surprised there is not more reviews for this product. This is the best mask I have ever used before. It really makes a difference in how my face looks and feels. My pores are visibly smaller and over all my skin looks fantastic. It also smells amazing. Highly recommended. Wow that's what I can use to describe this product. Great for oily skin. Saw the effect the same day he used it and hes still using it. the only thing is that when u stop (for a week) you get oily face back . I have to say, I was pretty skeptical going in. I've tried many different facial products that haven't really ""proven themselves,"" i.e not lived up to expectations. The majority of products out there, to me, simply don't really do all that they're advertised to do. That wasn't the case with this (I bought two Kyoku products--this, and the pore reducing serum. I would not recommend the pore reducing serum because I do not believed it really worked, i.e no noticeable difference). It's not going to change your life by any means, but I definitely noticed my face is clearer the next day after using this product. The product goes on very even, and you don't really need a lot to spread over your face (I see it lasting a long time). It burns slightly when putting it on, but not a bad burn. It's reminiscent of the old adage ""if it burns, it's working.""Two of the most important things that I look for in a review is if the customer liked the product, and if they'd be willing to buy it again. I most definitely liked the product, and I will definitely be buying again. Love it! This stuff works! I've been using it for about a month and holy cap it works! Makes my skin feel and look much much better. Great stuff..... feels good and really draws out the impurities Excellent product that seems to really improve the health and appearance of skin. Definitely ordering again when i run out Looks like working for me As others have stated, this is an excellent masque that exfoliates. Instructions say to use for 10 minutes, I use for 15-20 minutes. Quality product. This is one of the best masques I've ever used.  I like how my face looks and feels after using this. What can I say? My face can be quite oily & this takes care of that! I love it. I use it once to twice a week. Nice little tingle and my face feels smooth and refreshed. Definitely recommend. I always wondered if a product is as good as the reviews you read, and this one is. It really makes your skin feel like it never felt before and is easy to use. Best thing I have found. I had very dry flakey skin. This has made me have a refreshing feeling and no longer dry and flakey. I highly suggest this product to any guys out there looking to improve their skin. I've only been using it for a few weeks but i can see a difference. From the scent and texture to the firm pull as it dries this stuff is great.  After just a couple of uses my skins oil seems much more controlled and my skin just feels better.  Definitely will buy again. this stuff is amazing!!!! great Product came on time, as described. No complaints. Great product. Will buy again. This product is really great . To start with i have an oily skin. I I dint have any regime except washing my face twice daily ;) . I started noticing dead, dull skin which looked like scaly and enlarged pores.so my wife suggested to use some face products. I did some online search as a normal geek and found this amazing product.I say it as amazing beauce its simple to apply, takes max 15 mins for the entire process and results are seen immedeately.after my first use i noticed my shink was brighter and fresh . i noticed the second day that my forehead skin looked renewed. After the second and third use the difference was evident. my skin looked younger, pores lesser .another best part is it takes off all the black heads on you nose if any.a great product and worthy every penny !!! .easy to use, fast results and free from harsh chemicals. smells great.  My wife started hitting on me again ;) lol The very next day, someone commented on how youthful my appearance was to them! It's eh.....nice Once you try it, you will love it. Your skin feels great. Just have to get over feeling like a woman with a mask on. Great thank you! Works GREAT!. Starts to tighten/harden in a few minutes. Rinses easily. Great product! I swear this product is like magic!!! I will be ordering more and telling everyone i know about it. Thanks! this is a lovely men face masque at the great pricekeep it up great stuff but don't use it if you have sensitive skin. Also this product isn't for wimps. It stings like a b**** on your face. I shouldn't be complaining this stuff works great go get it. I have been using this product twice per week for a few weeks now and I can tell that my overall complexion is so much clearer than it has been.  I haven't been getting nearly as many breakouts.  Skin looks fresh and clear. Good experience! This is my second time buying this. Purchased Great product Bought the entire Kyoku line but this is definitely my favorite product. It does everything the product States and makes your skin glow. I do recommend mixing the contents with a stick (like a waxing stick, to avoid contamination from your hands) because the liquid dose separate from the clay. If you apply the mask while it is separated it is hard to put on and it seems to dry out before it has had time to work properly. This stuff is amazing! My skin feels like a marshmallow and looks vibrant after using this product. Works like its advertised !! This stuff is amazing !! Buy it now it will not disappoint me skin will look flawless I gave it 5 stars because is good product that can help the skin a lot. i've been using it for a year now and there is positive changes in the skin. Kyoku Men's Lava Masque is a product that actually does what it claims to do.An excellent product which rates always having a back-up jar on hand. After several weeks of use my face cleared and pimple free. Best Masque around, I feel good, clear, and healthy! This product leaves my face refreshed and brightened.  I would recommend to anybody.  I've had over a month and love the results. Face feels amazing after this stuff Feels good, as advertised. I don't have a lot of acne, and I don't even have a particularly oily (on the surface) face. However I do have a bit of excess oil in the pores themselves. This product essentially draws that oil out of your face which you should then wipe off. It's not acne, or liquid oil, it's just the stuff that everyone has in their pores. When you have too much it builds up and can turn into a black head/acne if it gets infected. It's a pretty obvious improvement in my case and my pores definitely look smaller (the actual pore doesn't change, but it is no longer ""stretched"" to maximum capacity with oil.Honestly a good portion why I enjoy this product is that it makes my face feel amazing afterward. Extraordinarily smooth and ""cool"". It is a bit expensive for what essentially amounts to some volcanic ash and salt, but hey, if it works well it works well (and it lasts a while too). Awesome product, feels fresh after every wash with skin looking great and smooth. recommended this for every men out there best stuff Bought this in summer of 2013 and still use it! Put it on about once a week and it smooths everything out on your face. Thick product Brilliant value product Its really cleans your face. Love the tingling bite of this mask. Awesome - Deep cleans! Great Absolutely as described and more! Everyone who's on the fence try this now! You will not be disappointed at all! recommended by my friends good Incredible product! Definitely made the purchase worthwhile with excellent service and delivery. Good exfoliant takes just a very little to cover entire face. I like it and I use it often. Makes my skin feel refreshed, clean, and smooth. This is the first face masque I've tried so  I cannot compare with others.  It feels great afterwards though!  Fast shipping and arrival as well. Awesome price, great product Great for reducing pore sizes! Essential Makes my skin feel very smooth and freshGreat buy! You can honestly FEEL it working as you put it on. It's probably best to use it right after a hot shower, but wow it's great! I love this product.. you can feel it burning after putting it on...my skin is smoother after about 2 weeks of using it Great - we both use this - smooth and works well Works great and helps to keep facial oil down. Great Seller.Fast Shipping A++++ so good~ Cleans face, leaves a smooth clear face afterwards. Good product. Great face mask i think it works well and makes skin soft So far so good, applies and rinses well, no complaints the best great great ok mmmm LOVE IT Great product This stuff i awesome! My husband love it Liked it what it offers with the price. love it! Pulls the dirt out of my pores. On time and great product...... Amazing product! Prior to trying this I had never used a face mask.  I chose this brand after surfing around and realizing that I didn't know what I was looking at/for. I used this product once or twice a week and noticed improvement after a couple of uses.  Be sure you apply to your skin while still damp to avoid problems spreading it around. I usually left in on for about 30 minutes and then washed of with warm water while gently scrubbing in circles. Follow up with a moisturizer and your face will feel great!Better looking skin, smaller pores, great fresh feeling afterwards. Would both purchase again and recommend. Decinitely worth the money spent. awesome stuff! Love it Great face mask! this is the best product I have found for my face. I would recommend and I will be buying again."
B0064HDGBI," I used this product for a year now. It washes out make up and moisturizing skin. I've been using this product each morning, and I've been super impressed so far! It doesn't dry out my skin, which is the most important thing to me, and some of the blemishes I have chronically had have started to go away. It's also a lot cheaper than other brands of face wash. Got it for my boyfriend because he wasn't happy about his acne and redness. The first time he use it, his face got really soft!! After a few weeks, I see that his redness has minimize and look more healthy than before. Great product! I can feel the softness of my skin and clean after using it. Im gonna purchase again after finishing the one i've got.I think it will last long, im just using a small amount everytime i use it and result was great. This is an amazing face wash. I don't think I will switch back to anything else. I might have to buy the entire kit after using this product. Your face will feel tighter after just one use. A little bit goes a long way and I really like how it cleanses my face without drying out my skin. I love the feel of my skin after using this product.  Smells great also. Smell very good and clean well This is the most wonderful facial cleanser I've ever used.  I'm 61 years old and I've tried many.  It's organic and it lasts about 8 months.  You use a small pearl sized amount on wet hands and lather it up - I use it morning and night - I won't use any other! Best face wash, been using for years now! Never use soap on my face. Excellent Product. Cleans well and smells good. I use it every night in the shower and it makes my face feel so much smoother and cleaner! Love it!  Been using for a few years now! My favorite cleanser ever! A little goes a very long way! Creamy and foamy at the same time! Highly recommend, repeat purchaser My favorite cleanser of all time. Just takes a small amount& lather into a gentle foam that cleans thoroughly. I love this cleanser. It's super soft on your face. Not harsh at all. My boyfriend is hooked on it. Love atomy skin products i love it My wife always asks me to buy this so it must be a 5. Wear it everyday now! nice Everything Good!! Really good stuff. Now I  only use this one. I think this is my 6th bottle of this.  For a pinch of soap, it llathers your whole face.  Nice gentle product, does the trick! Great! Excellent face wash! My sun very like. A couple family members have been using this, so I thought I'd try it.  I LOVE it.  I squeeze out less than a pencil-eraser size for my face....a little goes a LOOOOOOONG way. Cleans effectively but gentle. My favorite face wash.  The most effective perfect face wash for my skin. It smells great and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. this is an excellent product and you just need to use a very small amount.  It goes a long way and last for weeks.  I will certainly buy again.  Best foam cleanser I have ever purchased. I was introduced this product from one of my friends. It make my skin feel very clean and smooth. I have combo skin and it doesn't irritated my skin. amazing how little you use to bring up a lather.  feels great on skin My husband bought this Atomy Evening Care Foam (bought as a set 4 each) a few months ago, I love it so much, my feeling so clean, so smooth, healthier and looking younger, the price a lot cheaper than any other brand name products in the market, I recommended you all buy from Atomy website is cheaper and 100% guaranteed, all you have to do is become a member to receive bigger and better discounts on most products, register is free, for more information contact us at Atomychan64@gmail.com.

Love this - works great. First received as a gift.  Super clean feel without drying. Great face wash. Seen the result after the couple days of having it! Very fast delivery! Love it! Great product! very good Great product"
B00DTHJWD2," This stuff is nothing short of amazing! I love this moisturizer. I feel like it has made my skin look younger since I have been using it. This moisturizer is a must. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. The PUR brand was recommended to me when I visited an Ultra store and discussed changes in my skin with an Esthetician. I was in my mid-thirties and the flawless skin I took for granted, was becoming very dry and I was experiencing adult acne pimples on my cheeks and chin. I have been using this moisturizer 1-2x a day for 3 years. I can't go without it.  I have downgraded other items in my makeup/skin routine depending on finances/modd etc and this is one that I won't consider swapping out. I have also tried the other ""soak it up"" moisturizer and I find the yellow tint and more gelatinous texture off-putting. ""Get A Lift"" is light enough to use daily. It also works great with thePur Minerals in the Clear Clarifying Cleanser and the 4 in 1 Powder (I won't swap this powder either btw) PS- It is Vegan too so you can feel good about choosing it... This review is way overdue...this stuff is absolutely the BEST face cream I have ever used! I used it before for a few months and ran out, but didn't buy more. I ended up using a cream from Olay that is very good just didn't give me the glow that I got from this one. I bought more again yesterday from Kohl's and went to sleep last night with it on. I woke up with the most glowing, young looking skin I have had in a long time! Your skin literally soaks this stuff up!! I will not be switching back anytime soon.. I love this cream and it is worth every penny!! I'm not the type of person to buy everything from one brand, meaning all my products are one brand. Usually it's pretty mix and match based on what I like. However, I tried this cream instead of my regular cream, followed by the pur primer and all in one powder that I always use and I was surprised to find that it does seem to make a difference. The primer and powder all seem to go on smoother when I'm using this face cream first instead of the other lotions or creams that I like.Some folks have mentioned they don't like the scent - it's a citrus & lavender scent that I find really nice. It's really mild compared to others I like/use and I find it calming/pleasant. I suppose if you're not into citrus or lavender you should pass this one by. I love this face lotion,  I can't live without it. The packaging is so beautiful , and this face lotion is so moisturizing and a little goes a long way. It smells so amazing. I have tries everything out there and this is by far the best face lotion and a amazing brand. I have been using this for a month now. And it has become one of my favorites. leaves face feeling amazing. My face looks more toned. I have received compliments. I use this along with my pro-active+ face wash I love this stuff.  It goes on smooth and moisturizes without being waxy or heavy.  I used it in my hair also.  I would use it full body if it weren't so expensive. ;) I've only been using for a few days but I absolutely love this moisturizer!!! My face loves this moisturizer!! I have acne prone skin and fear trying new products but I feel like I've finally found a quality moisturizer.  I just want to keep putting it on my face all day. feels great on.  Tried this product from recommendation of my sister. Like it so much that I have recommended it to friends and family. Love this product!  My skin is so soft and the cream is very light weight!"
B0037H83AW," I love this. It's great for adults too. Use it every day to keep my skin fresh and smooth. Love this brand of skin products! Very gentle and feels like it really cleans with out over drying or irritating. Some other reviews said it smells funny. I disagree, it's a natural smell and slightly citrus.... Refreshing and simple. You don't want fragrance on your face, especially if your having acne issues. My teen daughter was given a sample of the cleanser and moisturizerafter a facial and she really liked it.  Her skin is much more clear, no redness or dryness from other acne products.  Highly recommend. I love this face wash!  Perfect for a gentle effective facial scrub cleaner. Love this product.  I have adult acne and it helps to eliminate dark spots.  It is a very good exfoliate. I've been using this face wash for mild acne for years and love it! I'm not a teen, but this product works for all ages. I have very picky skin that breaks out no matter what I do and this product gets rid of blemishes and keeps them away. The smell is a little funky but it is worth it! Been in love with this product for years! Received it so quickly too, thanks!! I have been using this product now for 3 yrs. and at 54 yrs. of age, can say it's the best product I have used for my skin.  I give it a two-thumbs up!!"
B0776X974M," It worked great for me -removed all annoying black heads around my nose and forehead .it has few different heads -for massaging and firming ,for corners around the nose and couple more .. The machine is the perfect consistency it is not watery like the ones o have used previously. Overall I am completely satisfied with this Directions are sparse- I suggest looking online for tips prior to using!I bought this being VERY skeptical- I have always had a lot of black heads on my nose and chin and as quickly as I would pop them they would return. Using this product the first few days the breakouts seemed worse and then my skin was clearer than it had been in years. I use a good wash and moisturizer. I took two weeks off thinkingnit was just the cleanser helping and the black heads returned. I went back to using this product and again worse then better. I use this machine every other day and notice the best results after washing with very warm to hot water - the different suction setting helps- I did leave a small “hickey” on my jaw the first time using as I was new to using it but it cleared quickly. This vaccume is useful for my husband's nose when we use the strongest suction. He has acne for long time. And the dirts on face always jam in his skin. This vaccume cleans his skin and protect it from acne. I purchased this facial pore cleaner because of the many blackheads I have on my nose. The cleaner functions even better than I expected and is really simple to use. Checked a lot. And then finally got this one. I like this pinky color. And it comes with 4 different sucking head. And I tried a already. It’s perfect It's a good product, better than I thought it would be, and the skin will be smoother after use, and I'll stick with it for better results. I just got this a week ,try many time to use ,this can help you to clean nose, 4 different sucking head, power very strong comfortable Cool product. I use it to suck my blackhead on my nose, and it works(but not perfect). It has 5 different level, I recommend the 5th level, it's powerful. Easy to operate and interchange different attachments. It minimized the pain and skin damage from cleaning blackheads. bought this for my wife to use, its pretty simple product, and works as described, cleans the pors on the face and it is rechargeable and also very light.. pretty good product for the price. It is a wonderful facial pore cleaner with good quality. It is useful to suck the blackhead on my nose. Received parcels like very nice to be able to clean blackheads on nose This is a very wonderful design! It can clean most of blackheads. It is very easy to use.also very comfortable to suck blackheads on nose out.So good! Very comfortable to use，Go quickly to blackheads，It is also very convenient to use My skin feels softer, cleaner and looks brighter. It is easy to use and I can already see the beginning of old marks fadin away. I would definitely recommend this to a friend! yes we really loving this product. Works great thank you I already own a similar pore suction device but it broke because I let it under the water, which I should not have 😔 I got this one from Suntak cus the price is cheaper and the reviews seem to suggest it works as well as my last one.  Well, I’m glad that I got this.  It works better than the previous one that I had because it has more strength or power settings.  There is only one button to turn it on or off and adjust the strength settings. There are 5 strength settings.  For 1, I would use on my cheek area, because I really don’t want to bruise my cheeks.  I would use 3 on my nose, where there are more blackheads and grease to be sucked up.  I do see grease or “blackhead debris” being sucked up.  They tend to gather around the surface of the suction head.  That is how I know this does its job.  I appreciate how the device comes with three sets of replacement filters and rubber rings.  I have not have to replace them yet so I’m sure they’ll last for a while. Excellent product!  You will see the sebum, blackheads and white wriggly worms being sucked out of your pores! Don't use too often as it bruises slightly and obviously keep that in mind if you have an event coming up. I saw comments about suction being too weak and too strong. Personally I only use first level for my nose area and second level for the chin and I think the suction is just right. Best of all, no battery required. Great product and love it. Very easy to use,I am reviewing after using them for a while. After using it a couple times a week, I can actually see the impurities like whiteheads literally get sucked out of my pores.I can say, they are amazing. I highly recommend to someone looking forward to buy. I feel my nose very clean, and this product quality are excellent so worth it. The different tips/nozzles have different size holes to use depending on which area you are wanting to cleanse. The small holed head is used for hard to reach areas, like the sides of your nose. The larger holed one are used on areas like the chin, forehead. There is one tip/nozzle that has a silver top which massages and helps exfoliate the skin removing the dead skin cells and smoothing the skin. It comes with around 8 filters which you can change if one gets dirty, and it is very easy to clean after use but running under water. This makes the machine hygienic. I would recommend that you only use it for yourself and not the whole family, it is something like a toothbrush, it is for your own personal use. I would recommed it to people with big pores and blackheads.pores, you can also use this device after shower or steaming My face is just as soft as my baby cousin's face so I'd advise anybody to use the soft brush. Even if your skin is as tough as a moose's knuckle. Okay maybe not but it's a tough brush just feel excited to open it and try it. I'm amazed at how strong the suction power . it's very powerful even at the weakest power setting. My face felt a little tender afterwards but the redness/discomfort went away after 15 minutes. it helps you to clean out the oil and blackheads in pores and get better absorption of cosmetics. Can not suck out all the blackheads one time but can clear most of the blackheads. Anyway, I am quite satisfied with it. I like it. you can see the white stuff that would be in a pimple in the head of the suction cup, even if you don't have a pimple it literally vacuums is your face clean and gets everything out before you even have a chance to break out This is a very nice complete set. The quality of the tools is impeccable. This package comes with instructions so you know which tool is for what purpose I was a little skeptical at first, but this works great. Much easier than squeezing all of your pores.It works best after a shower or if you have steamed your face did deeply clean and remove impurities while maintaining skin's moisture balance.The tip is gentle touch,move smoothly around the place need to clean. Got this for my wife so she can try and remove black heads, I does a great job of sucking the black head out and top it off with the UV lights. I can feel totally clean and cool on the face. My pores appear looks smaller after sevaral times using.I've definitely sure my skin will looks better as I keep using this. I have just used this product for the first time and as really pleased with the results For remove the black head very useful! That is very good for deep clean skin! Not only do they work well but they are safe on my skin and don't cause craters or scars after using My blackheads aren't the sort that are easily pulled out, they're pretty much just blocked pores to be honest. But where I had little grease plugs, this thing managed to pull them much nearer to the surface, ready to be wiped away or plucked out with tweezers It has awesome suction power and definitely does the job. I highly recommend. Nicely.What comes out of this is truly gross just just the bridge of my nose almost made me puke. . this is a marvellous kit,got rid of some problems, money well spent thanks I saw results straight away after the first time. My skin actually feels really clean After using this suction remover it is easy to clean the top with warm water ready for you to use it the next time .. we have tried many ways to remove blackheads and so far this is the only one that worked. It came with several replacable heads which is really usefull as each head has different function. Its easy to clean and use which is perfect for me as a busy person. Love it! also its nicely packed in a box so would be a perfect gift It works well for removing my stubborn and blackheads. Painless use and effectively. Very professionally looking happy with quality Will be using this on a regular basis to keep my skin clear! And my skin feels soo smooth! Very good value for money and does the job Great product highly recommended. I bought this both for it's cleansing pores tools and also for my son to help remove blackheads in a non-abrasive way. I like the fact that there are different tools for different tasks. It comes with all bits and bobs needed.it includes machine, four heads and usb cable. Nice design, comfortable to hold in hand and easy to use I have been using this product for few months now and can see major difference. Alot of my blackhead have disolved This cleansing and blackhead removal is really powerful! When received i was really delighted as the packaging looked really girlish and pinkish ( I just looove pink!) Ordered this for my partner who has open and visible pours around his T-zone, after using it once it was evident that it had cleared oily skin an not left spots dry. Amazing love it, have recommended this to friends Easy to use and already charged. Different heads for different areas. Found a considerable difference on my nose and cheeks in particular where I suffer from large blocked pores. perfect, the one and only that does what promised, a deep clean feeling ! The suction is MUCH higher without any attachment, and it brought an embarrassing amount of goo out of my face. Using this method might not be a good idea I've had others that have only made my face feel oily and or dry. I really like that this blackhead remover machine I have naturally oily skin and blackheads are the bane of my existence so I find this little gadget to be helpful. ust open your pores before using it and you will see everything coming out. With regular use I'm sure it will reduce the size of the pores and keep it clean. I love the tingly sensation this product gives when I wash my face with it! I have seen a massive improvement in the texture of my skin. I am really happy with the result and quality of the unit. It's really useful for skin. I would definitely recommend it. I use it about twice a week after a shower. Gets that sebum and gunk. Would definitely recommend. Just wish it was a bit more powerful my family said why have I ordered a dildo? and yes I recommend it this would be a good product for people that have lots of blackheads as it removes all of them in 1 use I’ve only just used it and I can already see the difference. It works well so far, I only use it once a week easy application and clearly saw a difference when removing this device it's really good on sensitive skins and makes your face feel fresh and clean It has a strong suction, strong enough to clean without hurting your skin. It works best on the nose I've found but anywhere even the back would work This product is very useful and is very relaxing to use on my face Very good for clearing up the skin"
B00UOLC6TI," I love this face wash! I use it everyday and it leaves my face feeling fabulous and clean! Works well! My 14 year old daughter requested this for her acne prone face. She said several other girls her age use it and she wanted to try it. So glad she did. She is very happy with this product and the way it makes her face feel, and keeps her acne at bay. I tried it just to see how it felt and was impressed with how clean it left my skin. I didn't feel a residue and loved the tingly feeling on my skin. I would recommend this for young girls who need a face wash they can use every day. My daughter keeps it in the shower and says it is quick and easy to use. works just fine I've been using this cleanser for well over a decade...I have very sensitive skin, and this is the most powerful cleanser I've been able to use that doe not irritate my skin. Tried my true and all I will use. One of two face washes I use and it helps quite a lot especially if you cannot use soap. My favorite face was Feels great and cleans my face well Exactly as advertised Great product, as usual. Best product for everyday face cleaning. I especially use it in the summer and after working out Good Nice product, used it for a long time Great face wash. It really gets down deep into my pores and makes my skin feel clean. It's even cleared up the little sebum bumps that I had on my chin! Clean and Clear products are the only thing I will use on my face. The deep cleanser makes my skin feel so fresh and minty."
B00Q5V41NK," I purchased this product a couple days ago and I already received it with my prime shipping. I absolutely LOVE how this mask feels going on my skin and the feeling after. Even after one use I can already tell it has helped clear out the impurities in my pores and leaves my skin feeling SO soft, smooth and tight! (Which who doesn't love that?!)  I will definitely be ordering more for Christmas. What a perfect gift!! I've only used the MegaMud twice and I'm already addicted to it.  I'm very picky about my beauty products and this is a winner.  It feels great while it's on and then once it's rinsed off, I feel like my skin feels smoother and younger.  I'm really excited to keep using it and seeing further results.  Stay tuned for my update! This stuff is awesome! I have sensitive skin that is a little bit oily. I've gone through a whole tub and I'm about to get more. I love watching this product dry onto my face and see all of the oily dots appear where I'm most oily. Sometimes, just so it lasts longer, I just put it on my T-zone and on my nose. However, one tub still lasts months because you only need a thin layer per use. This is the one product that I will absolute splurge on. Worth the cost. I have not found anything better. Love LOVE this Product! I have very oily skin and also suffer from minor rosacea, I use this mask at least once a week to keep my skin looking awake and tight. it has visvaly reduced the amount of oil and redness on my skin from frequent use. This is a great mask.  Very firming and clarifying.  It's the foundation of my skincare routine.  Until recently, I went to monthly professional facials but don't have time right now.  I find that this mask does as good a job. I have oily sensitive skin that is prone to adult acne.  I use the mask every week and my skin is beautiful.  Saves me hundreds of dollars, and I look just as good. This stuff is for real! I am always skeptical when purchasing these types of things based on the review. I was pleasantly surprised that this mask does just what it says. I will purchase it again and again. Product is a little drying to the skin, but when used with the VIA Cosmedics Cucumber gel it's amazing! I noticed that the mask has a great smell. It is light and overall the scent is very refreshing. After I removed the mask, my face felt soft and clean and just amazing. I recommend this product to everyone. At first, I wasn't expecting the  texture (It was my first mask and I was expecting a more firm texture but even with the texture of this mask, it does a great job). I really love this mask. I can feel the tightening happening and my skin feels smooth and tight for awhile after.Excellent product for the price. My face feels so much better after a treatment I'm 69 and this has left my skin pore less!!!! I have put this on auto delivery. I have used this mud mask 4 times since I purchased it.  My skin looks amazing, especially when I apply my make up.  I have recommended this product to several friends.  I will definitely purchase this product again. Love this product! Will definitely recommend it,  leaves your skin feeling and looking great. Works great!  So far I'm very happy with the results. love it ,thanks good I love this product! It comes in a small container so I was kind of bummed at first, but what little product is in here packs a powerful punch.  I highly recommend this if you're looking for a clay or mud type of mask to clarify and clear your skin. I suffer from deep cystic acne and broke out earlier this week. I put on this mud mask and I could not believe how great the results were. Within one day my pimples had disappeared and even my damage spots seem to be less noticeable.  My skin felt super soft and clear. I have a pretty sensitive skin but I didn't have any irritation from this whatsoever. The package says to leave the mask on for 10 or 15 to 20 minutes but I noticed that even after 20 minutes, the mask still was not dried so I did leave it on for longer.  It is a bit of a drying mask so if you already have dry skin, you will want to use a moisturizer following the mask.  I found that when I combined it with my acne medication that contains benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid, it was just to drying for my skin. Therefore, I would recommend maybe skipping a day of other chemical products when you use this mask. The mask it goes on really nice and smooth. I used a Q-tip to mix up the mask material as the directions say to stir it each time you're going to use it.  Then I just used the Q-tip to apply the mask and I from layer on my face.  The mask has a cooling a fact and isn't a dry or itchy at all. It was a very pleasant experience overall. It wasn't messy at all to use either. I posted some pictures below of the material in the jar as well as when it was on my face.  That way, you can see how quickly I put the mask on my face.  I hope the photos are helpful. Again, I recognize that this is a smaller container than I had previously thought, but you don't need much to cover your entire face. Although I can't say for sure, I am guessing that I would get at least 10 to 15 masks with this product. That is quite a bit considering how much is charged for mud mask facials at spas.  Do you make sure that you see all the container tightly and store it in a cool or dark place as it will dry out quickly if you leave it open. Wow! This mud mask really works.I wasn't sure what to expect, but I really just wanted to use a mask once a week that would detox and thoroughly clean my skin. My weekends are usually low key and no makeup, so starting my weekend off with a good cleansing clay mask would be perfect. The VIA megamud mask has a great proprietary formula including cucumber extract and pineapple extract, along with two high-quality types of clay mixed with volcanic ash. I thouroughly cleaned my face and neck Friday night and applied my usual night cream, so on Saturday morning I just used a wash cloth with warm water to clean my face and neck and then applied the mask. After letting it thoroughly dry to the point of cracking, I washed off all the megamud mask with warm water and then finished with ice cold water to close my pores.My face has been glowing all day! My skin looks toned, cleaned and happy. This once-a-week VIA megamud mask was the best beauty decision that I've made in a long time.I hope that this review has been helpful to you. I have really enjoyed this mud mask, so much so that I have bought one for a friend and am going to get one for my daughter for her birthday.  I will repurchase when I run out. I used the Via Cosmedics Anti-Aging Peptide MegaMud the day after I used the Perfect Image Pre-Peel Salicylic Deep Gel Exfoliating Cleanser - I say this because the cleanser shrank my pores considerably; the amount I usually get from a mud mask, so when I used this mud mask I wasn't expecting to get anymore results, but it managed to make my pores look even smaller. That is one of the benefits, and reasons I use mud masks, smaller pores! If you have those cavernous pores on your cheeks like me, then this will help.As for the MegaMud mask, it has a strong Metholatum smell to it. I mean, Mentholatum would stand up and say, ""Daaaaam!"". However, I didn't smell it after I had it on my face. I guess that sense packed up and left or blocked it out.The mask is a thin, creamy consistency that spreads super easy with great coverage, so you don't need a lot to completely cover your face. It also makes it  easy to rinse off. Some mud masks it seems like you need a chisel to remove, but not this one. Not only did it improve the appearance of my pores, but it made my skin feel smooth and soft. I wanted to use this product for several months before writing a review. I am 63 years old and am very particular about the skin care products I use on my face. I purchase high quality anti-aging products for somewhat dry and sensitive skin. Although I've had facials done in the past at medical spas, this was my first experience with a ""mud masque."" I love this product!  The mud has a unique, earthy smell that tingles once applied to the surface of the skin. I can feel the masque extracting and cleaning out my pores, especially on and around my nose. I looked in the mirror while the masque was on, and I could see my nose pores being cleaned - very cool indeed. Once rinsed off, my face feels great. The product ingredients also moisturize my skin make it glow. I plan on making anti-aging peptide megamud masque a part of my routine. I receive compliments on my skin constantly - I'm sure that this product has helped. Great, gentle mud mask. After using, I notice my skin is brighter and clearer. Hard to notice any anti-aging benefits but still a nice mask. It kind of irritates me that products like this are always targeted for women; as if men don't care about their appearance or fighting aging (OK, I guess many don't, but they're are exceptions like me).  I only used this once so far, but was truly impressed with how my skin looked afterwards.  I felt like it took 5 years off my face (I already look young for my late 40's.  This put me squarely in my late 30's).  I plan on using twice weekly and hope it has a cumulative effect.  I'm so impressed that I plan on seeing what other products I can get from the maker of this one. This mask is Amazing!! First of all it's loaded with peptides and is so moisturizing! This mask has a very nice light scent. There are no added perfumes, the scent comes from the natural extracts and oils. My face was so smooth when I removed this mask. I left the mask on for 15 minutes, which I did not mean to do, time go away from me. I meant to leave it on for only 5 minutes for my first time. My face is very sensitive and sometimes masks are too strong for me, but even with it on for 15 minutes this was very soothing and it left my face baby soft! I've used mud masks before and they have a tendency to sting and burn my face, this mask did not do that. I would recommend this mask to anyone that wants to use a mud mask but has sensitive skin. Anti-Aging Peptide MegaMud is a great product.  The Anti-Aging Peptide MegaMud is combined with Bentonite clay derived from volcanic ash and Kaolin clay from the naturally weathered rocks of France.  The Anti-Aging Peptide MegaMud is designed to combat wrinkles, clear pores, promote collagen synthesis, activate cell reproduction, improve elasticity of the skin and more.  I used this product and shared it with my mom and my brother.  It is awesome.  I can see the difference on my pores.  My face feels more refreshed after I use it.  Make sure you wash your face once the mud has dried out because the mud will start ashing out.  Once you wash out your face, add face lotion after so your face does not dry out.  Great product  to use on the times you want to unwind. Anti-Aging Peptide MegaMud is a mud mask you use a couple times a week. You apply a thin layer for up to 15 minutes and rinse off. It has a silky feel and not gritty like I have had with some mud masks. It smells fantastic. My skin feels relaxed and smooth after use. And it does not take a lot of product so this should last a couple months. This is a great edition to my current skin care regimen. I honestly love it. I definitely want to try more products from this brand. Bonus: it's cruelty free. Ladies, trust me on this one. This is definitely worth buying. I just used this tonight. First, I cleansed my skin, then used a heated facial mister to open my pores. Patted face dry, then applied this & left for 30 minutes. My face looks brighter, more even, and softer than a baby's butt. :) I'm sure within time, it'll improve even more. I've spent hundreds on high end facial products, & this mask is right on up there in terms of quality and skin performance. Love it. This is a great mud mask to use for a weekly routine. The mask is a fine smooth consistency that you apply in a thin layer over your face and let dry (which takes a few minutes) and rinse off. I use a cleansing cloth or small face towel to remove, which doubles as an exfoliator when removing. It tightens your skin and really wakes you up. Because it's not harsh, I have used it withing a few days of my previous use as a skin brightener.In the way of mud masks, I like that you can get the effects of a mud mask without having to apply a thick layer which takes 10+ minutes to dry. This is a lot faster and just as, if not more, effective, Out of all of the beauty products I have bought, which category do 75% of them fall into? That’s right, face masks. That’s why I was overjoyed when I got to try out the Via Cosmetics Mud Mask. This mask is amazing. It draws out impurities from my pores like a magnet, leaving my face feeling cleaner and more renewed than ever. It’s wonderfully moisturizing, yet does not strip my face of any nutrients. Sometimes I experience burning with other mud masks, but this one was simply relaxing to apply. There are so many minerals in this product that I’m left here wondering how they manage to keep this price this low. The day after I use it, my skin still feels flawless. The consistency is perfect; it’s not too thick, nor is it too thin. It moisturizes perfectly, but if you need that extra kick, you can follow up with a moisturizer. I recommend using a Retinol Cream or Night Cream. It’s easy to clean up, so don’t worry about a huge mess. I don’t know why I spent all that money on other masks when all I needed was this jar of magic. Don’t want to waste time and money at the spa? Now you don’t have to. Just grab a tub of this mask. This is one of the best mud masks I have ever used.  In fact, I love it so much that I have sent it to family and friends as gifts, and they love it as well.  It makes my skin feel so smooth after using it, not tight and drawn like others.  This VIA Megamud mask is full of good things for your skin, and I will continue to purchase it. The anti-aging peptide megamud has a cooling sensation when you first apply it to your skin. I would recommend washing your face before applying the megamud. When I got the anti-aging peptide mega mud, I was a little disappointed at the size of the container. After using the product I have come to realize that a small amount of the product goes a long way. You still get a good amount in the container. I do believe that this product is worth the money. After using the mega mud my skin did feel smoother and my daughter told me that it looked brighter. This product is super easy to use. Just wash your face, apply a thin layer of the mega mud, let dry (10-15 mins), wash off using warm water. Last but not least enjoy smooth skin. I received this item at a discount or gratis from the manufacturer or a seller to objectively test and review it, but received no payment and have no obligation to offer anything other than my real opinion based on my experience. I am here to provide a honest and helpful review. Please let me know if this review was helpful by answering the question under this review. This product is great for the price. It is easy to find a facial mud that becomes very expensive, very quickly. I'm unsure about the Palmitoyl Oil, but I know that Hyaluronic Acid is used in facial fillers. It obviously takes time for this product to show results and I have just recently purchased this product. This is a mask, so it is not to be rubbed in. After the product has been washed off the face does feel very soft and clean and slightly tighter. I hope for the best as many other customers have reviewed this product very highly! I purchased this product with hesitation. I am glad I took the chance because I LOVE IT!  At first, I was skeptical but after reading the reviews I took the chance and I am GLAD I DID!1. The color is gray which is a little off-putting. I was expecting / hoping for a white cream but it is mud so it's fine. I have actually come to enjoy the dark color. It gives that genuine spa feeling to the product and it is easy to know I washed it all off this way.2. The smell is very reminiscent to menthol (like Vick's vapor rub). It clears the pores and nostrils which is great! I was worried I would have a stink mud around my nose but I was pleasantly surprised.3. The next day after using this product I could see less wrinkles around my eyes! I really love this product.  The product jar reads that you can use this as a whole face mask or just a spot.  The first time I used this product I chose to use it on a spot and it worked very well.  I like the feel of the mask. The mask is not heavy which is an attribute that I like.  It is important to me that any mask I use either has a light pleasant scent or no scent at all.  This product meets that requirement.  When I read all the high end ingredients that are in this mask I was very impressed.  It seems to me that the ingredients that are used have a proven track record in anti aging.  I was given a discount for a fair review.  That being said I feel like I was extremely lucky to get this product and would purchase this product again.I am looking forward to seeing continued improvement in the fine lines and wrinkles on my face.  Very very happy with this purchase. I am cursed with oily skin and have tried several mud masks in the past. I was pleasantly surprised with this mask! The product went on smooth and evenly - not chalky or sticky. The scent is minty, so it's pleasant to sit in for 20 minutes. I immediately felt the tingle of the essential oils. After rinsing with warm water for a few minutes, the mask came off clean. My skin felt extremely clean without being overly tight. I also did not have excess shine afterwards. (A little background -- I can use the most drying products on the market and within an hour, my skin is just as oily as before!) I can see where other reviews felt the need for a moisturizer on their normal to dry skin. I did not feel that need. One benefit, I use a primer on my skin to control oil under my makeup. I used much less of that primer because there was no excessive oil on my skin the next morning. If you struggle with oily skin, this is definite worth a try. Great stuff! Honestly, I was quite skeptical about it's ""anti-aging"" benefits. I also have sensitive skin, so I was a tad hesitant to try this out. I waited for chance where I wouldn't be leaving the house for a while (just in case this stuff burned my skin off, or something), and applied it according to the directions. The smell is...different. I didn't make me want to gag, but it wasn't the most pleasant either. Upon application, during the first few minutes, I could feel a slight tingling/stinging feeling, but it quickly subsided. I left the mask on for 15 minutes, then washed it off with water. My face felt magnificent!  My face was smooth, and no kidding, I think the wrinkles between my eyebrows evened out a little! I am also happy to report that it did not burn my skin off, and I was able to go to work the following day with a clean, clear, smoothed out face. I used this product again at the end of the week, and had the same results. My husband, who is about as unobservant as one could possibly be, even commented that he thought my between-the-brow wrinkles had smoothed out a little! Now THAT is something! Oh my goodness! I love this mask.  I am the, let me wash my face in the shower with the shampoo type of gal. I don't  like the feel of lotions and potions. But once in awhile.... I take that glance in the mirror and say oh my! you gotta get with the program sister.  So google I went.. Got this mask and decided to give it a go. Put it on after I took a shower, then I cleaned the kitchen, the bathrooms, made the kids beds.... I know, I know I shouldn't have but I have that OCD thingy I think.  Decided I had just enough time to run to the store and get groceries before the monsters came home... This is the part where I fell in love with the mask and my rear view mirror... Oh THANK GOD  for the rear view mirror... I was leaving for the store and forgot I had the mask on. Backing out, the corner of my eye, I see my reflection! Oops!  I ran inside to wash the mask off. I was pleasantly surprised at how quick and easy the mask came off.  I can't believe it was so comfortable that I forgot I had it on. Trust me, that is saying a lot from the shampoo face washer lady......and yes, I did make it to the store before the monsters came home ;) My son discovered the VIA Cosmedics products and recommended that I give them a try. I have very sensitive, dry middle-aged skin, which has seen way too much sun in my younger days.  After washing my face with the Perfect Image Salicylic Deep Gel Cleanser (my new favorite cleanser!), I have been using the Anti-Aging Peptide MegaMud treatment a few times per week. I was amazed from the start at how it brought out the impurities from my problematic menopausal acne-prone areas.  My skin’s texture and pore-size have greatly improved in 3 short weeks. More importantly, the product has enhanced my skin’s ability to absorb the moisturizer, which I love!  I actually look forward to seeing my aesthetician’s reaction on our next appointment.  I am sure she will be just as impressed as I have been. Move the smell. Love the texture. My skin is tighter after use. Ive used it twice so far.The top picture is my face before, the second is my face after first use, and the bottom is my face after my 2nd use tonight. I applied this MegaMud mask thinly and it started to burn/ sting my face right away, however, I endured it about 5 minutes.My skin was flushed afterwards; I suggest that you use this at night before going to bed, as your face may be flushed for a while.The result of use is that my was skin was made significantly smooth, soft, radiant and dewy looking. The pores on my T-zone were minimized. I really this mask and it's powerful ingredients. I look forward to gradually working my way up to applying it a little thicker and waiting a little longer than the 5 minutes, for even further improved results. So far, I would definitely recommend this mask, but take it slowly. I was introduced to this mask via a promotional event whereby I purchased it at discount and this is my experience of using it. I absolutely love this mud mask. Its been a great addition to my skin care regime. It's left my skin feeling so soft and smooth. I feel good about using this mask because the ingredients are wonderful. PROS:* smoother and brighter skin after 2 times of use.* The consistency of the mud is easy to apply, which is very nice and convenient.  Some facial mud would come quite dry and hard to spread on your face.* Did not irritate my sensitive skin.  I put on a medium-thick layer and leave it on for 15 min. It was about 80% dry before I wash it off.  I suggest not to leave the mud to over 80% dry before you wash it off, it may cause your skin to dry up.CONS:* Did not really like the smell but I hate all muddy facial mask smells. This could be a pro because there is no fragrance smell. I've used this mask twice so far and am very pleased with the results. It goes on smoothly, dries in minutes and my skin feels wonderful after washing it off. Great product! Pros: The color (gray) and scent (menthol) of this mud mask are gender neutral. A little bit of the mask goes a long way. I did two treatments and barely made a dent in the supply, so I feel like you get a pretty good bang for your buck. The mask was easy to use and easy to wash off. I did notice that my face was softer immediately after and for up to 24 hours later. There also appeared to be some pore minimization after the treatment.Cons: I personally did not care for the scent, which reminded me too much of Vick's Vapor Rub. I also did not notice any reduction in fine lines, but there may be further improvement with continued use. I am a 34 year old male and I have been using this product for about two weeks.  I've tried several mud/clay products before but I am really pleased with this one! I love the smell (a mix of mint and eucalyptus) and the ease of application.  Some mud products are a bit thicker and require a bit of effort to smooth onto your skin, yet this product applies and washes off easily.  I'm not sure of the long lasting effects of the skin tightening, but I can definitely feel a difference when I rinse and dry my face.  So far I am pleased with it!  I've started a regiment of this mud, vitamin C, and hyaluronic acid - so far, my skin is looking and feeling good! Amazing feel and results from this MegaMud product!!  The mask was easy to apply and it left my skin feeling tight, smooth and refreshed.  I could actually see the impurities and oil being exfoliated from my skin by the mud mask.  There was no unpleasant smells like some of the other products I have used and the clean up was easy.  One of the best I have used and at a good price. My wife picked up this stuff for me a couple months ago since she insisted I should start using something on my face to keep me looking youthful.  Being a 30yr male I generally don't really enjoy dabbling in these kind of products.  I was compelled to write a positive review for this very reason. This stuff works!  It has a pleasant smell, leaves the skin feeling clean and rejuvenated, and both of us have noticed wrinkles disappearing around my eyes and cheeks. Take it from someone who's uses minimal cosmetic products, this stuff is a staple and I'll continue to use it! I love coating my face with a layer of this mud and sitting in my bubbly tub while it works it's magic.After rinsing, it leaves my face soft and my pores look really clean.This product has peptides to regenerate cells in aging skin.No,i's not a miracle in a jar,however,it is a fantastic pre-moisturizing cleansing and softening product for the price.I did receive a discount for my review.Thank you VIA Cosmedics LLC I haven't came across many mud mask, just Kiehl's Rare Earth Pore cleansing in the past. So I can only compare this two. This is much thicker, creamier than Kiehl's, and it has a strong minty scent which leaves a cooling sensation on the skin. However, as time past, the mintiness became more subtle, not too overpowering as I first packed it on my face. I can feel my skin tighten as the mask dries up, the color changes from dark gray to a whitish gray. I can see slight minimization of my pores, not too bad for a first attempt! I got this MegaMud as a gift and it's fantastic.  It's easy to apply AND rinse off, unlike other muds I've tried.  Even after the very first use, my skin was significantly softer and smoother - even the next morning! Because it goes on so easily, and since you only need a small amount for each mask, the jar will last for a long time.  It's got great quality ingredients that I'm comfortable using on my skin. I am in love with this mask!  Unlike others I've tried, it is not messy to apply and washes off easily.  More importantly, my skin is very happy afterwards!  I like way it ""sets"" and dries quickly; 10 minutes is usually perfect for me, even with my sensitive skin.  Afterwards, I usually apply the Via Sea Whip Cucumber Detox Soothing Gel for lush hydration... I'm hooked! I am a middle aged women with rosacea and I have very sensitive skin. I am always very careful about what I use on my face as I have had plenty of bad experiences. I have used this product 3 times and I absolutely love it! It makes my skin feel soft and smooth and I actually look forward to the next time I use it. It is very easy to use and smells refreshing. You only need a thin layer so you will get many applications from the container. My only suggestion is to make sure you stir it ( as recommended) before using as it smells better. The MegaMud is top notch! This product works wonders on my skin and it was totally noticable after my first use. My skin looks and feels smoother and softer. Another positive is that it is easy to wash off after application. Other mud masks I've tried in the past require a face towel, hot water, and lots of scrubbing which irritated my skin. VIA's mud mask has really impressed me and I'm definitely buying another once this one runs out! Big thanks! This came packaged well and super fast.  The texture is that of pudding.  It smells kind of minty and gives your face a cool feeling.  It washes off easily and it actually made my pores appear smaller the first time I used it.  I have tried many products and usually I have to wait for several application before I see results (If I do at all).  I was given a discount to review this however this is my honest opinion. I really enjoyed this mud mask. It has awesome anti-aging ingredients but still leaves the skin feeling detoxified. When it dries, it doesn't feel like it is sucking all the moisture out of your face but I do like to wash the product off my face before it completely dries. I do have dry skin & Soul already tried to not let clay mask sit on my skin for too long. Really great product. I was given a discount code for this product, but I would pay 1 million dollars for it! The mask is thick and luxurious and smells like a combo of noxema and vicks vaporub (two of my favorite smells) and while i have only used it once, my skin felt more firm and so very soft. ""This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."" One of the best I've tried. I received a sample via Tomoson and was so excited. My first mud mask experience was in high school. It was green. It was goopey. And, it dried out my face to a papery texture in about five minutes.But, this mud mask left my skin clean, clear, smooth (firm) and toned, but NOT dry.The mask is very easy to use. I simply smoothed it onto my freshly washed face in a thin layer (if you use too much, it won’t dry properly). I allowed the mask to dry completely (it took about 10 minutes). Then, I easily washed it off with warm water.The best part, though, is that the mask contains no parabens, sulfates, or harmful ingredients.5 stars I ordered the Anti-Aging MegaMud about a month ago. Since then I have used the product a few times and have been thoroughly impressed with the results. My skin feels less abrasive, smoother, and most importantly firmer around my ""wrinkle zones"". Not to mention the mud itself goes a long way! The price along with the longevity of the product makes me feel like I'm getting great bang for my buck. I will definitely be recommending MegaMud to my friends! Love these products! I've now tried 2 of the masks (mud & cucumber)...I'm a skin care/cosmetic junkie (I work in the industry as a professional makeup artist so I know the importance of a good prepped canvas!) so I'm always looking for products that work to use myself and recommend to clients! All the key benefits needed, high quality ingredients at an affordable price point! The buzz is going around about these...give a try a see for yourself!! Great mask! It compares to the expensive mud masks you can buy at Nordstrom, but its a fraction of the cost and works amazing! Once I put it on I immediately feel my skin tightening, and after I take it off my skin is absolutely glowing! Its amazing and I am noticing less breakouts! My wife has been using this product for a month, she used to have age marks in the face that are starting to go away in a natural way because of these products. The results are fantastic, fast and fenomenal - also great price for a great item. 100% recommended! I'm in love with the mask! It's so smooth, not chalkie. I just love it!!! Makes my skin so smooth and takes out.all impurities! Amazing mask...Helps exfoliate my skin and keep it looking radiant and soft. I absolutely love this product this is the easiest and most effective mask I have used so easy and so effective please make a bigger jar you have this stuff is that good a must I highly recommend it!!! Very nice and completely non irritating. I haven't noticed any anti-aging effects, but my skin does feel softer after use. Plus I look very sexy wearing the goo around the house, always a plus. Seriously tho, so far this is good stuff. This is the second time I buy this product, the first time I decided not to leave a review cause I honestly hate writing them, but I was so impressed with the product that I came back for seconds. I hope this line of anti-aging peptide makes it further. I'm a reviewer who thaught b  try this b product or since recently I've been breaking out and having oily skin.  This stuff really works is not to strong and not to thick  I love the consistency of it and how refreshing it is after you take it off. Im a guy and I unabashedly like and use this pack.I was skeptical to begin with, considering I have super sensitive skin that easily breaks out with the wrong products but this pack was a joy to apply and feel on my face. Has a mild eucalyptus-y smell when on face and as it dries. Application was simple. Wash your face, apply the paste evenly as desired and let dry for 10-15 minutes. After wash, felt my skin smoother, tighter and fresher looking. There was no smell after I washed the mud away. Would recommend this for men and women alike but like any skin product, your mileage may vary. Worth trying once to see if its a match. Also, might be helpful to note, the tub would probably allow me about 30-40 applications. I would still but this as a good investment on your skin and youthful looks. MY FRIENDS AND I DID A WINE AND MASK NIGHT AND THIS PRODUCT WAS USED WE ALL LOVED HOW WE FELT AFTER ALLOWING THIS MASK TO WORK ON OUR SKIN AMAZING PRODUCT I have very sensitive skin so most skin care products break me out. I've been using VIA for only a few weeks and I can already see and feel the difference in my skin! My skin is more vibrant, hydrated and even toned. Most importantly I have not broken out! Definitely a must have! -Annitra If you do not have time or money for a spa, here is your product. Easy to put on, perfect smooth texture. After ten minutes, your skin is cleaned of dead skin cells, brighter and also rehydrated. This stuff is amazing. The first time I used it, it greatly decreased my scowl marks between my eyebrows. I am loving the results! I just applied it for the first time.So smooth, smells fine, and leaves the skin so soft and velvety! My pores have not looked this small in a long time.  I will definitely be using this again, and again. Love love love this. I actually bought this for a gift but kept it for myself lol This mud mask is awesome! I've been using on my face and have noticed how bright and smooth my face looks! It definitely freshened my dull skin after using just twice! I highly recommend!! really good product. If feels like my face got super clean and fresh. I am goning to buy another one!!"
B06Y15C6CS," The quality of this cleansing oil exceeded my expectations - lovely scent and I have acne prone but mature skin - it has not caused me to break out at all and my skin looks hydrated and healthy...I am very pleased and am now a dedicated user..... This is a great gentle cleanser. Everything from his company is good!! Takes off makeup very quickly and leaves your skin nice and soft My face is so soft after using this. Takes all of my mascara off. I use it as a makeup remover then let it sit before I get in the shower and wash it off. When I get out I throw some on my legs and arms. I love that it comes in a pump. Removes my make perfectly and the oil has a nice scent! I'm using this for about a week or so and so far I'm very happy with the results. My face is super sensitive and i normally used very low PH soap and I still get irritated and dry I tried using coconut oil on my face for a while there and I always felt like it was big graceful and had to wipe so much off of it my face even after rinsing. So I was a little nervous about purchasing this for that same reason. But after rinsing it leaves your face feeling a little oily but then when you pet it dry it just feel so silky and soft very hydrated looking. I get a lot of skin irritation like rashes or acne, even hives and dry peeling skin and I've noticed that the inflammation is not so bad and most if my flaky skin is gone. So if you're worried about putting oils on your face to clean it this one is really nice cuz it does absorb into the skin and it doesn't leave you feeling all greasy and oily looking. Removes deep to get the old makeup off and to replace with an oil that would work to get the clean face from day-to-day activities. The Majestic Pure Camellia deep cleansing oil is good for not leaving you with dry skin that feels less alive but it does not do that. It cleans and rebuilds the skin together.I always clean my hands before removing any makeup from face or neck that is what I did when I used the Majestic Pure Camellia deep cleansing oil and then I used the product it was a different feel to my skin. Usually, I was my face with some of face washing products and then dry the face and then the moisturizer, this just completely does both of these steps. I got this oil for a few different reasons; for face cleaning and for massages because of how much my calves hurt sometimes. I'm really impressed with this cleansing oil. It cleaned my makeup right off and my face was really smooth and clean! My daughter has been using it too regularly and we can see a huge improvement of her acne. I'm gonna start using it in the shower for my stretch marks! This product is amazing, I can't suggest it enough. I use this a little differently from the directions.  I actually apply it to a cotton ball and use it to remove my makeup that way.  I also use it to remove the residual wax left when I get my eyebrows and upper lip waxed.  It removes every trace of leftover wax without rubbing or scrubbing.  Just dab it on and wipe it off.  It works better than even the wax remover my cosmetologist uses.  Love this stuff! It's seems as if my make up never really comes completely off my face. So I been trying oil cleansers to see if it'll help. Just what I was looking for, this cleaner got all my make up off after tbe first try and it didn't leave my face feeling dried out and scratchy. This is must keep in my make up box. There was no strong over powering smell and no irritation after using it about a week. I love it. This is my first time trying a cleansing oil.  I am pleasantly surprised.  I was afraid it would leave my skin oily.  It doesn't!  It is just the right mixture of clean without drying my face.  That is so important in our dry winters.  It does a great job of removing makeup too!  I will definitely be buying this again. I was hooked on this cleansing oil the second it touched my face. It tops every other cleansing oil I've used, period. Light, silky smooth texture literally melts away layers of mascara and foundation and leaves my skin feeling clean with no residue. I cannot stress enough how much I love this cleanser I love using this. I use it every night to remove my make-up. It leaves my skin soft and does not dry it out. I have never used oil to clean my face, but was pleasantly surprised at how clean and smooth it left my face with no make up residue left over. Make up came rolling off and my face was silky. I really like this, it really does help my dry skin also. I am working this into my nighty routine now. Okay, so I have a face routine that i have to do every night. I’ve been looking for a good product and i think this is it! You only need a little bit as it goes a long ways, but it leaves your face soooo soft! You can tell right away that your face is cleaner also! My search for a good product has officially ended lol you seriously won’t be disappointed I have an issue with oily skin and this cleanser works wonders. I buy and wear waterproof make up and this takes it off very well. I have had a hard time finding a good cleanser that removes my mascara. I am glad that I came across this one. I love the way it leaves my skin feeling. I really like this product! I was first introduced to washing with oil from a direct sales company I was with. I loved their oil cleanser for the face, but I ran out and since I'm no longer with them I bought this. I'm very happy with it, my face feels clean and very soft. I am so glad that I went for this and bought it! I had my daughter 8 months ago and since then I could never find a product that would help with my Stretch marks. Man does this stuff work well I can already tell that the stretch marks are getting lighter! I also use it to remove make up works fantastic! Needed extra help getting all my makeup off each night and this oil cleanser was just what I was looking for. I love Majestic Pure products and this is another great one. It's gentle on my skin, has a great mild fragrance and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean Make up is always hard to get off.  This is another great product by Majestic Pure.  It is easy to use with the pump feature and I have it sitting right by my sink.  I pump a little into a cotton swap and off my make-up goes.  The oil helps moisturize. The majestic camelli deep cleaning oil works fantastic. It removes make-up very easily.  It works wonderfully as a deep cleanser. The smell is great! The teenagers ya it and they absolutely love it. Also the size of the bottle is well worth what you pay for it.  I will but again!!! I've been using this mostly as an eye makeup remover, but it also has been great for shaving my legs. A little goes a long way.  It doesn't have a strong smell and the packaging is nice.  Arrived safely without any leaks. Yay. I bought this to use to clean my makeup brushes since it doesn't have any mineral oil in it that leaves behind residue.  So far it has worked great for me.  It kind of has like a citrusy smell, which to me smells clean. This oil smells amazing! My dry skin really loves it, especially when blending with moisturizer! Caution: do not get in your eyes. I've only used it for a few days and can already see the difference in my skin. My teenage daughter has also been using it and she really likes it too. This is the best makeup remover ever. I have oily skin, but this doesn't leave me oily at all and leaves my skin soft and smooth. It completely removes my makeup with a fresh, light scent. Love it, highly recommend. This is a fantastic makeup remover. It smells great and it wipes make up off easily even waterproof makeup. It's oil based so I like how my skin feels extra soft after use and also moisturized. I will continue to use. I always have such a hard time removing my mascara but with this cleansing oil is a breeze. It leaves my face refreshed, it does not strip my face of its natural oils and has a lovely citrus scent. Cleans makeup off easily . my biggest problem is eyeliner smearing when washing my face . using this i dont have eyeliner or mascara smears under my eyes . so im really happy with it. No complaints I love this cleanser. It leaves your skin so smooth. Just be sure to rinse thoroughly. I did experience a small breakout after my first use but after several days my skin got used to it and now it glows. My daughter has been using this to help reduce the scars from previous acne and we can see a difference wiithin the past few days!!  She is 14 and is thrilled to have found something that is helping her skin.  I can’t wait to start using it on stretchmarks to help reduce them. I bought this oil to use as a makeup remover and it works really well. It’s a great way to gently remove my eye makeup without using those wipes and having to scrub it off. Since it’s been so cold outside my skin has been extremely dry I used this oil on my skin yesterday after I got out the shower and it worked on keeping my skin hydrated and not drying out also the smell is very pleasant so all in all I’m very pleased with this product. This cleansing oil is amazing.. I've been using baby wipes to remove my makeup that always left my face super red and irritated and after using this cleanser I'll never go back! Nice and smooth. No smell. I out this on a beauty cotton ball and take off all my make up then wash my face. I can see that now I don't have residue on my white towels. I love using products with oil for my dry hair and skin, especially as winter approaches. This cleansing oil fits the bill. It leaves my skin soft and removes the day's makeup especially the delicate area right under my eye. I use with disposable cotton makeup pads, seems to absorb more (and is gentler) than a regular washcloth. This product isn't for people expecting a lathering soap face wash. I would buy again. This oil works amazingly well. I get so much dirt off my face. It even takes off makeup without a problem. I feel so refreshed afterwards!! It also smells amazing.. I'm enjoying my cleanser, at the end of everyday I use this cleanser to wash all the dirt away and it truly works. And face feels refreshed and clean no more bumps. I love this stuff.

I wasn't too sure about this product at first because I have oily skin, however you I cannot begin to tell you how incredible this product is!

I get so much dirt off my face (deliver mail) and takes off makeup without a problem. I feel so refreshed afterwards! Love love this! I was rather sceptical about this product but it was recommended by a friend so I figured I should hive it a try. It really works. I use it at night to remove my makeup.  It has helped soften my skin and leaves it feeling very refreshed. I have struggled with cystic acne for most of my teenage and adult life. All other products have helped mask my skin problems but I feel like this is actually healing. I am so grateful to have clear skin. Its calm, not red, and doesn't hurt anymore!! This doesn't clog my pores and smells great. I have never been compelled to write a review but this is absolutely game changing. Will be ordering again and again. I really like this cleanser.

Since I'm taking steps to ""up"" my facial routine now that I'm older, I wanted to try something different and they advertise deep cleaning. It is definitely more of an oil and not ""soapy"". Kind of similar to ""Cet____"" (a different popular OTC). It is gentle and removes impurities well. My skin definitely feel cleaner after use. It has helped remove trapped stuff from my pores and I'm noticing less or they are getting smaller. LOVING THIS OIL! I have been applying it in the shower after my rinsing off my body wash. I apply it to dry areas (heels, elbows, knees, legs) and to problem areas (stretch marks on hips or thighs). My skin stays softer than it has with any other moisturizer or oil, and my stretch marks are much less noticeable! GOODBYE PALMERS PRODUCTS - I will be using this from now on, it has a subtle clean scent and is 100 times more natural than any other oils out there! I bought this product on my own, without any incentive or request for my review. This oil is FANTASTIC for removing stubborn water-proof mascara before washing my face with soap, and is also very nice for a light body oil moisturizer after a shower.  I like to use it fresh out of a shower before towel drying, it just locks in the moisture of the shower water, leaving your skin silky soft and smelling slightly tropical.  Light fresh coconut smell (not like the coconut suntan lotion, just a nice LIGHT coconut smell...very refreshing). I can't rave enough about this oil. I got it a week ago and it's almost gone!  I use it to clean my face every evening. It removes all the dirt and oil and makeup and doesn't leave my face dry and tight. It smells so good!  I've also been using it as a massage oil. I have noticed a huge improvement in the crapey skin on my stomach and my stretch marks.  I gave my SIL a small bit of it and she's been using it on her daughter's diaper rash with great results.

So if you're looking for an all natural daily cleanser that does it's job... this is the best choice. Majestic Pure makes several products that I thoroughly enjoy using. It's awesome!! I have been using majestic camellia deep cleansing oil to clean My makeup every night.It takes very little amount so will last a long time.I like that it's a pump bottle. I put a little in my hand and rub on my face and use wet washcloth and rinse off. IT makes my skin feel so soft and clean.No strong scent and I would recommend to others. With my combination skin I was hesitant to use an oil at first, but this Camellia Deep cleansing oil has exceeded expectations.

I actually really love coming home at the end of a long day and using this deep cleansing oil, and how it makes my skin feel before bed! This leaves my skin soft and glowing, and has a beautiful light scent. It really feels like a deep clean with a soft, supple finish. I’m looking forward to using this in the harsh winter months when I need that little bit of extra moisture in my skin! You don’t need a lot, and I also really love a product with other uses! I have been rubbing it on stretch marks, dry elbows and knees, and it is moisturizing and smells great! As always, it is important to me to use cruelty free products with no harmful chemicals, and a natural fragrance. I am all about cleansing oil lately. I've found that soap is just too harsh on my skin and just makes it more oily and breaks me out. While this is oil, it's not what you think. I use a facial wipe to take off most of my make up and then use some cotton pads with this oil to take off my eye makeup and the remains of my face makeup that the wipes doesn't take off. It doesn't leave any residue and smells amazing, love this stuff! I use plain coconut oil to clean my face and remove my makeup, but was excited to try this out. It goes on nicely, I will say it doesn’t feel like coconut oil feels, you can tell there’s other oils in this cleanser. Coconut oil usually zaps right into the skin. I found that my makeup, even my stubborn mascara came off very easily. Rinsing off wasn’t overly difficult either, usually oils, those that don’t absorb into the skin easily are hard to get off. I think this only took me about 2-3 wipes of a warm, wet washcloth to get it off.This doesn’t really affect my review, but I really like the black lid/clear bottle/clear label packaging. I leave it out on my counter because it looks sleek. I am totally in love with Camille oil and the size of the bottle... especially for this price! Not only does it remove my makeup and deep cleans my skin, but it's also working to lighten and fade my acne scars from sooo many years ago. I can even tell an improvement on some more recent surgery scars. This oil smells great and leaves my skin feeling nourished all day. I highly recommend this product. It's awesome!! I have super sensitive skin and try to opt for more natural, gentle ingredients to use especially on my face. I heard such great things about his deep cleanser that I tried it out for myself.I only have to use just a little amount to get my daily make up off and it works like a dream. I apply it to a cotton ball when I use it to remove my eye make up. It removes all the make up and doesn't leave me looking like a raccoon afterwards. The oil absorbs quickly and I haven't have any issues with breaking out; I thought the oil would leave some sort of greasy feeling on my face, but to my surprise it didn't. The smell is pleaseant, not strong at all. I would definitely recommend. I usually use coconut oil to remove my makeup, but it's a hit or miss kind of situation. I either get too much or too little and then have to get another scoop which ends up being WAY too much. So my face is covered in coconut oil looking like a melted clown (because of course it doesn't just wipe off, you have to spend 20 minutes trying to wash it off). I was really looking for a better alternative without really harsh chemicals. I was very pleased with this camellia oil because it looked like pretty simple ingredients that did a wide variety of tasks. The acne scar reducer and massage oil PLUS being a makeup remover. Seems like a lot of bangs in one. I was very pleased with the makeup remover results. Haven't seen much with the stretch marks or acne scars. But that takes a long time of consistent use to show results. I do like it as a massage oil or a lotion, you just need to be careful how well you wash your face after removing makeup. But I really like it and it seems to do the job I bought it for. I was looking for some product that would be safe to use on a daily basis in order to remove my makeup at nights.  I have tried several cleansers, but the chemicals irritate my skin and I get redness on my face.  This Camellia oil does not have any harsh chemicals and most importantly, it is not tested on animals.  This is a big factor for me, when choosing for a cosmetic product.To me, it has no smell, which is positive.  I dab a few drops on cotton and clean my eyes and face with it.  It gets the job done.  I always rinse with cold water afterwards. So far, I'm satisfied with this Camellia oil. I purchased the Majestic Pure Camellia Deep Cleansing Oil to use specifically as a makeup remover especially for removing mascara. I love it! I pump a very small amount onto a cotton pad and wipe gently over my closed eyelids and follow up with warm water. It is a fantastic makeup remover and it leaves my skin soft and smooth. It is very gentle on my skin and I especially appreciate this product because it is all natural. I have stopped buying products that contain chemicals and fragrances added to it. This one has a very light, natural scent to it. The best makeup and mascara remover ever. I love this stuff and am buying more for Christmas gifts. I have a face regime and I added this cleanser to it and my skin is so much more cleaner and the makeup is easily removed. I love it.This is the first thing I use to remove my makeup. I substituted this for me loccitaine oil remover and now I will only use this oil cleaner vs the expensive one I had because I love the fragrance, it gets the job done, it works for my skin and it is way more cost efficient.I have a darker skin complexion and I'm more prone to discoloration. Love the product. I switched over to using cleansing oils a few months ago because I have very sensitive skin. I purchased this product to use for that purpose even though it can be used as a bath oil, massage oil and general moisturizing product. This oil removes my makeup and gently cleans my face. It leaves my skin very soft and moisturized without using an added night cream. The best part is that it doesn’t irritate my skin like most soaps do. I’ll definitely be repurchasing this in the future. I like it.It's like using an actual oil. Which means it doesn't emulsify with water. But I always do a cleanser after my cleansing oil. So that doesn't matter to me.If it is important that your cleansing oil emulsifies for you. Then this is not what you're looking for.I like that this helps remove my makeup and after using a cleanser my skin still feels soft. I have dehydrated skin that acts normal with a good skincare routine. I really love this stuff. It’s a great makeup remover and is great to add to your face wash. I’ll admit that I was nervous about putting oil on my face (I have oily skin. Oil helping oily skin????). But I’m so glad I tried it. For once, all the reviews were correct (usually it’s computer generated reviews or from people who received free products for their 5 Star review). I’ll definitely keep a bottle handy for my nightly routine! It's so hard to find an ""oil free"" makeup remover that doesn't leave your face feeling oily, greasy, or just plain dirty. Well look no further, because this is the answer to all your makeup remover prayers! This takes your makeup off so easily & leaves your face feeling overall clean. I'm obsessed with this product!!! I've been using dhc deep cleansing oil for 15 years. Lately I noticed it wasn't removing my eyeliner the way it used to. I'm not sure if they changed the formula or what, but it was very frustrating. After reading the reviews I thought I'd give this a try, and wow! It took my eyeliner right off, not a trace left. I was impressed. The only thing I didn't love is that I felt the need to then wash my face with my regular cleanser because of the oily layer on my face. I never felt that way with the dhc product. In the winter I could see just patting dry and leaving it to hydrate my skin. But nevertheless, great product, I will buy it again. It's worth the extra wash to have it remove all traces of make-up. I use this as a makeup remover. It has helped get everything off, unlike makeup remover wipes which always leave something behind. It helps my fave feel CLEAN and smooth afterwards, versus sticky and nasty. I have a hard time finding a makeup remover and face wash that doesn't dry me out or break me out, but this has been perfect. FI VE STARS! Will do business with again in the future! I’ve been using cream makeup remover for years and it was time to buy more. I talked to a few people and they all recommended an oil based one. I looked online and found this. My face has NEVER felt so good. I have pretty sensitive skin and it didn’t cause any kind of break out. I follow up with a night cream and I’m so impressed with it. Going to bed feels so good. As someone who has oily skin- super skeptical about putting oil on my face. This really takes the place of my makeup remover wipes. You’ll need to really re-wash your face though with a very good cleanser if you use this. Still doing five stars as it does he trick for any oil cleanser but keep in mind the re-wash I have been using this product for about 6 months now. It takes make up off easily, no scrubbing needed. It’s especially great at removing stubborn mascara. Even after I use a toner to remove anything remaining, my skin stays hydrated and glows. I have sensitive skin prone to eczema, and haven’t had a reaction at all. When I wear make up, I feel like it never really ALL came off. I happened to be wearing make up when this came in the mail, so I was excited to try it. After using it, I feel like it got more of my makeup off then what I have been using - if not all of it. It doesn't have a harsh smell, which has happened with some of the other products I have used in the past. It leaves my skin really soft, but not really oily feeling. Would recommend! This is a great cleansing oil. It removes make-up thoroughly and gently and has a lovely smell. I would buy again. My 13 year old daughter just started being acne this summer and is bad! I wanted to find something natural and not too harsh on her young skin. I like this oil because it has a nice scent and also seems gentle on her skin. I was worried it was going to add to her oily skin, but it didn't! Like it so far! I have been very pleased with this product so far. I have dry skin year round, as the winter dries out my skin and the summer dries it out from constant AC. This product has been a gift for my skin. I will agree with everyone that this can leave a bit of oil on your skin if just used with water. I find if I use a konjac sponge it will remove any extra residue. I know it probably will make me break out, but I can’t stop touching my skin, as it is so smooth since I’ve started using the product with a sponge. The price point is good and a little goes a long way, so I’d definitely recommend it to try. Love this cleansing oil. Removes makeup easily and leaves my skin feeling great. I've also used this as a moisturizer for stubborn dry skin and it's worked for that as well. This has quickly become my ""do it all"" oil. Great product and I would definitely buy it again! I've been trying new things in my skincare routine and a friend recommended I try this.  I was sceptical at first but I've noticed my skin is smoother and softer.  This product is not as harsh as what I'd been using on my face and I've been seeing fewer blemishes.  The scent is light and airy which is perfect for me as I don't care for strong perfume smells.  So glad I gave this a try,  it's quickly becoming a part of my regular routine! First time I’ve used a product like this and it’s great. And it smells so good! I will definitely buy this again. My face is usually very dry once its starts getting cold in the fall, so I was so happy to see that using this oil kept my skin from getting flaky. This is a great eye make up remover. It’s made with natural ingredients and oils. It’s has a wonderful light scent that’s not overpowering. I wasn’t a fan of using it for a all over face cleaner but it’s great for removing mascara etc... This seller have a spot on description of this cleansing oil. Takes a lot less of this product to,get your skin perfectly clean.  Love it & definitely recommend the Majestic Pure Camellia Deep Cleansing Oil!  Will be looking to purchase again. I got this because I as having a hard time getting my mascara off at night, and this stuff makes it slide off like BUTTER!!!  Smells so yummy too and is gentle on my face!  TWO THUMBS UP! I use this oil for so many different things. It is an amazing makeup remover, massage oil, and skin moisturizer. I like that it does all those tasks really well. I save money being able to use one product for so many things. I'm loving this makeup remover! It leaves my face feeling so clean and soft afterwards! I can already tell that my skin looks better! It only takes a small amount, so this will last a while! Definitely worth trying and I would recommend to others! This cleansing oil is amazing and smells so good. It leaves my face feeling so clean and soft without the an uncomfortable oily residue. I would definitely recommend this cleansing oil, and will be buying again soon! I love wearing black eyeliner,but found it difficult to remove,no matter what I tried. People would make comments hours after that it was still visible. I decided to try this brand because of the ingredients and because it had a pump to control the amount. It worked. It removed the stubborn eyeliner effortlessly and didn't leave my eyes feeling irritated. This cleansing oil is absolutely amazing.  Make my face so soft and smooth.  I am in my mid-40s and was experiencing some adult acne.  I felt like this oil really cleaned down deep which might have been the cause of my acne.  I've been using it for about a month and my acne is all clear now.  Highly recommend this! The Majestic Pure Camellia Deep Cleansing Oil has a very faint refreshing scent.  It is a multi-use product.  It works great at removing that stubborn mascara while moisturizing the eye area at the same time.  I like the pump bottle because it allows me better control over dispensing the oil. I have finally found a face makeup remover that does not irritate my skin nor make my face dry. I have always had an issue with my face drying out tremendously especially when having to wear makeup and now I no longer have that problem since you using this. Very happy with product. Was leary because my skin is so sensitive but my friend swears by it. I haven't used it to wash my face but does remove my eye makeup effortlessly. I now use it on my skin because it makes it so soft. I will need to buy more! This natural makeup remover completely removed eye makeup and mascara without problem. I like that it didn’t have a strong chemical type smell either. Definitely a nice alternative to some of the harsh drying products I have tried. I love this Majestic Pure Deep Cleansing Oil!!!!! It feels amazing on my skin! A little bit goes a long way and this bottle will probably last me forever and that makes me happy! I highly recommend. I've used this product for about two weeks straight now and have had great results. I feel renewed and refreshed with every use. My skin feels soft and toxin free. I love this product. I love this oil so much it is amazing I have used it everyday to remove makeup up off of my face and it takes just a little bit to remove my mascara and eye shadow it's unbelievable. it is not harsh . I also use it on my hands because where i live it is very cold and hands dry fat . i use it to massage my tense muscles I overall love it . it is just about time to order another bottle i recommend this product 100% I am completely satiated. Comes closed with a cap and you need to insert the pump. You can use this for many different purposes- makeup remover or for massages! I have oily skin and this oil is amazing, it actually takes off makeup very well.Use a kojac sponge with it! You’ll see great results. This is a great cleanser. Not harsh on the skin. Leaves it feeling clean and fresh. Takes off makeup very easy. Love the skin tightening effect afterwards and clearing the skin is amazing Have reordered.  Much prefer this over Julep's bare your face.  Comparable to dermologia at a great price point.  Even has helped my neckline and shoulders. I love the smell it absorbs and leaves the skin so soft.  I will purchase again. I love this, it’s makes my skin feel so clean and fresh. This is the best make-up remover I have ever used. I have had less breakouts since am using it as my daily skin routine. Leaves your skin moisturized with a flawless glow plus helps in toning too. Received as a gift from a family member who used this and loves it. At first I thought - cleansing oil? Do those words go together??? I’ve beenusing for a few weeks and it is by far the best makeup remover I’ve used. Even stubborn foundation and waterproof mascara come right off. Highly recommend! Works great Great cleansing oil!!!! smells great, someone gave it to my granddaughter and she loves it. leaves her skin smelling great and feeling smooth. she states her skin feels great after using it a few days. she highly recommends it This is one of the best cleansing oils I’ve every used! I have very acne prone skin and have had no issues I use this product for my stretch marks, AMAZING.I use it very sparingly,  once every 2 weeks, maybe. And the results are instant. I cant stress enough how awesome this product truly is. Love the cleansing oil great for removing makeup and skin looking fresh and clean. Haven't really used it for the acne or the scars. I have mature skin and prefer oils than makeup removing soaps. This is really nice and gentle and does not sting my eyes! I haven't use it, but it seems like a good cleaning oil"
B019I8082Y," I recently bought this Magic Korean Body Scrub and used it and my skin felt so soft after the first use!  I used it with the Salux Japanese Beauty skin bath washcloth to exfoliate my skin and did follow the instructions on Amazon that said to leave on your skin for 20 mins before rinsing and only use once a week.  I can't wait to use it again. My first time using it this. I felt that it really worked well bc my skin felt squeaky clean. I also purchased the gloves to use too. Honestly love this soap. I found that the best way to use it is to steam your skin under hot water first to sort of ""loosen"" the skin, then apply the soap everywhere and leave it on without washing off for the time shown on the soap (like 10-15 minutes). Then take an italy towel, and scrub. Literal chunks of dead skin come off, huge amounts of grey old flakes that I've never had occur with any other type of soap. This is really incredible for keratosis pilaris, and helped prevent most of the body breakouts I typically get from lifeguarding (sweat + sunscreen for long hours is not a good combination) and I noticed an improvement in skin smoothness and texture. It hasn't done that much for scars, but using this soap post chemical peel helped me get rid of the peeling skin easier. (Don't do that unless the skin's already coming off by itself  after the peel though , or you'll get skin darkening and scarring. I'm just impatient lol.) This soap also worked wonders on ingrown hairs that I had from shaving, and got rid of my godawful ""strawberry legs"". It just looks smooth and lovely. The fragrance is herbal, like ginseng. While bathing, the bathroom will smell like the soap, but I haven't found the scent to linger post shower. Its similar to other hanbang type scents, which I personally like.This soap + an italy towel + a hot shower = your new wifey, don't hesitate."
B005DE7PFG," It leaves your skin moisturized and feeling fresh and clean at the same time. All without the greasy feeling from the motorization and the dried out feeling from cleaning. I have sensitive skin with quite a bit of acne and this took it all away and gave me soft glowy, clear skin. Reasonably priced high quality face cleanser. Originally purchased from a different company but found it here on Amazon at a much better price.  The facial cleanser is amazing, I had zero reactions to the cleanser, doesn't dry, doesn't leave perfume toxic smell because it is completely organic and your skin and body know it.  I highly recommend this for anyone who has reactions and issues with toxins in personal care products. Smells a lot like ginger and nothing else,has a very fine-grained exfoliating texture,and works great at cleaning off skin-oil (and this is coming from someone who battles the dreaded, daily grease-face). Love the ginger in the face cleanser!!!  Will purchase again! Great Love it and the fact that is isn't full of chemicals that I cannot pronounce. A little bit goes a long way. Got compliments on my skin after I used for a few weeks. Nice good quality facial cleansing product. I purchased this product and it sat in my medicine cabinet unused. I ran out of my very,very expensive face wash and decided to use this product. I don't remember where I purchased it from but I love their food products and also the fact that it is organic. I started using it and noticed that my skin did not dry out or get flakey, my skin was glowing and looked great. I am going to purchase the moisturizer and see how they work together. Compared to how much I was paying for my other products this is a great Deal!"
B00BPPRY0S," I'm a new mom, and so I get to wash my face maybe twice a week. This has wrecked my complexion, breeding black heads and white heads and acne I haven't seen since I was 14.However, this scrub is divine. It sloughed off every rough spot, whitehead, blackhead, budding blemish... my skin felt like baby's skin after using this one time, and improves with each wash. As well, it isn't too rough. It also smells amazing. this is my favorite cleanser--my face feels clean, soft and smooth.  Its a mild exfoliant without drying out skin and just enough to feel clean.  Its wonderful and with sensitive skin its hard to find something I really like--this is a must have for my daily routine.  I use the wild rose serum afterwards by Korres and it makes my face feel soft all day long.  So happy to have found this line! Great for light exfoliation on a daily basis. I have dry, mildly sensitive skin, and this product does not irritate my skin at all. Me and my mom both used this we both live it. Yes it's expensive but it work the scrub feels like a scrub very high quality Great smooth & silky feeling after each use without overdrying. Fragrance is calming and not too strong. Definitely worth the price. Literally the claim that this improves skin within the first wash is absolutely legit. This cleanser has improved my skin 5x. I would also recommend the daily moisturizer. I would say that this product is superior to the milk protein product as well. Have been dealing with acne oily skin all my life & couldn't find anything to control it but this stuff keep my breakouts under control & have my skin so smooth !! very gentle and smells good. I am glad I bought it and I was able to buy it. A makeup guru I follow on YouTube suggested this on her channel great product and great service!!!! my favorite cleanser I absolutely love this product. It is spa-quality and does a real number on your face. I use it in coordination with the 24 hour moisturising cream. Loving my new face wash! excellent product this is a great cleaner buffer This cleanser works wonders. Love this stuff! Works great on my skin! Good price, fast delivery I love this product. One of the best products I've used for the price. Gentle, exfoliating, a great splurge.  Works for all skin types.  Also makes a great gift for any female ages 16-50.  Highly recommend. One of the best facial cleansers and exfoliators I've used. It makes my face feel refreshed & youthful! Better to use at night before night cream or serum. I really like it your skin feels wonderful after you use this product. Seriously the best face wash. It has the right amount of exfoliant in it, and lathers only slightly but works amazingly! Smells nice too!"
B075BGG651," I use Perfect image peels monthly but wanted something for weekly use. This can be used twice a day but can’t imagine needing to. It tingles a tiny bit when first applied, them stops quick and doesn’t feel like anything. I leave it for at least 10 minutes.You can definitely see it working to lighten my acne scars and reduce redness. Pores are smaller and overall glow to my skin. I’m 40:)I use it every other day. I already use trentinoin and hyaluronic acid nightly. Will buy again when I run out! Love it. No smell. Easy to use. Mild tingling when applied. Keeps zits small and minimal. Very happy. Will buy again Makes my skin clearer and smoother. I'm one of those people who've suffered from acne for a good 20+ years. My biggest issues have always been whiteheads and black heads, especially around my cheekbones and chin. I've tried many scrubs and treatments, some of which have brought the problem down severally, but I've always had one or two highly visual issues here or there.Until this week.I started using this product about two weeks ago and within a couple days noticed a difference, not only in the reduction of issues, but also my skin in evenness, texture and those pesky lines that are always trying to make an appearance. I then decided to use both in the morning and in the evening. Since then, I found one major blackhead, which after putting a dab of the product on it was easy to extract with a proper tool, and better yet, after doing so the area wasn't slightly red or irritated like before. The rest have seemed to wash away when I rinse.Even my fiance took notice at how my skin has changed, which to me truly says something.I can't speak for other acne issues, but if your issues are similar to mine, then this product is definitely worth a try, especially at this price. I purchased  for my young teenage daughter and just after a few days she seemed thrilled with product! She was having problems with whiteheads and blackheads. Seems to be helping."
